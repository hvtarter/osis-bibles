      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This one was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>A man came, sent from God, ˻whose name was˼ John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>That one was not the light, but came in order that he could testify about the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own things, and his own people did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they could ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed—and he did not deny, and confessed—“I am not the Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said,“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,“Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy ˻to untie˼ the strap of his sandal!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and testify that this one is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>On the next day again John was standing there, and two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and looking at Jesus as he was walking by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means when translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! ˻A true Israelite˼ in whom is no deceit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And on the third day, there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus said to her, “What ˻does your concern have to do with me˼, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now six stone water jars were set there, in accordance with the ceremonial cleansing of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, “Fill the water jars with water.” And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he said to them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward. So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it was from—but the servants who had drawn the water knew—the head steward summoned the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, “˻Everyone˼ serves the good wine first, and whenever they are drunk, the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there ˻a few˼ days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to the ones selling the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house ˻a marketplace˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>So the Jews answered and said to him, “What sign do you show to us, because you are doing these things?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then the Jews said, “This temple has been under construction forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he was speaking about the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name because they saw his signs which he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he did not ˻need˼ anyone ˻to testify˼ about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees ˻whose name was˼ Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is an old man? He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>The one who believes in him is not judged, but the one who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices ˻greatly˼ because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, because he had become tired from the journey, simply sat down at the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water to drink.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water to drink, since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But an hour is coming—and now is here—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such peopleto be his worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And at this point his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you seek?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>“Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out from the town and were coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this instance the saying is true, ‘It is one who sows and another who reaps.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of ˻what you said˼ do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This man, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>Now as he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at that same hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these thingsthere was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha, which has five porticoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these were lying a large number of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus, when he saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick a long time already, said to him, “Do you want to become well?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The one who was sick answered him, “Sir, I do not have anyone that, whenever the water is stirred up, could put me into the pool. But ˻while˼ I am coming, another goes down before me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk. (Now it was the Sabbath on that day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not permitted for you to pick up your mat!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, “The one who made me well—that one said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn while a crowd was in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well! Sin no longer, lest something worse happen to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>So Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing. For whatever that one does, these things also the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing. And greater works than these he will show him, so that you will be astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them alive, thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>in order that all people will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>“Truly, truly I say to you, that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in himself, thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>“Do not be astonished at this, because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life, but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>(And I do not receive testimony from people, but I say these things in order that you may be saved.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>That one was the lamp which was burning and shining, and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>“But I have a testimony greater than John’s, for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who sent me, that one has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you do not have his word residing in yourselves, because the one whom that one sent, in this one you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and it is these that testify about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>“I do not accept glory from people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. If another should come in his own name, you would accept that one!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How are you able to believe, if you accept glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father! The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you had believed Moses, you would believe me, for that one wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe that one’s writings, how will you believe my words?”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (that is, Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a large crowd was following him because they were observing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>So Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>˻Then Jesus, when he looked up˼  and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that these people can eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(Now he said this to test him, because he knew what he was going to do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip replied to him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for them, in order that each one could receive a little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>“Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these for so many people?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, “Make the people recline.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the bread, and after he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were reclining—likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were satisified, he said to his disciples, “Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Now when the people saw the sign that he performed, they began to say, “This one is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Then Jesus, because he knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him king, withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And getting into a boat, they began to go to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Then when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>So they said to him, “What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>So they said to him, “Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see it and believe you? What will you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>So they said to him, “Sir, always give us this bread!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Now the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>and they were saying, “Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble ˻among yourselves˼!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live ˻forever˼. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>So the Jews began to quarrel ˻among themselves˼, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also the one who eats me—that one will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats this bread will live ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He said these thingswhile teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Thus many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, “This saying is hard! Who can understand it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, because he knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Does this cause you to be offended?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, “Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>For this reason many of his disciples ˻drew back˼ and were not walking with him any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>(Now he was speaking about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, because this one—one of the twelve—was going to betray him.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And after these things Jesus was going about in Galilee. For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be ˻publicly recognized˼. If you are doing these things, reveal yourself to the world!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For not even his brothers believed in him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time is not yet completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>And when he had said these things, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others were saying, “No, but he deceives the crowd.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>˻Now when the feast was already half over˼, Jesus went to the temple courts and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>Then the Jews were astonished, saying, “How does this man ˻possess knowledge˼, because he has not been taught?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but is from the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, “I performed one work, and you are all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say, “Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts, teaching and saying, “You both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself, but the one who sent me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order ˻to take him into custody ˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said, “Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>So the Jews said to one another, “Where is this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this saying that he said, ‘You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>the one who believes in me. Just as the scripture said, ‘Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Then, when they heard these words, some from the crowd began to say, “This man is truly the Prophet!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others were saying, “This man is the Christ!” But others were saying, “No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “˻Why˼ did you not bring him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers replied, “Never has a man spoken like this!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>˻None˼ of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed in him, have they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously—who was one of them—said to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery. And standing her in their midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write with his finger on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And when they persisted in asking him, he straightened up and said to them, “The one of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>Now when they heard it, they began to depart, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and he was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>So straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Does no one condemn you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>And she said, “No one, Lord.” So Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on, sin no more.”〛</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself to be?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish ˻forever˼, and no one will seize them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can seize them from the Father’s hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>The Father and I are one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>The Jews picked up stones again so that they could stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and because you, although you are a man, make yourself to be God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them ‘gods’ to whom the word of God came—and the scripture cannot be broken—</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do you say about he whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I do not do the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>So they were seeking again to seize him, and he departed out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to him and began to say, “John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent word to him, saying, “Lord, behold, the one whom you love is sick.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>And when he heard it, Jesus said, “This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>(Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>So when he heard that he was sick, then he remained in the place ˻where˼ he was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were seeking just now to stone you, and are you going there again?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He said these things, and after this he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>(Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about ˻real sleep˼.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus has died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and I am glad ˻for your sake˼ that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go also, so that we may die with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>So Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever you ask God, God will grant you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die ˻forever˼. Do you believe this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>So that one, when she heard it, got up quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary—that she stood up quickly and went out—followed her, because they thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>So the Jews were saying, “See how he loved him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, “Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something so that this man also would not have died?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, “Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above and said, “Father, I give thanks to you that you hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The one who had died came out, his feet and his hands bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped with a facecloth. Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, “You do not know anything at all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>(Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day they resolved that they should kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another while standing in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it, in order that they could arrest him.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of very valuable genuine nard and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>“˻Why˼ was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>(Now he said this not because ˻he was concerned˼ about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now the large crowd of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out,“Hosanna!Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord,even the king of Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>So Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion!Behold, your king is coming,seated on the foal of a donkey!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>(His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this reason I have come to this hour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Now the crowd that stood there and heard it said ˻it had thundered˼. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains ˻forever˼! And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and then he went away and was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But as many signs as he had performed before them, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,“Lord, who has believed our message?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts,lest they see with their eyesand understand with their heartsand turn, and I heal them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them, I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me ˻has commanded me˼ what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So the things that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, and having loved his own in the world, loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And as a dinner was taking place, when the devil had already put into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot that he should betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>because he knew that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he had come forth from God and was going away to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>he got up from the dinner and took off his outer clothing, and taking a towel, tied it around himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them dry with the towel ˻which he had tied around himself˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet ˻forever˼!” Jesus replied to him, “Unless I wash you, you do not have a share with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed ˻only needs˼ to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, “Not all of you are clean.”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak correctly, for I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If then I—your Lord and Teacher—wash your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have given you an example, that just as I have done for you, you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If you understand these things, you are blessed if you do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>“I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>From now on I am telling you before it happens, in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When he had said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, “Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples began looking at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining ˻close beside˼ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Then he leaned back accordingly against Jesus’ chest and said to him, “Lord, who is it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus replied, “It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” Then after dipping the piece of bread, he took it and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do quickly!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>(Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Purchase ˻what we need˼ for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter was standing there and warming himself. So they said to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>So Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s residence. Now it was early, and they did not enter into the governor’s residence so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said to him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>So Pilate said to them, “You take him and judge him according to your law!” The Jews said to him, “It is not permitted for us to kill anyone,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken, indicating by what sort of death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered again into the governor’s residence and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus replied, “Do you say this from yourself, or have others said this to you about me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your people and the chief priests handed you over to me! What have you done?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus replied, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Then Pilate said to him, “So then you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I have come into the world: in order that I can testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no basis for an accusation against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But it is your custom that I release for you one prisoner at the Passover. So do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they shouted again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and put a purple robe on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and were coming up to him and saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” and were giving him slaps in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate said to them, “You take him and crucify him! For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews replied to him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>So Pilate said to him, “Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus replied to him, “You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this point on Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>So Pilate, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in the place called The Stone Pavement (but Gabbatha in Aramaic).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, “Behold your king!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>Then those shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests replied, “We do not have a king except Caesar!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified.So they took Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the place called The Place of a Skull (which is called Golgotha in Aramaic),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, ˻one on each side˼, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it on the cross, and it was written: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, I am king of the Jews.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top ˻in a single piece˼.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, to see whose it will be,” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says,“They divided my garments among themselves,and for my clothing they cast lots.”Thus the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>So Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed,” and bowing his head, he gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, after they saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And the one who has seen it has testified, and his testimony is true, and that person knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph who was from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed it, so he came and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews’ custom to prepare for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now there was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, “They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two were running together, and the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And bending over to look, he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, though he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>So then the other disciple who had come to the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>(For they did not yet know the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had said these things, she turned ˻around˼ and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Now when it was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands, and place your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed himself in this way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter and Thomas (who was called Didymus) and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing!” They said to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into the boat, and during that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Now when it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>So Jesus said to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered him, “No.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said to them, “Throw the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they threw it, and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” So Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net of fish, because they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>So when they got out on the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net to the land, full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three—and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Shepherd my sheep!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I love you!” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly I say to you, when you were young, you tied your clothes around yourself and walked wherever you wanted. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will tie you up and carry you where you do not want to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>(Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God.) And after he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them (who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>So when he saw this one, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, but what about this one?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who is testifying about these things, and who has written down these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which—if they were written down one after the other—I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.</verse>
