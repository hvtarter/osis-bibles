  <div type='book' osisID='1Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always concerning all of you, making mention constantly in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>because we remember your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brothers dearly loved by God, ˻that he has chosen you˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our gospel did not come to you with word only, but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty, just as you know what sort of people we became among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>for from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves report about us, what sort of welcome we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to await his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, the one who delivers us from the coming wrath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, our reception with you, that it was not in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi, just as you know, we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not from error or from impurity or with deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, thus we speak, not as pleasing people but God, who examines our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>˻For never˼ did we come with a word of flattery, just as you know, nor with a pretext of greediness (God is witness),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking glory from people, neither from you nor from others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>˻Although we could have insisted on our own importance˼ as apostles of Christ, yet we became infants in your midst, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Longing for you in this way, we determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working by night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we became to you who believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>just as you know how we treated each one of you, like a father his own children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly, that when you received God’s word ˻that you heard˼ from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you became imitators, brothers, of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you also suffered the same things at the hands of your own people, just as they themselves did also at the hands of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and who persecuted us, and who are not pleasing to God and are opposed to all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles in order that they may be saved, so that they always fill up their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But when we were made orphans by separation from you, brothers, for ˻a short time˼ (in face, not in heart), we were even more eager with great desire to see your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, ˻on more than one occasion˼—and Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For who is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we determined to be left behind in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, in order to strengthen and to encourage you about your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed for this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>for indeed when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were about to be afflicted, just as indeed it happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Because of this, I also, when I could endure it no longer, sent in order to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter tempted you and our labor should be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now, because Timothy has come to us from you and has brought good news to us of your faith and love, and that ˻you always think kindly of us˼, desiring to see us just as also we desire to see you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this, brothers, we have been comforted because of you in all our distress and affliction through your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we repay to God concerning you, because of all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying beyond all measure that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and may the Lord cause you to increase and to abound in love for one another and for all, just as also we do for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>so that your hearts may be established blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally therefore, brothers, we ask you and appeal to you in the Lord Jesus that, just as you have received from us how it is necessary for you to live and to please God, just as indeed you are living, that you progress even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commands we gave to you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in lustful passion, just as also the Gentiles who do not know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>not to transgress and to exploit his brother in the matter, because the Lord is the one who avenges concerning all these things, just as also we told you beforehand and testified solemnly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to impurity, but in holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore the one who rejects thisis not rejecting man, but God, who also gives his Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning brotherly love, I do not have need to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to progress even more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to aspire to live a quiet life, and to attend to ˻your own business˼, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>so that you may live decently toward those outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you will not grieve as also the rest, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, thus also God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the Lord’s coming, will not possibly precede those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive, who remain, will be snatched away at the same time together with them in the clouds for a meeting with the Lord in the air, and thus we will be together with the Lord always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need of anything to be written to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for you yourselves well know that the day of the Lord is coming in the same way as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>Whenever they say “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction will overtake them like the birth pains of ˻a pregnant woman˼, and they will not possibly escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in the darkness, so that the day should catch you like a thief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But because we are of the day, we must be sober, by putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore encourage one another and build up ˻each other˼, just as indeed you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good, both toward one another and toward all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>pray constantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophecies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>but examine all things; hold fast to what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>The one who calls you is faithful, who also will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
