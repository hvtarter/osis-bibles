      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I hear about your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, although I have great confidence in Christ to order you to do what is proper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>instead I appeal to you because of love, since I am such a one as Paul, now an old man and also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I am appealing to you concerning my child whom I became the father of during my imprisonment, Onesimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I have sent back to you himself, that is, my heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I wanted to keep with me, in order that he might serve me on behalf of you during my imprisonment for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But apart from your consent, I wanted to do nothing, in order that your good deed might be not as according to necessity, but according to your own free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps because of this, he was separated from you for a time, in order that you might have him back forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If therefore you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>But if in anything he has caused you loss or owes you anything, ˻charge this to my account˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay it back, lest I mention to you that ˻you owe me even your very self besides˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, I ought to have some benefit of you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
