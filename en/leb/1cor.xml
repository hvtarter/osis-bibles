  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God that is in Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to my God always concerning you, because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you were made rich in him, in all speech and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same thing and there not be divisions among you, and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by ˻Chloe’s people˼, that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>But I say this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” and “I am with Apollos,” and “I am with Cephas,” and “I am with Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with ˻clever speech˼, lest the cross of Christ be emptied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written,“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were well born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that all flesh may not boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But just as it is written,“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,and have not entered into the heart of man,are the things which God has prepared for those who love him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>“For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly people, as to infants in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to eat it. But now you are still not able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still fleshly. For where there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like unregenerate people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For whenever anyone says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing it to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing it to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon it. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone’s work that he has built upon it remains, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are God’s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy this one. For God’s temple is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, “The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then, let no one boast in people. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all thingsare yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court, but I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is reported everywhere that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which does not even exist among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For although I am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this in this way, as if I were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and my spirit, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>I have decided to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what is it to me to judge those outside? Should you not judge those inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those outside God will judge. Remove the evil person ˻from among yourselves˼.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Does anyone among you, if he has a matter against someone else, dare to go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat these despised people in the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you wrong and defraud, and do this to brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And some of you were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are permitted for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be controlled by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish ˻both of them˼. Now the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For it says, “The two will become one flesh.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things about which you wrote: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then you should be ˻together˼ again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this as a concession, not as a command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain as I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I command—not I, but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called you in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone called after being circumcised? He must not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? He must not become circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called while a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedperson. Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Each one in the situation in which he was called, brothers—in this he should remain with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that it is good for a man to be thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those who weep as if they do not weep, and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice, and those who buy as if they do not possess,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime and it ought to be thus, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, and the one who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives. But if her husband ˻dies˼, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she remains thus, according to my opinion—and I think I have the Spirit of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world” and that “there is no God except one.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>But this knowledge is not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat this food as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>But food does not bring us close to God. Neither if we do not eat do we lack, nor if we do eat do we have more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, because it is weak, be strengthened so that he eats the food sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>Now if you sin in this way against the brothers and wound their conscience, which is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat ˻forever˼, in order that I may not cause my brother to sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>But I have not made use of any of these rights. And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me. For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>For if I proclaim the gospel, it is not to me a reason for boasting, for necessity is imposed on me. For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.18'>What then is my reward? That when I proclaim the gospel, I may offer the gospel free of charge, in order not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.19'>For although I am free from all people, I have enslaved myself to all, in order that I may gain more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.20'>I have become like a Jew to the Jews, in order that I may gain the Jews. To those under the law I became as under the law (although I myself am not under the law) in order that I may gain those under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.21'>To those outside the law I became as outside the law (although I am not outside the law of God, but subject to the law of Christ) in order that I may gain those outside the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>To the weak I became weak, in order that I may gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, in order that by all means I may save some.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.25'>And everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. Thus those do so in order that they may receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members ˻of it individually˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all are workers of miracles, are they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak with tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a ringing brass gong or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I parcel out all my possessions, and if I hand over my body in order that I may boast, but do not have love, it benefits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, it does not boast, it does not become conceited,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>it does not behave dishonorably, it˻is not selfish˼, it does not become angry, it does not keep a record of wrongs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>it does not rejoice at unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but whenever the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside the things of a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see through a mirror ˻indirectly˼, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know completely, just as I have also been completely known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and strive for spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, because no one understands, but by the Spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I want you all to speak with tongues, but even more that you may prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>˻Therefore what should I do˼? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written:“By those who speak a foreign languageand by the lips of othersI will speak to this people,and not even in this way will they obey me,”says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>˻Therefore what should you do˼, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things must be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and ˻one after the other˼, and one must interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you are all able to prophesy ˻in turn˼, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that the things which I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you, unless you believed to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I passed on to you ˻as of first importance˼ what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, the majority of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>and last of all, as it were to one born at the wrong time, he appeared also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain, but I labored even more than all of them, and not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore whether I or those, in this way we preached, and in this way you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, Christ has not been raised either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>But if Christ has not been raised, then both our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And also we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if after all, then, the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is empty; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If ˻we have put our hope˼ in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since through a man came death, also through a man came the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at his coming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For “he subjected all things under his feet.” But when it says “all things” are subjected, it is clear that the one who subjected all things to him is not included.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But whenever all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him, in order that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, why do they do it, those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I die every day—yes indeed, by my boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit is it to me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived! “Bad company corrupts good morals.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Sober up correctly and ˻stop sinning˼, for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow is not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly bodiesis of one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodiesis of another kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is from the earth, made of earth; the second man is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As the one who is made of earth, so also are those who are made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body to put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place:“Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about it to the churches of Galatia, so you do also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>On the first day of the week, each one of you ˻put aside˼something, saving up ˻to whatever extent he has prospered˼, in order that whenever I come, at that time collections do not take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.4'>And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.5'>But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.6'>and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.8'>But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.9'>for a great and effective door has opened for me, and there are many opponents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many times that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has an opportunity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.14'>All your actions must be done in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.15'>Now I urge you, brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.16'>that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.17'>Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence,</verse>
