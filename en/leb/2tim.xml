  <div type='book' osisID='2Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>˻I am thankful˼ to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience ˻as my ancestors did˼, when ˻I remember you constantly˼ in my prayers night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see you as I remember your tears, so that I may be filled with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>˻remembering the˼ sincere faith in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that is in you also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>for which reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love and self-discipline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor me his prisoner, but suffer along with me for the gospel, according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace that was given to us in Christ Jesus ˻before time began˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>but has now been disclosed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and brought to light life and immortality through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>for which I was appointed a proclaimer and an apostle and a teacher,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>for which reason also I suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, because I know in whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted until that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>You know this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he refreshed me many times, and was not ashamed of my imprisonment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>but when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day! And how much he served me in Ephesus you know very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>and the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these things to faithful people who will be competent to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Suffer together with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No one who serves as a soldier is entangled in the activities of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And also if anyone competes he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The farmer who works hard must be the first to receive a share of the crops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will grant you understanding in all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David according to my gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in connection with which I suffer misfortune to the point of ˻imprisonment˼ as a criminal, but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Because of this, I endure all things for the sake of the chosen, in order that they also may obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>The saying is trustworthy:For if we died with him, we will also live with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>if we endure, we will also reign with him;if we deny him, he also will deny us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, ˻because he cannot deny himself˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind people of these things, solemnly urging them before God not to dispute about words. This is in no way beneficial and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, a worker having no need to be ashamed, guiding the word of truth along a straight path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But avoid pointless chatter, for it will progress to greater ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and their message ˻will spread˼ like gangrene, among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who have deviated concerning the truth by saying the resurrection has already taken place, and they are upsetting the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>However, the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who names the name of the Lord must abstain from unrighteousness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>Now in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthenware ones, some of which are for honorable use, and some of which are for ordinary use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>Therefore, if someone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>But flee from youthful desires, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in company with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But avoid foolish and uninformed controversies, because you know that they produce quarrels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And the slave of the Lord must not quarrel, but be kind toward everyone, skillful in teaching, tolerant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>correcting those who are opposed with gentleness, seeing whether perhaps God may grant them repentence to a knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they will come to their senses again and escape from the trap of the devil, being held captive by him to do his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>for people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>hardhearted, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, with no interest for what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>maintaining a form of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For from these are those who slip into houses and captivate foolish women loaded down with sins, led by various kinds of desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And ˻just as˼ Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, people corrupted in mind, disqualified concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they will not progress to a greater extent, for their folly will be quite evident to everyone, as also the folly of those two was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But you have faithfully followed my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra, what sort of persecutions I endured, and the Lord delivered me from all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>And indeed, all those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil people and imposters will progress to the worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But you continue in the things which you have learned and are convinced of, because you know from whom you learned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>and that from childhood you have known the holy writings that are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>in order that the person of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>preach the word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For there will be a time when they will not put up with sound teaching, but in accordance with their own desires, they will accumulate for themselves teachers, ˻because they have an insatiable curiosity˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and they will turn away from the hearing of the truth, but will turn to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But you, be self-controlled in all things, bear hardship patiently, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is imminent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have completed the race, I have kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Finally, the crown of righteousness is reserved for me, that the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Make haste to come to me quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For Demas deserted me, because he loved the present age, and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia; Titus went to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Luke alone is with me. Take along Mark and bring him with you, because he is useful to me for ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>When you come, bring the cloak that I left behind in Troas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the metalworker did me much harm; may the Lord pay back to him according to his deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>against whom you also be on guard, because he vehemently opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defense, no one came to my aid, but they all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord helped me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fulfilled and all the Gentiles might hear, and he rescued me from the lion’s mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Greet Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in Miletus because he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</verse>
