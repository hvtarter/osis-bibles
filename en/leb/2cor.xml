  <div type='book' osisID='2Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in all affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope for you is firm, because we know that as you are sharers in the sufferings, so also you will be sharers in the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction that happened in the province of Asia, that we were burdened to an extraordinary degree, beyond our strength, so that we were in despair even of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a risk of death, and will deliver us, in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver us again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>while you also join in helping ˻on our behalf˼ by prayer, so that thanks may be given ˻on our behalf˼ by many persons for this gracious gift given to us through the help of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our reason for boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you, in sincerity and purity of motive from God and not in merely human wisdom, but by the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand. But I hope that you will understand ˻completely˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore, when I was wanting to do this, perhaps then was I making use of vacillation? Or was I deciding what I was deciding according to the flesh, in order that with me my “yes” may be “yes” and my “no” may be “no” at the same time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But God is faithful, so that our word to you is not “yes” and “no.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become “yes” and “no,” but has become “yes” in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are “yes”; therefore also through him is the “amen” to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call upon God as witness against my life, that in order to spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>For I have decided this for myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I cause you sorrow, then who will make me glad except the one who is caused to be sad by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing in order that when I came, I would not experience sorrow from those who ought to have made me glad, because I have confidence about you all, that my joy ˻belongs to all of you˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not so that you may be caused to be sad, but so that you may know the love that I have especially for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me sorrow, but ˻to some degree˼—˻in order not to say too much˼—to all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So then, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest somehow this person should be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I urge you to confirm your love for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>Because for this reason also I wrote, in order that I could know your proven character, whether you are obedient in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now to whomever you forgive anything, I also do; for indeed, whatever I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is˻for your sake˼ in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>in order that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I arrived in Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened for me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I did not experience rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother, but saying farewell to them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to those on the one hand an odor from death to death, and to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life. And who is qualified for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God, but as from pure motives—but as from God—we speak before God in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we, like some, need letters of recommendation to you or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also makes us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was transitory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case, on account of the glory that surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if what was transitory came with glory, by much more what remains is with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore, because we have such a hope, we use much boldness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face, in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were hardened. For until this very day, the same veil remains upon the reading of the old covenant, not being uncovered, because it is done away with in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But until today, whenever Moses is read aloud, a veil lies upon their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>but whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all, with unveiled face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory into glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Because of this, since we have this ministry, just as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but we have renounced shameful hidden things, not behaving with craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but with the open proclamation of the truth commending ourselves to every person’s conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if indeed our gospel is veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they would not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for the sake of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God who said, “Light will shine out of darkness,” is the one who has shined in our hearts for the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthenware jars, in order that the extraordinary degree of the power may be from God and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always carrying around the death of Jesus in our body, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who are alive are continually being handed over to death because of Jesus, in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then, death is at work in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>But because we have the same spirit of faith in accordance with what is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us together with Jesus and present us together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all these things˻are for your sake˼, in order that the grace that is increasing through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not lose heart, but even if our outer person is being destroyed, yet our inner person is being renewed day after day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light affliction is producing in us an eternal weight of glory ˻beyond all measure and proportion˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>because we are not looking at what is seen, but what is not seen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is not seen is eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house, the tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For indeed, in this house we groan, because we desire to put on our dwelling from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed, even after we have taken it off, we will not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For indeed we who are in this tent groan, being burdened ˻for this reason, that˼ we do not want to be unclothed, but to be clothed, in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now the one who has prepared us for this very thingis God, who has given us the down payment, the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore, although we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>for we live by faith, not by sight—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>so we are confident and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore indeed we have as our ambition, whether at home in the body or absent from the body, to be acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, in order that each one may receive back the things through the body according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we are attempting to persuade people, but we are revealed to God, and I hope to be revealed in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us, in order that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are out of our senses, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one died for all; as a result all died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And he died for all, in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for the one who died for them and was raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So then, from now on we know no one ˻from a human point of view˼, if indeed we have known Christ ˻from a human point of view˼, but now we know him this way no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all these thingsare from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Therefore we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as if God were imploring you through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>He made the one who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he says,“At the acceptable time I heard you,and in the day of salvation I helped you.”Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>We are giving no one an occasion for taking offense in anything, in order that our ministry will not have fault found with it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but commending ourselves as servants of God in every way, in much endurance, in afflictions, in distresses, in difficulties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in beatings, in prisons, in disturbances, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in going hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love without hypocrisy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and left hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and dishonor, through slander and good repute, regarded as deceivers and yet truthful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown and yet known completely, as dying, and behold, we go on living, as disciplined, and yet not put to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as grieving, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and possessing everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>˻We have spoken freely and openly˼ to you, Corinthians; our heart is open wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now the same wayin exchange (I am speaking as to children), you open wide your hearts also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers, for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said,“I will live in them and will walk about among them,and I will be their God and they will be my people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore “come out from their midstand be separate,” says the Lord,“and do not touch what is unclean,and I will welcome you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and I will be a father to you,and you will be sons and daughters to me,”says the all-powerful Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Therefore since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of body and spirit, accomplishing holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>˻Make room for us in your hearts˼. We have wronged no one, we have ruined no one, we have defrauded no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not say this˻to condemn you˼, because I have already said that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my confidence toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our body had no rest, but we were afflicted in every way—quarrels outside, fears within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you, because he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For if indeed I grieved you by my letter, I do not regret it (even if I did regret it), for I see that that letter grieved you, even though for ˻a short time˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I do not rejoice that you were grieved, but that you were grieved to repentence. For you were grieved according to the will of God, so that you suffered loss in no way through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For grief according to the will of God brings about a repentence leading to salvation, not to be regretted, but worldly grief brings about death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold how much diligence this very thing, being grieved according to the will of God, has brought about in you: what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Consequently, even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged, but in order that your diligence ˻on our behalf˼ might be revealed to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Because of this we have been encouraged, and in addition to our encouragement, we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if I have boasted anything to him about you, I have not been put to shame, but as I have spoken everything to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus ˻has proven to be true˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection for you is all the more when he remembers the obedience of all of you as you welcomed him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice, because in everything I am completely confident in you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Now we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that with a great ordeal of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extreme depth of their poverty have overflowed to the wealth of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>I testify that they gave according to their ability, and beyond their ability, by their own choice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>and not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun it, thus he would also complete for you this act of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But just as you excel in everything—in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us that is in you—so may you excel in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I am not saying this as a command, but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, for your sake he became poor, in order that you, by his poverty, may become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And I am giving an opinion in this matter, because this is profitable for you who not only began previously, a year ago, to do something, but also to want to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>So now also complete the doing of it, in order that just as you have the eagerness to want to do it, thus also you may complete it from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the eagerness is present ˻according to what one has˼, it is acceptable not ˻according to what one does not have˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For this is not that for others there may be relief, and for you difficult circumstances, but as a matter of equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>At the present time your abundance will be for their need, in order that their abundance may also be for your need, so that there may be equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>just as it is written, “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion ˻on your behalf˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>because he not only welcomed our request, but being very earnest, by his own choice he went out to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel has become known throughout all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not only this, but he was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>We are trying to avoid this, lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord, but also before people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many things that he is diligent, but now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If there is a question concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. If there is a question concerning our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you ˻openly before˼ the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For it is unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the ministry to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>because I know your readiness to help, concerning which I keep on boasting to the Macedonians about you, that Achaia has been ready to help since last year, and your zeal has stirred up the majority of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case, so that you may be prepared just as I was saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared, we—˻not to speak of you˼—would be humiliated in connection with this project.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously, so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>Now the point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Each one should give as he has decided in his heart, not ˻reluctantly˼ or from compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you, so that in everything at all times, because you have enough of everything, you may overflow in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>Just as it is written,“He scattered widely, he gave to the poor;his righteousness remains ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed, and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>being made rich in every way for all generosity, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>Through the proven character of this service they will glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your participation toward them and toward everyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and they are longing for you in their prayers for you, because of the surpassing grace of God to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I, Paul, appeal to you myself by the humility and gentleness of Christ, who ˻when I am present in person˼am humble among you, but when I am absent am bold toward you—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>now I ask when I am present that I will not need to be bold with the confidence with which I propose to show boldness toward some who consider us as behaving according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For although we are living in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human, but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses, tearing down arguments</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And ˻we are ready˼ to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>You are looking at things according to appearance. If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ’s, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us˻for building you up and not for tearing you down˼, I will not be put to shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>because it is said, “His letters are severe and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, we will also be in ˻actions˼when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but they themselves, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast ˻beyond limits˼, but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting ˻beyond limits˼ in the labors of others, but having hope that as your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But “the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I wish that you would put up with me ˻in something a little foolish˼—but indeed you are putting up with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present youas a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I am afraid lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of devotion to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed, or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you put up with it well enough!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider myself in no way to be inferior to the preeminent apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; certainly in everything we have made this clear to you in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself in order that you may be exalted, because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you without payment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them for the ministry to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And when I was present with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will keep myself from being a burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting ˻of mine˼ will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>˻Why˼? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I am doing, I will also do, in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity, that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, do not let anyone think I am foolish. But indeed, if you do, accept me even as foolish, in order that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I am saying in this project of boasting, I am not saying as the Lord would say, but as in foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many are boasting according to human standards, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For because you are wise, you put up with foolish people gladly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is presumptious toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I say this to my shame, namely, that we have been weak.But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? I am also! Are they Israelites? I am also! Are they descendants of Abraham? I am also!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they servants of Christ?—I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with beatings to a much greater degree, in danger of death many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked. A day and a night I have spent in the deep water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers because of false brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>with toil and hardship, often in sleepless nights, with hunger and thirst, often going hungry, in cold and poorly clothed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Apart from these external things, there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to sin, and I do not burn with indignation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If it is necessary to boast, I will boast about˻the things related to my weakness˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed ˻forever˼, knows that I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to take me into custody,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>and I was lowered through a window through the wall in a rope-basket, and I escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>It is necessary to boast; it is not profitable, but I will proceed to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>and I know this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows—</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up to paradise and heard words not to be spoken, which it is not permitted for a person to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I want to boast, I will not be foolish, because I will be telling the truth, but I am refraining, so that no one can credit to me more than what he sees in me or hears anything from me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, because the power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may reside in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool! You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles, even if I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Indeed, the signs of an apostle have been done among you with all patient endurance, both signs and wonders and deeds of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>˻For in what respect are you made worse off˼ more than the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>But I will spend and be expended most gladly for your lives. If I love you much more, am I to be loved less?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But let it be. I have not been a burden to you, but because I was crafty, I took you by cunning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>I have not taken advantage of you ˻through anyone whom I sent to you˼, have I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same footsteps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in Christ before God, and all these things, dear friends, are for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I am afraid lest somehow when I arrive, I will not find you as I want, and I may be found by you as you do not want. I am afraid lest somehow there will be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, pride, disorder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>I am afraid lest when I come again my God will humiliate me ˻in your presence˼, and I will grieve over many of those who sinned previously and have not repented because of their impurity and sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This is the third time I am coming to you. ˻By the testimony˼ of two or three witnesses every word will be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have already said when I was present the second time, and although I am absent now I also say in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare anyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since you are demanding proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you, is speaking in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For indeed, he was crucified because of weakness, but he lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him because of the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are unqualified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>And I hope that you will recognize that we are not unqualified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now we pray to God that you not do wrong in any way, not that we are seen as approved, but that you do what is good, even though we are seen as though unqualified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but rather only for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong, and we pray for this: your maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Because of this, I am writing these thingsalthough I am absent, in order that when I am present I may not have to act severely according to the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally, brothers, rejoice, be restored, be encouraged, ˻be in agreement˼, be at peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.</verse>
