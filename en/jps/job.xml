      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: 'It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.' Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan    came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Whence comest thou?' Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'Doth Job fear God for nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.' So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: 'The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'A fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: 'Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And he said; naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither; the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>For all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed aught unseemly to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'From whence comest thou?' And Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against him, to destroy him without cause.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD, and said: 'Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said unto Satan: 'Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him: 'Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? blaspheme God, and die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her: 'Thou speakest as one of the impious women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?' For all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and threw dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job spoke, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was said: 'A man-child is brought forth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let not God inquire after it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be desolate; let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of my  mother's  womb, nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there alike; and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherewith is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice unto exultation, and are glad, when they can find the grave?--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing cometh instead of my food, and my roarings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not at ease, neither was I quiet, neither had I rest; but trouble came.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; it toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow mischief, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth--yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a word was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were made to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face, that made the hair of my flesh to stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>'Shall mortal man be just before God? Shall a man be pure before his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants, and His angels He chargeth with folly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered; they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For anger killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root; but suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, and are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>So that He setteth up on high those that are low, and those that mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands can perform nothing substantial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But He saveth from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For He maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and His hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine He will redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances altogether!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore are my words broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up; the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the juice of mallows?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as the sickness of my flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to crush me; that He would let loose His hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain, though He spare not; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is mine end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is it that I have no help in me, and that sound wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend, even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that overflow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are black by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they wax warm, they vanish, when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their way do wind, they go up into the waste, and are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came thither, and were confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now ye are become His; ye see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say: 'Give unto me'? or: 'Offer a present for me of your substance'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>or: 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? or: 'Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are words of uprightness! But what doth your arguing argue?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye hold words to be an argument, but the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; for surely I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern crafty devices?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not a time of service to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow, and as a hireling that looketh for his wages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>So am I made to possess--months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down, I say: 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>O remember that my life is a breath; mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; while Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.10'>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.11'>Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.12'>Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, or his proud talk, or his fair array of words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.13'>Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.14'>Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.15'>His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.16'>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.17'>They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot and burning rushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>In his neck abideth strength, and dismay danceth before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>The flakes of his flesh are joined together; they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.25'>When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; by reason of despair they are beside themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.26'>If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.27'>He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Clubs are accounted as stubble; he laugheth at the rattling of the javelin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>Sharpest potsherds are under him; he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a seething mixture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.33'>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made to be fearless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.34'>He looketh at all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered the LORD, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that Thou canst do every thing, and that no purpose can be withholden from Thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech Thee, and I will speak; I will demand of Thee, and declare Thou unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Wherefore I abhor my words, and repent, seeing I am dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: 'My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt- offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I do not unto you aught unseemly; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them; and the LORD accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah;    and the name of the second, Keziah;    and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.</verse>
