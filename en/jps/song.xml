        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Look not upon me, that I am swarthy, that the sun hath tanned me; my mother's sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; for why should I be as one that veileth herself beside the flocks of thy companions?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in through the windows, he peereth through the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved spoke, and said unto me: 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen that go about the city found me: 'Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>Scarce had I passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.7'>Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>They all handle the sword, and are expert in war; every man hath his sword upon his thigh, because of dread in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>He made the pillars thereof of silver, the top thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple, the inside thereof being inlaid with love, from the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and gaze upon king Solomon, even upon the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes all shaped alike, which are come up from the washing; whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely; thy temples are like a pomegranate split open behind thy veil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Thy neck is like the tower of David builded with turrets, whereon there hang a thousand shields, all the armour of the mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.5'>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.6'>Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.7'>Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one bead of thy necklace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.10'>How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.11'>Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey--honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.12'>A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.13'>Thy shoots are a park of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.14'>Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I sleep, but my heart waketh; Hark! my beloved knocketh: 'Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.5'>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.6'>I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had turned away, and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.8'>'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him? that I am love- sick.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.13'>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs; his lips are as lilies, dropping with flowing myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands are as rods of gold set with beryl; his body is as polished ivory overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold; his aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her happy; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Before I was aware, my soul set me upon the chariots of my princely people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulammite? As it were a dance of two companies.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.7'>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.1'>How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, the work of the hands of a skilled workman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.5'>Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said: 'I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; and let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy countenance like apples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, that glideth down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>Oh that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, and none would despise me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, that thou mightest instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.8.6'>Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very flame of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, he would utterly be contemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
