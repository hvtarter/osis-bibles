      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>THE WORD of the LORD that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When the LORD spoke at first with Hosea, the LORD said unto Hosea: 'Go, take unto thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry; for the land doth commit great harlotry, departing from the LORD.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>And the LORD said unto him: 'Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And He said unto him: 'Call her name Lo-ruhamah;    for I will no more have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have compassion upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>And He said: 'Call his name Lo-ammi;    for ye are not My people, and I will not be yours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them: 'Ye are not My people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are the children of the living God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye unto your brethren: 'Ammi';    and to your sisters, 'Ruhamah.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not My wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her harlotries from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And I will not have compassion upon her children; for they are children of harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother hath played the harlot, she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said: 'I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, and she shall seek them, but shall not find them; then shall she say: 'I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that it was I that gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will snatch away My wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her appointed seasons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said: 'These are my hire that my lovers have given me'; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, wherein she offered unto them, and decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot Me, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor    for a door of hope; and she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call Me Ishi,    and shalt call Me no more Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>And I will sow her unto Me in the land; and I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; and I will say to them that were not My people: 'Thou art My people'; and they shall say: 'Thou art my God.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>And the LORD said unto me: 'Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend and an adulteress, even as the LORD loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>and I said unto her: 'Thou shalt sit solitary for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man's wife; nor will I be thine.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall sit solitary many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall come trembling unto the LORD and to His goodness in the end of days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel! for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery! they break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore doth the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, with the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sin of My people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>And it is like people, like priest; and I will punish him for his ways, and will recompense him his doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>And they shall eat, and not have enough, they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and offer upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit harlotry, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for they themselves consort with lewd women, and they sacrifice with harlots; and the people that is without understanding is distraught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah become guilty; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth- aven, nor swear: 'As the LORD liveth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; now shall the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>When their carouse is over, they take to harlotry; her rulers deeply love dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear this, O ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; and I am rejected of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I, even I, know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings will not suffer them to return unto their God; for the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, for they have begotten strange children; now shall the new moon devour them with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; sound an alarm at Beth-aven: 'Behind thee, O Benjamin!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; because he willingly walked after filth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>And when Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Contentious; but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>'Come, and let us return unto the LORD; for He hath torn, and He will heal us, He hath smitten, and He will bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days will He revive us, on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>And let us know, eagerly strive to know the LORD, His going forth is sure as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; and thy judgment goeth forth as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they like men have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is covered with footprints of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so doth the company of priests; they murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they commit enormity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; there harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee! When I would turn the captivity of My people,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>when I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And let them not say to their heart--I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about, they are before My face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth to stir from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>On the day of our king the princes make him sick with the heat of wine, he stretcheth out his hand with scorners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; but they have not returned unto the LORD their God, nor sought Him, for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding; they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, seeing they have spoken lies against Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, though they wail upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise evil against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not upwards; they are become like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>Set the horn to thy mouth. As a vulture he cometh against the house of the LORD; because they have transgressed My covenant, and trespassed against My law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>Will they cry unto Me: 'My God, we Israel know Thee'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel hath cast off that which is good; the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not from Me, they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; Mine anger is kindled against them; how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For from Israel is even this: the craftsman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in shivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; it hath no stalk, the bud that shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up; now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no value.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath hired lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them up; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of king and princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>For Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, yea, altars have been unto him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>Though I write for him never so many things of My Law, they are accounted as a stranger's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>As for the sacrifices that are made by fire unto Me, let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, for the LORD accepteth them not. Now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces, and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Rejoice not, O Israel, unto exultation, like the peoples, for thou hast gone astray from thy God, thou hast loved a harlot's hire upon every corn-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They shall not pour out wine-offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite, it shall not come into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will ye do in the day of the appointed season, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their precious treasures of silver, nettles shall possess them, thorns shall be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad! For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Ephraim is a watchman with my God; as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season; but so soon as they came to Baal-peor, they separated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became detestable like that which they loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird; there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.12'>Yea, though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left; yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>
