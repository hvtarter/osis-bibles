        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>BOOK I HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples mutter in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against His anointed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>'Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, the Lord hath them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then will He speak unto them in His wrath, and affright them in His sore displeasure:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>'Truly it is I that have established My king upon Zion, My holy mountain.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me: 'Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise; be admonished, ye judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Do homage in purity, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way, when suddenly His wrath is kindled. Happy are all they that take refuge in Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>LORD, how many are mine adversaries become! Many are they that rise up against me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>With my voice I call unto the LORD, and He answereth me out of His holy mountain. Selah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I lay me down, and I sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I am not afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; Thy blessing be upon Thy people. Selah</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness, Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame, in that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that the LORD hath set apart the godly man as His own; the LORD will hear when I call unto Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Tremble, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!' LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than when their corn and their wine increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, LORD, makest me dwell alone in safety.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with Thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; the LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; make Thy way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open sepulchre; they make smooth their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Hold them guilty, O God, let them fall by their own counsels; cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against Thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, they shall ever shout for joy, and Thou shalt shelter them; let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For Thou dost bless the righteous; O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul also is sore affrighted; and Thou, O LORD, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; save me for Thy mercy's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For in death there is no remembrance of Thee; in the nether-world who will give Thee thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD receiveth my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.10'>All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted; they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.8'>O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.9'>Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; for the righteous God trieth the heart and reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.10'>My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.11'>God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.12'>If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.13'>He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.14'>Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.</verse>
