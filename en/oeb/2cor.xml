        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>To the church of God in Corinth, and to all Christ’s people throughout Greece, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God, and from Timothy, who is also a follower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-merciful Father, the God ever ready to console,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who consoles us in all our troubles, so that we may be able to console those who are in any trouble with the consolation that we ourselves receive from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>It is true that we have our full share of the sufferings of the Christ, but through the Christ we have also our full share of consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>If we meet with trouble, it is for the sake of your consolation and salvation; and, if we find consolation, it is for the sake of the consolation that you will experience when you are called to endure the sufferings that we ourselves are enduring;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>and our hope for you remains unshaken. We know that, as you are sharing our sufferings, you will also share our consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>We want you, friends, to know that, in the troubles which befell us in Roman Asia, we were burdened altogether beyond our strength, so much so that we even despaired of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Indeed, we had the presentiment that we must die, so that we might rely, not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>And from so imminent a death God delivered us, and will deliver us again; for in him we have placed our hopes of future deliverance, while you, also, help us by your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>And then many lips will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to many prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>Indeed, our main ground for satisfaction is this — Our conscience tells us that our conduct in the world, and still more in our relations with you, was marked by a purity of motive and a sincerity that were inspired by God, and was based, not on worldly policy, but on the help of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>We never write anything to you other than what you will acknowledge to the very end —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>And, indeed, you have already partly acknowledged it about us — that you have a right to be proud of us, as we will be proud of you, on the day of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>With this conviction in my mind, I planned to come to see you first, so that your pleasure might be doubled —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>To visit you both on my way to Macedonia, and to come to you again on my return from Macedonia, and then to get you to send me on my way into Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>As this was my plan, where, pray, did I show any fickleness of purpose? Or do you think that my plans are formed on mere impulse, so that in the same breath I say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>As God is true, the message that we brought you does not waver between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>The Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom we — Silas, Timothy, and I — proclaimed among you, never wavered between ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’ With him it has always been ‘Yes.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For, many as were the promises of God, in Christ is the ‘Yes’ that fulfills them. Therefore, through Christ again, let the ‘Amen’ rise, through us, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>God who brings us, with you, into close union with Christ, and who consecrated us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>also set his seal on us, and gave us his Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of future blessings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But, as my life will answer for it, I call God to witness that it was to spare you that I deferred my visit to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>I do not mean that we are to dictate to you with regard to your faith; on the contrary, we work with you for your true happiness; indeed, it is through your faith that you are standing firm.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>For my own sake, as well, I decided not to pay you another painful visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>If it is I who cause you pain, why, who is there to cheer me, except the person whom I am paining?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>So I wrote as I did because I was afraid that if I had come, I should have been pained by those who ought to have made me glad; for I felt sure that it was true of you all that my joy was in every case yours also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>I wrote to you in sore trouble and distress of heart and with many tears, not to give you pain, but to let you see how intense a love I have for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now whoever has caused the pain has not so much pained me, as he has, to some extent — not to be too severe — pained every one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>The man to whom I refer has been sufficiently punished by the penalty inflicted by the majority of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that now you must take the opposite course, and forgive and encourage him, or else he may be overwhelmed by the intensity of his pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>So I entreat you to assure him of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>I had this further object, also, in what I wrote — to find out whether you might be relied on to be obedient in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Anyone you forgive, I forgive them, too. Indeed, for my part, whatever I have forgiven (if I have had to forgive anything), I have forgiven for your sakes, in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>so as to prevent Satan from taking advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>When I went to the district around Troas to tell the good news of the Christ, even though there was an opening for serving the Master,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I could get no peace of mind because I failed to find Titus, my friend; so I took leave of the people there, and went on to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>All thanks to God, who, through our union with the Christ, leads us in one continual triumph, and uses us to spread the sweet perfume of the knowledge of him in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are the fragrance of Christ ascending to God — both among those who are in the path of salvation and among those who are in the path to ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To the latter we are a stench which arises from death and tells of death; to the former a fragrance which arises from life and tells of life. But who is equal to such a task?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>Unlike many people, we are not in the habit of making profit out of God’s message; but in all sincerity, and bearing God’s commission, we speak before him in union with Christ.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You yourselves are our letter — a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on ‘tablets of stone,’ but on ‘tablets of human hearts.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgment by ourselves, as if on our own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be ministers of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written law, but a Spirit. For the written law means death, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory!  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains ; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>‘Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>And the ‘Lord’ is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit.

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore, since it is by God’s mercy that we are engaged in this ministry, we do not lose heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>No, we have renounced the secrecy prompted by shame, refusing to adopt crafty ways, or to tamper with God’s message, and commending ourselves to everyone’s conscience, in the sight of God, by our exhibition of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>And, even if the good news that we bring is veiled, it is veiled only in the case of those who are on the path to ruin —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>people whose minds have been blinded by the God of this age, unbelievers as they are, so that the light from the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the incarnation of God, should not shine for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>(For it is not ourselves that we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Indeed, the same God who said ‘Out of darkness light will shine,’ has shone in on our hearts, so that we should bring out into the light the knowledge of the glory of God, seen in the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>This treasure we have in these earthen vessels, so that its all-prevailing power may be seen to come from God, and not to be our own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>Though hard pressed on every side, we are never hemmed in; through perplexed, never driven to despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>though pursued, never abandoned; though struck down, never killed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>We always bear on our bodies the marks of the death that Jesus died, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>Indeed, we who still live are continually being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life also of Jesus may be exhibited in our mortal nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>And so, while death is at work within us, life is at work within you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>But, in the same spirit of faith as that expressed in the words — ‘I believed, and therefore I spoke,’ we, also believe, and therefore speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>For we know that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with him, and will bring us, with you, into his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all this is for your sakes, so that the loving kindness of God, spreading from heart to heart, may cause yet more hearts to overflow with thanksgiving, to his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore, as I said, we do not lose heart. No, even though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>The light burden of our momentary trouble is preparing for us, in measure transcending thought, a weight of imperishable glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>we, all the while, gazing not on what is seen, but on what is unseen; for what is seen is transient, but what is unseen is imperishable.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our tent — that earthly body which is now our home — is taken down, we have a house of God’s building, a home not made by hands, imperishable, in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>Even while in our present body we sigh, longing to put over it our heavenly house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>sure that, when we have put it on, we will never be found discarnate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this ‘tent’ sigh under our burden, unwilling to take it off, yet wishing to put our heavenly body over it, so that all that is mortal may be absorbed in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>And he who has prepared us for this change is God, who has also given us his Spirit as a pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while our home is in the body, we are absent from our home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>For we guide our lives by faith, and not by what we see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>And in this confidence we would gladly leave our home in the body, and make our home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore, whether in our home or absent from our home, our one ambition is to please him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For at the court of the Christ we must all appear in our true characters, so that each may reap the results of the life which he has lived in the body, in accordance with his actions — whether good or worthless.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Therefore, because we know the fear inspired by the Lord, it is true that we are trying to win people over, but our motives are plain to God; and I hope that in your inmost hearts they are plain to you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We are not “commending ourselves” again to you, but rather are giving you cause for pride in us, so that you may have an answer ready for those who pride themselves on appearances and not on character.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For, if we were “beside ourselves,” it was in God’s service! If we are not in our senses, it is in yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>It is the love of the Christ which compels us, when we reflect that, as one died for all, therefore all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and that he died for all, so that the living should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>For ourselves, then, from this time forward, we refuse to regard anyone from the world’s standpoint. Even if we once thought of Christ from the standpoint of the world, yet now we do so no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new being! His old life has passed away; a new life has begun!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>But all this is the work of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the Ministry of Reconciliation —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>To proclaim that God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning people’s offenses against them, and that he had entrusted us with the message of this reconciliation.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>It is, then, on Christ’s behalf that we are acting as ambassadors, God, as it were, appealing to you through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf — Be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For our sake God made Christ, who was innocent of sin, one with our sinfulness, so that in him we might be made one with the righteousness of God.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>Therefore, as God’s fellow workers, we also appeal to you not to receive his loving kindness in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he says —  ‘At the time for acceptance I listened to you,And on the day of deliverance I helped you.’  Now is the time for acceptance! Now is the day of deliverance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Never do we put an obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>No, we are trying to commend ourselves under all circumstances, as God’s ministers should — in many an hour of endurance, in troubles, in hardships, in difficulties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in floggings, in imprisonments, in riots, in toils, in sleepless nights, in fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by kindliness, by holiness of spirit, by unfeigned love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>by the message of truth, and by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>amid honor and disrepute, amid slander and praise; regarded as deceivers, yet proved to be true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, yet well-known; as at death’s door, yet, see, we are living; as chastised, yet not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as saddened, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>We have been speaking freely to you, dear friends in Corinth; we have opened our heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>there is room there for you, yet there is not room, in your love, for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Can you not in return — I appeal to you as I should to children — open your hearts to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not enter into inconsistent relations with those who reject the faith. For what partnership can there be between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what has light to do with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial? Or what can those who accept the faith have in common with those who reject it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>What agreement can you be between a temple of God and idols? And we are a temple of the living God. That is what God meant when he said —  ‘I will live among them, and walk among them;And I will be their God, and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore “Come out from among the nations, and separate yourselves from them,” says the Lord,“And touch nothing impure;And I will welcome you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,”says the Lord, the Ruler of all.’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>How, tired though they were by many a trouble, their overflowing happiness, and even their deep poverty, resulted in a flood of generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>I can bear witness that to the full extent of their power, and even beyond their power, spontaneously,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>and with many an appeal to us for permission, they showed their love, and contributed their share towards the fund for their fellow Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And that, not only in the way we had expected; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and to us also, in accordance with God’s will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>And this led us beg Titus, since he had started the work for you, he should also see to the completion of this expression of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>And, remembering how you excel in everything — in faith, in teaching, in knowledge, in unfailing earnestness, and in the affection that we have awakened in you — I ask you to excel also in this expression of your love.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For, where there is willingness, a person’s gift is valued by its comparison with what they have, and not with what they do not have.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>With reference, indeed, to the Fund for your fellow Christians, it is quite superfluous for me to say anything to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>I know, of course, your willingness to help, and I am always boasting of it to the Macedonians. I tell them that you in Greece have been ready for a year past; and it was really your zeal that stimulated most of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>So my reason for sending our friends is to prevent what we said about you from proving, in this particular matter, an empty boast, and to enable you to be as well prepared as I have been saying that you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Otherwise, if any Macedonians were to come with me, and find you unprepared, we — to say nothing of you — should feel ashamed of our present confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I think it necessary to beg the friends to go to you in advance, and to complete the arrangements for the gift, which you have already promised, so that it may be ready, as a gift, before I come, and not look as if it were being given under pressure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>Remember the saying — ‘Scanty sowing, scanty harvest; plentiful sowing, plentiful harvest.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let everyone give as he has determined before hand, not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves ‘a cheerful giver.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the rendering of a public service such as this, not only relieves the needs of your fellow Christians, but also results in the offering to God of many a thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>Through the evidence afforded by the service rendered, you cause people to praise God for your fidelity to your profession of faith in the good news of the Christ, as well as for the liberality of your contributions for them and for all others.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>I implore you not to drive me to “show my boldness,” when I do come, by the confident tone which I expect to have to adopt towards some of you, who are expecting to find us influenced in our conduct by earthly motives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For, though we live an earthly life, we do not wage an earthly war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>The weapons for our warfare are not earthly, but, under God, are powerful enough to pull down strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>We are engaged in confuting arguments and pulling down every barrier raised against the knowledge of God. We are taking captive every hostile thought, to bring it into submission to the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and are fully prepared to punish every act of rebellion, when once your submission is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>You look at the outward appearance of things! Let anyone, who is confident that he belongs to Christ, reflect, for himself, again on the fact — that we belong to Christ no less than he does.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For people say “His letters are impressive and vigorous, but his personal appearance is insignificant and his speaking contemptible.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person be assured of this — that our words in our letters show us to be, when absent, just what our deeds will show us to be, when present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>We have not indeed the audacity to class or compare ourselves with some of those who indulge in self-commendation! But, when such persons measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they show a want of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>We, however, will not give way to unlimited boasting, but will confine ourselves to the limits of the sphere to which God limited us, when he permitted us to come as far as Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For it is not the case, as it would be if we were not in the habit of coming to you, that we are exceeding our bounds! Why, we were the very first to reach you with the good news of the Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>Our boasting, therefore, is not unlimited, nor does it extend to the labors of others; but our hope is that, as your faith grows, our influence among you may be very greatly increased — though still confined to our sphere —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>So that we will be able to tell the good news in the districts beyond you, without trespassing on the sphere assigned to others, or boasting of what has been already done.</verse>
