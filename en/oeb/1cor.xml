        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>To the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated by union with Christ Jesus and called to become his people, and also to all, wherever they may be, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — their Master and ours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>from Paul, who has been called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and from Sosthenes, our fellow follower of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I always thank God about you for the blessing bestowed on you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>For through union with him you were enriched in every way — in your power to preach, and in your knowledge of the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>and so became yourselves a confirmation of my testimony to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>There is no gift in which you are deficient, while waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>And God himself will strengthen you to the end, so that at the day of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God will not fail you, and it is he who called you into communion with his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>But I appeal to you, my friends, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree in what you profess, and not to allow divisions to exist among you, but to be united — of one mind and of one opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For I have been informed, my friends, by the members of Chloe’s household, that party feeling exists among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>I mean this: that every one of you says either ‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I Apollos,’ or ‘I Cephas,’ or ‘I Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>You have torn the Christ in pieces! Was it Paul who was crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the faith of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that no one can say that you were baptized into my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I baptized also the household of Stephanas. I do not know that I baptized anyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>My mission from Christ was not to baptize, but to tell the good news; not, however, in the language of philosophy, in case the cross of the Christ should be robbed of its meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>The message of the cross is indeed mere folly to those who are in the path to ruin, but to us who are in the path of salvation it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For scripture says —  ‘I will bring the philosophy of the philosophers to nought, and the shrewdness of the shrewd I will bring to nothing.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the philosopher? Where the teacher of the law? Where the disputant of today? Has not God shown the world’s philosophy to be folly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since the world, in God’s wisdom, did not by its philosophy learn to know God, God saw fit, by the ‘folly’ of our proclamation, to save those who believe in Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>While Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks study philosophy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>we are proclaiming Christ crucified! — to the Jews an obstacle, to the Gentiles mere folly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who have received the call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For God’s ‘folly’ is wiser than people, and God’s ‘weakness’ is stronger than people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>Look at the facts of your call, friends. There are not many among you who are wise, as people reckon wisdom, not many who are influential, not many who are high-born;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God chose what the world counts foolish to put its wise to shame, and God chose what the world counts weak to put its strong to shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and God chose what the world counts poor and insignificant — things that to it are unreal — to bring its ‘realities’ to nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that in his presence no one should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But you, by your union with Christ Jesus, belong to God; and Christ, by God’s will, became not only our wisdom, but also our righteousness, holiness, and deliverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that — in the words of scripture —  ‘Let him who boasts make his boast of the Lord!’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>For my own part, friends, when I came to you, it was with no display of eloquence or philosophy that I came to tell the hidden purpose of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>for I had determined that, while with you, I would forget everything Jesus Christ — and him crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>Indeed, when I came among you, I was weak, and full of fears, and in great anxiety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My message and my proclamation were not delivered in the persuasive language of philosophy, but were accompanied by the manifestation of spiritual power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>so that your faith should be based, not on the human wisdom, but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Yet there is a philosophy that we teach to those whose faith is matured, but it is not the philosophy of today, or of the leaders of today — whose downfall is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>No, it is a divine philosophy that we teach, one concerned with the hidden purpose of God — that long hidden philosophy which God, before time began, destined for our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>This philosophy is not known to any of the leaders of today; for, had they known it, they would not have crucified our glorified Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>It is what scripture speaks of as —  ‘What eye never saw, nor ear ever heard,what never entered people's minds —even all that God has prepared for those who love him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>Yet to us God revealed it through his Spirit; for the Spirit fathoms all things, even the inmost depths of God’s being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what person is there who knows what a person is, except the person’s own spirit within them? So, also, no one comprehends what God is, except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>And as for us, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit that comes from God, so that we may realize the blessings given to us by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>And we speak of these gifts, not in language taught by human philosophy, but in language taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>The merely intellectual person rejects the teaching of the Spirit of God; for to them it is mere folly; they cannot grasp it, because it is to be understood only by spiritual insight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the person with spiritual insight is able to understand everything, although they themselves are understood by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For ‘who has so comprehended the mind of the Lord as to be able to instruct him?’ We, however, have the mind of Christ.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded — mere infants in the faith of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ are not you like other people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s harvest field, God’s building.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid — Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the quality of each man’s work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man’s work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone’s work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone’s work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do not you know that you are God’s Temple, and that God’s Spirit has his home in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, let them become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For in God’s sight this world’s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of —  ‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And it says again —  ‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours —</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future — all things are yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>But you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let people look on us as Christ’s servants, and as stewards of the hidden truths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now what we look for in stewards is that they should be trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But it weighs very little with me that I am judged by you or by any human tribunal. No, I do not even judge myself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>for, though I am conscious of nothing against myself, that does not prove me innocent. It is the Lord who is my judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore do not pass judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes. He will throw light on what is now dark and obscure, and will reveal the motives in people’s minds; and then everyone will receive due praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>All this, friends, I have, for your sakes, applied to Apollos and myself, so that, from our example, you may learn to observe the precept — ‘Keep to what is written,’ that none of you may speak boastfully of one teacher to the disparagement of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes any one of you superior to others? And what have you that was not given you? But if you received it as a gift, why do you boast as if you had not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Are you all so soon satisfied? Are you so soon rich? Have you begun to reign without us? Would indeed that you had, so that we also might reign with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For, as it seems to me, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of all, as people doomed to death. We are made a spectacle to the universe, both to angels and to people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We, for Christ’s sake, are ‘fools,’ but you, by your union with Christ, are people of discernment. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To this very hour we go hungry, thirsty, and naked; we are beaten; we are homeless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>we work hard, toiling with our own hands. We meet abuse with blessings, we meet persecution with endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>we meet slander with gentle appeals. We have been treated as the scum of the earth, the vilest of the vile, to this very hour.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>It is with no wish to shame you that I am writing like this; but to warn you as my own dear children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>Though you may have thousands of instructors in the faith of Christ, yet you have not many fathers. It was I who, through union with Christ Jesus, became your father by means of the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I entreat you — Follow my example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>This is my reason for sending Timothy to you. He is my own dear faithful child in the Master’s service, and he will remind you of my methods of teaching the faith of Christ Jesus — methods which I follow everywhere in every church.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Some, I hear, are puffed up with pride, thinking that I am not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord; and then I will find out, not what words these people use who are so puffed up, but what power they possess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>for the kingdom of God is based, not on words, but on power.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles — a man, I hear, is living with his father’s wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>I have decided — having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us —</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is unseemly. Do not you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough — free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed — Christ himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people —</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping — no, not even to sit down to eat with such people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>while God judges those who are outside? ‘Put away the wicked from among you.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ’s people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do not you know that Christ’s people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do not you know that we are to try angels — to say nothing of the affairs of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves — yes, even other followers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do not you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God’s kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God’s kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ’s people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do not you know that your bodies are Christ’s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or do not you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Again, do not you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>With reference to the subjects about which you wrote to me: It is good for a man to remain single.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But, owing to the prevalence of immorality, I advise every man to have his own wife, and every woman her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>A husband should give his wife her due, and a wife her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>It is not the wife, but the husband, who exercises power over her body; and so, too, it is not the husband, but the wife, who exercises power over his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive each other of what is due — unless it is only for a time and by mutual consent, so that your minds may be free for prayer until you again live as man and wife — otherwise Satan might take advantage of your want of self-control and tempt you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I should wish everyone to be just what I am myself. But everyone has his own gift from God — one in one way, and one in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>My advice, then, to those who are not married, and to widows, is this: It would be good for them to remain as I am myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But, if they cannot control themselves, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To those who are married my direction is — yet it is not mine, but the Master’s — that a woman is not to leave her husband</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>(If she has done so, let her remain as she is, or else be reconciled to her husband) and also that a man is not to divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>To all others I say — I, not the Master — If a follower of the Lord is married to a woman, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with him, he should not divorce her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>and a woman who is married to a man, who is an unbeliever but willing to live with her, should not divorce her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For, through his wife, the husband who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people; and the wife who is an unbeliever has become associated with Christ’s people through the Lord's follower whom she has married. Otherwise your children would be ‘defiled,’ but, as it is, they belong to Christ’s people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>However, if the unbeliever wishes to be separated, let him be so. Under such circumstances neither is bound; God has called you to live in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>How can you tell, wife, whether you may not save your husband? And how can you tell, husband, whether you may not save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>In any case, a person should continue to live in the condition which the Lord has allotted to them, and in which they were when God called them. This is the rule that I lay down in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was a man already circumcised when he was called? Then he should not efface his circumcision. Has a man been called when uncircumcised? Then he should not be circumcised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. No, even if you are able to gain your freedom, still do your best.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For the person who was a slave when they were called to the master’s service is the Master’s freedman; so, too, the person who was free when called is Christ’s slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought, and the price was paid. Do not let yourselves become slaves to people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if some one should see you who possess this knowledge, feasting in an idol’s temple, will not their conscience, if they are weak, become so hardened that they, too, will eat food offered to idols?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>The person who, when speaking, uses the gift of ‘tongues’ is speaking, not to people, but to God, for no one understands them; yet in spirit they are speaking of hidden truths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But those who preach are speaking to their fellow men and women words that will build up faith, and give them comfort and encouragement.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I want you all to speak in ‘tongues,’ but much more I wish that you should preach. A preacher is worth more than one who speaks in ‘tongues,’ unless they interprets their words, so that the faith of the church may be built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>This being so, friends, what good will I do you, if I come to you and speak in ‘tongues,’ unless my words convey some revelation, or knowledge, or take the form of preaching or teaching?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>If you bless God with your spirit only, how can people in the congregation who are without your gift say ‘Amen’ to your thanksgiving? They do not know what you are saying!</verse>
