        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon’s house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ’s People have been cheered, friend, by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you — yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>and I am sending him back to you with this letter — though it is like tearing out of my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but as something better — a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, put my own hand to it — I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.</verse>
