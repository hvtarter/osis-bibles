        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>It is said in the prophet Isaiah —  ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you;he will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:“Prepare the road for the Lord,make a straight path for him.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John wore clothes made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>and he proclaimed — “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and from the heavens came a voice — “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Immediately afterwards the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the Sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>They left their nets at once, and followed him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked the spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other: “What is this? What is this strange teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole neighborhood of Galilee.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went, with James and John, into the house of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole city was gathered around the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus rose and went out, and, going to a lonely spot, there began to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>But Simon and his companions went out searching for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and, when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>But Jesus said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went about making his proclamation in their Synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction.

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>Some days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was in a house there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and so many people collected together, that after a while there was no room for them even around the door; and he began to tell them his message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Some people came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, who was being carried by four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>Being, however, unable to get him near to Jesus, owing to the crowd, they removed the roofing above Jesus; and, when they had made an opening, they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But some of the teachers of the law who were sitting there were debating in their minds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus, at once intuitively aware that they were debating with themselves in this way, said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>— here he said to the paralyzed man —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>The man got up, and immediately took up his mat, and went out before them all; at which they were amazed, and, as they praised God, they said: “We have never seen anything like this!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Jesus went out again to the Sea; and all the people came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax office, and said to him: Levi got up and followed him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Later on he was in his house having dinner, and a number of tax-gatherers and outcasts took their places at the table with Jesus and his disciples; for many of them were following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>When the teachers of the law belonging to the party of the Pharisees saw that he was eating in the company of such people, they said to his disciples: “He is eating in the company of tax-gatherers and outcasts!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Hearing this, Jesus said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and people came and asked Jesus: “Why is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, while yours do not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]

        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>One Sabbath, as Jesus was walking through the cornfields, his disciples began to pick the ears of wheat as they went along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>“Look!” the Pharisees said to him, “why are they doing what is not allowed on the Sabbath?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>Then Jesus added:</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>Jesus said to the man with the withered hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>and to the people he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man: The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the Sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out: “You are the Son of God”!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve — whom he also named ‘apostles’ — so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and with power to drive out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>So he appointed the Twelve — Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his relations heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The teachers of the law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said: “He has Beelzebul in him! He he drives the demons out by the help of their chief.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him: “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>was his reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said:</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Jesus again began to teach by the Sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the Sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water’s edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them:  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And Jesus said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>Afterwards, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>and he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>he went on;</verse>

        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>Jesus said to them:</verse>

        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>Jesus also said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>Jesus also said:</verse>

        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried: “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>he exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another: “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the Sea — the country of the Gerasenes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>shrieking out in a loud voice: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God’s sake do not torment me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For Jesus had said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him: “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and the spirits begged Jesus: “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove — about two thousand in number — rushed down the steep slope into the Sea and were drowned in the Sea.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him — and they were awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>so they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighborhood.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus refused. he said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not he the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters, too, living here among us?” This proved a hindrance to their believing in him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could not work any miracle there, beyond placing his hands on a few infirm persons, and curing them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>and he wondered at the want of faith shown by the people. Jesus went around the villages, one after another, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He called the Twelve to him, and began to send them out as his messengers, two and two, and gave them authority over foul spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey — not even bread, or a bag, or coins in their purse;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>As soon as it was daylight, the chief priests, after holding a consultation with the councillors and teachers of the law — that is to say, the whole High Council — put Jesus in chains, and took him away, and gave him up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>Then the chief priests brought a number of charges against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>So Pilate questioned Jesus again. “Have you no reply to make?” he asked. “Listen, how many charges they are bringing against you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus still made no reply whatever; at which Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now, at the feast, Pilate used to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might ask for.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>So, when the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate to follow his usual custom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>he answered: “Do you want me to release the ‘king of the Jews’ for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he was aware that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had given Jesus up to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they kept striking him on the head with a rod, spitting at him, and bowing to the ground before him — going down on their knees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the purple robe, and put his own clothes on him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>They brought Jesus to the place which was known as Golgotha — a name which means ‘place of a Skull.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>There they offered him drugged wine; but Jesus refused it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way the chief priests, with the teachers of the law, said to one another in mockery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Christ, the ‘king of Israel,’ come down from the cross now so that we can see it and believe.” Even the men who had been crucified with Jesus insulted him.
