        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>To his Excellency, Theophilus. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] Many attempts have been already made to draw up an because of those events which have reached their conclusion among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterwards became bearers of the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, ‘to reconcile fathers to their children’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>“I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>“The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: “You have been shown great favor - the Lord is with you..”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>when the angel spoke again: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>“How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>“The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>“I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary; “let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and there she went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and cried aloud: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said:  “My soul exalts the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>my spirit delights in God my Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>for he has remembered his humble servant girl;And from this hour all ages will count me happy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Great things has the Almighty done for me;And holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>From age to age his mercy restsOn those who honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>Mighty are the deeds of his arm;He scatters the proud with their own devices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>he casts down princes from their thrones,and the humble he uplifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>the hungry he loads with gifts,and the rich he sends empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,Ever mindful of his mercy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(As he promised to our forefathers)For Abraham and his race for ever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>When Elizabeth’s time came, she gave birth to a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him ‘Zechariah’ after his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>when his mother spoke up: “No, he is to be called John.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>“You have no relation of that name!” they exclaimed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>and they made signs to the child’s father, to find out what he wished the child to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words — ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another — “What can this child be destined to become?” For the Power of the Lord was with him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>“Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,Who has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up for us the Strength of our salvationIn the house of his servant David —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>showing mercy to our forefathers,And mindful of his sacred covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>This was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>and should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,In his presence all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,For you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give his people the knowledge of salvationIn the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God,Whereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,And guide our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And everyone went to his own town to be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea — because he belonged to the family and house of David —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>To be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there her time came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>“Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>“glory to God on high,And on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another: “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus — the name given him by the angel before his conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>in compliance with the law of the Lord that ‘every first-born male will be dedicated to the Lord,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And also to offer the sacrifice required by the law of the Lord — ‘a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>“Now, Lord, you will let your servant go,According to your word, in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen the salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which you have prepared in the sight of all nations —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light to bring light to the Gentiles,And to be the glory of your people Israel.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>While the child’s father and mother were wondering at what was said about him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child’s mother: “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart — and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>There was also a Prophetess named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>When the child’s parents had done everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Every year the child’s parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day’s journey before searching for him among their relations and acquaintances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All who listened to him marveled at his intelligence and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him: “My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>His parents did not understand what he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and ‘gained the blessing of God and people.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah —  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:“Make ready the way of the Lord,Make his paths straight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>The chief priest and the teachers of the law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Then he said to them all: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “No; nothing,” they answered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And, when he reached the spot, he said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>Then he withdrew about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>he asked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>on which Jesus said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed: “Master, should we use our swords?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>on which Jesus said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and councillors, who had come for him, he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said: “Why, this man was one of his companions!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>A little while afterwards some one else — a man — saw him and said: “Why, you are one of them!” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “No,” Peter said, “I am not.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour later another man declared positively: “This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said: “I do not know what you are speaking about.” Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>and he went outside and wept bitterly.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said; “who was it that struck you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they heaped many other insults on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>At daybreak the National Council met — both the chief priests and the teachers of the law — and took Jesus before their High Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>“If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]replied Jesus,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then they all rose in a body and led Jesus before Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him: “This is a man whom we found misleading our people, preventing them from paying taxes to the Emperor, and giving out that he himself is ‘Christ, a king.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>“Are you the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked him. replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>But Pilate, turning to the chief priests and the people, said: “I do not see anything to find fault with in this man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they insisted: “He is stirring up the people by his teaching all through Judea; he began with Galilee and has now come here.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>Hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>and, having satisfied himself that Jesus came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was at Jerusalem at the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly pleased, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, having heard a great deal about him; and he was hoping to see some sign given by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>So he questioned him at some length, but Jesus made no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Meanwhile the chief priests and the teachers of the law stood by and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod, with his soldiers, treated Jesus with scorn; he mocked him by throwing a gorgeous robe around him, and then sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, for before that there had been ill-will between them.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>So Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the leading men, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them: “You brought this man before me charged with misleading the people; and yet, for my part, though I examined him before you, I did not find this man to blame for any of the things of which you accuse him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>nor did Herod either; for he has sent him back to us. And, as a fact, he has not done anything deserving death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>so I will have him scourged, and then release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they began to shout as one man: “Kill this fellow, but release Barabbas for us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(Barabbas was a man who had been put in prison for a riot that had broken out in the city and for murder.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, however, wanting to release Jesus, called to them again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they kept calling out: “Crucify, crucify him!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>“Why, what harm has this man done?” Pilate said to them for the third time. “I have found nothing in him for which he could be condemned to death. So I will have him scourged, and then release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they persisted in loudly demanding his crucifixion; and their clamor gained the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He released the man who had been put in prison for riot and murder, as they demanded, and gave Jesus up to be dealt with as they pleased.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And, as they were leading Jesus away, they laid hold of Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on his shoulders, for him to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>There was a great crowd of people following him, many being women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>So Jesus turned and said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>There were two others also, criminals, led out to be executed with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they had reached the place called ‘The Skull,’ there they crucified Jesus and the criminals, one on the right, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then Jesus said: His clothes they divided among them by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>Meanwhile the people stood looking on. Even the leading men said with a sneer: “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is God’s Christ, his chosen one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers, too, came up in mockery, bringing him common wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying as they did so: “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>Above him were the words —  ‘THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the criminals who were hanging beside Jesus railed at him. “Are not you the Christ? Save yourself and us,” he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other rebuked him. “Have not you,” he said, “any fear of God, now that you are under the same sentence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we justly so, for we are only reaping our deserts, but this man has not done anything wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Jesus,” he went on, “do not forget me when you have come to your kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was nearly midday, when a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>the sun being eclipsed; and the Temple curtain was torn down the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Then Jesus, with a loud cry, said: And with these words he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>The Roman captain, on seeing what had happened, praised God, exclaiming: “This must have been a good man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>All the people who had collected to see the sight watched what occurred, and then went home beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>All the friends of Jesus had been standing at a distance, with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, watching all this.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now there was a man of the name of Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and who bore a good and upright character.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(This man had not assented to the decision and action of the Council.) He belonged to Ramah, a town in Judea, and lived in expectation of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>He now went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>and, when he had taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen sheet, and laid him in a tomb cut out of stone, in which no one had yet been buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the Preparation day, and just before the Sabbath began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb and how the body of Jesus was laid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>and then went home, and prepared spices and perfumes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, taking with them the spices that they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and, on going into it, they could not find the body .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them: “Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>Remember how he spoke to you before he left Galilee —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered the words of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus: “Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterwards crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said; but they did not see Jesus.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then Jesus said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>“How our hearts glowed,” the disciples said to each other, “while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognized Jesus at the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>but Jesus said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>They handed him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>They returned to Jerusalem full of joy;</verse>
