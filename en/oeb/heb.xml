        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who, of old, at many times and in many ways, spoke to our ancestors, by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these latter days spoken to us by the Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>For he is the radiance of the glory of God and the expression of his being, upholding all creation by the power of his word; and, when he had made an expiation for the sins of humanity, he ‘took his seat at the right hand’ of God’s Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having shown himself as much greater than the angels as the name that he has inherited surpasses theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did God ever say —  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’?  or again —  ‘I will be to him a Father, and he will be to me a Son’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when God brought the first-born into the world, he said —  ‘Let all the angels of God bow down before him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Speaking of the angels, he said —  ‘He makes the winds his angelsAnd the flames of fire his servants’;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>while of the Son he said —  ‘God is your throne for ever and ever;The scepter of his kingdom is the scepter of Justice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You love righteousness and hates iniquity;Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the festal oil more abundantly than your peers.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>Again —  ‘You, Lord, in the beginning did lay the foundation of the earth,And the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They will perish, but you remain;As a garment they will all grow old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>As a mantle you will fold them up,And as a garment they will be changed,But you are the same, and your years will know no end.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which of the angels has God ever said —  ‘Sit you at my right handUntil I put your enemies as a stool for your feet’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are not all the angels spirits in the service of God, sent out to minister for the sake of those who are destined to obtain salvation?  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offense against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>No; a writer has declared somewhere —  ‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them?Or human beings that you should care for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You have made them, for a while, lower than angels;With glory and honor you have crowned them;You have set them over all that your hands have made;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You have placed all things beneath their feet.’  This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honor; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God’s loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>He says —  ‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters,In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again —  ‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’  And yet again —  ‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of ‘the children,’ Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death — that is, the devil —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but ‘to the help of the descendants of Abraham.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like ‘his brothers and sisters,’ in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity’s relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house — if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says —  ‘If today you hear God’s voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked meOn the day when they tried my patience in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your ancestors tried my forbearance,And saw my mighty deeds for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation,And I said — “Their hearts are always straying;They have never learned my ways”;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>While in my wrath I swore —“They will never enter upon my rest.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>Rather encourage one another daily — while there is a ‘Today’ — to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>To use the words of scripture —  ‘If today you hear God’s voice,Harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we will enter upon God’s rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For we have had the good news told us just as they had. But the message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>Upon that rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said —  ‘In my wrath I swore —“They will never enter upon my rest;”’  Although God’s work was finished at the creation of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words —  ‘God rested on the seventh day after all his work.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>On the other hand, we read in that passage —  ‘They will never enter upon my rest.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since, then, there is still a promise that some will enter upon this rest, and since those who were first told the good news did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again God fixed a day. ‘Today,’ he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted —  ‘If today you hear God’s voiceHarden not your hearts.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>Now if Joshua had given ‘rest’ to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There is, then, a Sabbath rest still awaiting God’s people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For the person who enters upon God’s rest do themselves rest after their work, just as God did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>God’s message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way until it penetrates soul and spirit — not the joints only but the marrow — and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>We have, then , in Jesus, the Son of God, a great high priest who has passed into the highest heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the faith which we have professed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>Our high priest is not one unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the throne of love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>Every high priest, taken from among the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>And he is able to sympathize with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honor of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him —  ‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>and on another occasion also —  ‘You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need some one to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with ‘milk’ instead of with ‘solid food.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who still has to take ‘milk’ knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But ‘solid food’ is for Christians of mature faith — those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>Yes and, with God’s help, we will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learned to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and learned to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but, if it ‘bears thorns and thistles,’ it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being ‘cursed,’ and its end will be the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things — of things that point to your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians — as you are still doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God’s promises.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>His words were —  ‘I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfillment of God’s promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false — we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it ‘reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the law — that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God’s promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood — and it was under this priesthood that the people received the law — why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>With the change of the priesthood a change of the law became a necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>and that he was appointed, not under a law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>for that is the meaning of the declaration —  ‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him —  ‘The Lord has sworn, and will not change, “You are a priest for all time.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>This was the high priest that we needed — holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>The law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God’s oath, which was later than the law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>To sum up what I have been saying: — Such is the high priest that we have, one who ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God’s Majesty in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>where he ministers in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the law directs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>But, finding fault with the people, God says —  ‘“A time is coming,” says the Lord,“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestorsOn the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.For they did not abide by their covenant with me,And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>“This is the covenant that I will make with the people of IsraelAfter those days,” says the Lord.“I will impress my laws on their minds,And will inscribe them on their hearts;And I will be their God,And they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen,Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’;For everyone will know me,From the lowest to the highest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings,And I will no longer remember their sins.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>By speaking of a ‘new’ covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>It is true that even the first covenant had its regulations for divine worship, and its sanctuary — though only a material one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was constructed, with an outer part which contained the stand for the lamps, and the table, and the consecrated bread. This is called the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>The part of the tent behind the second curtain is called the inner sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>In it is the gold incense-altar, and the ark containing the covenant, completely covered with gold. In the ark is a gold casket containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets on which the covenant was written;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>while above it, and overshadowing the cover on which atonement was made, are the cherubim of the presence. Now is not the time to discuss these things in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Such, then, was the arrangement of the tent. Into the outer part priests are constantly going, in the discharge of their sacred duties;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the inner only the high priest goes, and that but once a year, and never without taking the blood of a victim, which he offers on his own behalf, and on behalf of the errors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>By this the Holy Spirit is teaching that the way into the sanctuary was hidden, as long as the outer part of the tent still remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>For that was only a type, to continue down to the present time; and, in keeping with it, both gifts and sacrifices are offered, though incapable of satisfying the conscience of the worshiper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>the whole system being concerned only with food and drink and various ablutions — external ceremonials imposed until the coming of the new order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But, when Christ came, he appeared as high priest of that better system which was established; and he entered through that nobler and more perfect ‘tent,’ not made by human hands — that is to say, not a part of this present creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Nor was it with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, that he entered, once and for all, into the sanctuary, and obtained our eternal deliverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For, if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, purify those who have been defiled (as far as ceremonial purification goes),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through his eternal Spirit, offered himself up to God, as a victim without blemish, purify our consciences from a lifeless formality, and fit us for the service of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And that is why he is the intermediary of a new covenant; in order that, as a death has taken place to effect a deliverance from the offenses committed under the first covenant, those who have received the call may obtain the eternal inheritance promised to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>Whenever such a covenant as a will is in question, the death of the testator must of necessity be alleged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For such a covenant takes effect only on death, it does not come into force as long as the testator is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>This explains why even the first covenant was not ratified without the shedding of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For, when every command had been announced to all the people by Moses in accordance with the law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats, with water, scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, and sprinkled even the book of the law, as well as all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, as he did so — “This is the blood that renders valid the covenant which God has commanded to be made with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And in the same way he also sprinkled with the blood the tent and all the things that were used in public worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Indeed, under the law, almost everything is purified with blood; and, unless blood is shed, no forgiveness is to be obtained.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>While, then, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly realities to be purified by such means as these, the heavenly realities themselves required better sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For it was not into a sanctuary made by human hands, which merely foreshadowed the true one, that Christ entered, but into heaven itself, so that he might now appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor yet was it to offer himself may times, as year after year the high priest entered the sanctuary with an offering of blood — but not his own blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>for then Christ would have had to undergo death many times since the creation of the world. But now, once and for all, at the close of the age, he has appeared, in order to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And, as it is ordained for people to die but once (death being followed by judgment),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so it is with the Christ. He was offered up once and for all, to ‘bear away the sins of many’; and the second time he will appear — but without any burden of sin — to those who are waiting for him, to bring salvation.

      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>The law, though able to foreshadow the better system which was coming, never had its actual substance. Its priests, with those sacrifices which they offer continuously year after year, can never make those who come to worship perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise, would not the offering of these sacrifices have been abandoned, as the worshipers, having been once purified, would have had their consciences clear from sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But, on the contrary, these sacrifices recall their sins to mind year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to remove sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>That is why, when he was coming into the world, the Christ declared —  ‘Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you provide for me a body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>You take no pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>So I said, “See, I have come’ (as is written of me in the pages of the book),“To do your will, God.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>First come the words — ‘You do not desire, nor do you take pleasure in, sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin’ (offerings regularly made under the law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>and then there is added — ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ The former sacrifices are set aside to be replaced by the latter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>And it is in the fulfillment of the will of God that we have been purified by the sacrifice, once and for all, of the body of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>Every other priest stands day after day at his ministrations, and offers the same sacrifices over and over again — sacrifices that can never take sins away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But, this priest, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, which should serve for all time, ‘took his seat at the right hand of God,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>and has since then been waiting ‘for his enemies to be put as a stool for his feet.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>By a single offering he has made perfect for all time those who are being purified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>We have also the testimony of the Holy Spirit. For, after saying —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>‘“This is the covenant that I will make with themAfter those days,” says the Lord;“I will impress my laws on their hearts,And will inscribe them on their minds,”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>then we have —  ‘And their sins and their iniquities I will no longer remember.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>And, when these are forgiven, there is no further need of an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, friends, since we may enter the sanctuary with confidence, in virtue of the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the way which he inaugurated for us — a new and living way, a way through the sanctuary curtain (that is, his human nature);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and, since we have in him ‘a great priest set over the house of God,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near to God in all sincerity of heart and in perfect faith, with our hearts purified by the sprinkled blood from all consciousness of wrong, and with our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us maintain the confession of our hope unshaken, for he who has given us his promise will not fail us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>Let us vie with one another in a rivalry of love and noble actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>And let us not, as some do, cease to meet together; but, on the contrary, let us encourage one another, and all the more, now that you see the day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>Remember, if we sin willfully after we have gained a full knowledge of the truth, there can be no further sacrifice for sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>there is only a fearful anticipation of judgment, and a burning indignation which will destroy all opponents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>When someone disregarded the law of Moses, they were, on the evidence of two or three witnesses, put to death without pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much worse then, think you, will be the punishment deserved by those who have trampled underfoot the Son of God, who have treated the blood that rendered the covenant valid — the blood by which they were purified — as if it were not holy, and who have outraged the Spirit of love?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>We know who it was that said —  ‘It is for me to avenge, I will requite’;  and again —  ‘The Lord will judge his people.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>Call to mind those early days in which, after you had received the light, you patiently underwent a long and painful conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>Sometimes, in consequence of the taunts and injuries heaped on you, you became a public spectacle; and sometimes you suffered through having shown yourselves to be the friends of people who were in the same position in which you had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you not only sympathised with those who were in prison, but you even took the confiscation of your possessions joyfully, knowing, as you did, that you had in yourselves a greater possession and a lasting one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.20'>for they could not bear to think of the command — ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.21'>and so fearful was the sight that Moses said — ‘I tremble with fear.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.22'>No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.23'>to the festal gathering and assemblage of God’s firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.24'>to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.25'>Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.26'>Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is —  ‘Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken — that is, of all created things — in order that only what is unshaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.29'>For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.13'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.1'>Let your love for the Lord's followers continue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.2'>Do not neglect to show hospitality; for, through being hospitable, people have all unawares entertained angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.3'>Remember the prisoners, as if you were their fellow prisoners, and the oppressed, not forgetting that you also are still in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.4'>Let marriage be honored by all and the married life be pure; for God will judge those who are immoral and those who commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.5'>Do not let your conduct be ruled by the love of money. Be content with what you have, for God himself has said —  ‘I will never forsake you, nor will I ever abandon you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.6'>Therefore we may say with confidence —  ‘The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.What can mere people do to me?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.7'>Do not forget your leaders, who told you God’s message. Recall the close of their lives, and imitate their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.8'>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today — yes, and for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Do not let yourselves be carried away by the various novel forms of teaching. It is better to rely for spiritual strength on the divine help, than on regulations regarding food; for those whose lives are guided by such regulations have not found them of service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We are not without an altar; but it is one at which those who still worship in the tent have no right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>The bodies of those animals whose blood is brought by the high priest into the sanctuary, as an offering for sin, are burnt outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>And so Jesus, also, to purify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Therefore let us go out to him ‘outside the camp,’ bearing the same reproaches as he;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>for here we have no permanent city, but are looking for the city that is to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>Through him let us offer, as our sacrifice, continual praise to God — an offering from lips that glorify his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>Never forget to do kindly acts and to share what you have with others, for such sacrifices are acceptable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Obey your leaders, and submit to their control, for they are watching over your souls, since they will have to render an account, so that they may do it with joy, and not in sorrow. That would not be to your advantage.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us, for we are sure that our consciences are clear, since our wish is to be occupied with what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>And I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, so that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>May God, the source of all peace, who brought back from the dead him who, ‘by virtue of the blood that rendered valid the unchangeable covenant, is the great shepherd of God’s Sheep,’ Jesus, our Lord —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>may God make you perfect in everything that is good, so that you may be able to do his will. May he bring out in us all that is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory for ever and ever. Amen.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
