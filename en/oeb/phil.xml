        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>To all Christ’s people at Philippi, with the presiding officers and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always, in every prayer that I offer for you all — my prayers are full of joy —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart — you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And what I pray for is this — that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ’s sake that I am in chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God’s message fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, ‘all this will make for my salvation.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>for to me life is Christ, and death is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But what if the life here in the body — if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation — a sign from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>I entreat you to make my happiness complete — Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Nothing should be done in a factious spirit or from vanity, but each of you should with all humility regard others as better than himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>and one and all should consider, not only their own interests, but also the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look on equality with God as above all things to be clung to,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like one of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death — to death on a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the name which stands above all other names,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>so that in adoration of the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD — to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent — ‘faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation,’ in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>offering to them the message of life; and then I will be able at the day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my lifeblood must be poured out in addition, still I will rejoice and share the joy of you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>and you must also rejoice and share my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one but him to send — no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself will follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my dear friend, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such people in great honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>For it was owing to his devotion to the Master’s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>In conclusion, my friends, all joy be yours in your union with the Lord. To repeat what I have already written does not weary me, and is the safe course for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of those ‘dogs’! Beware of those mischievous workers! Beware of the men who mutilate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For it is we who are the circumcised — we whose worship is prompted by the Spirit of God, who exult in Christ Jesus, and who do not rely on external privileges;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I, if anyone, have cause to rely even on them. If anyone thinks he can rely on external privileges, far more can I!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>I was circumcised when eight days old; I am an Israelite by race, and of the tribe of Benjamin; I am a Hebrew, and the child of Hebrews. As to the law, I was a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as to such righteousness as is due to law, I proved myself blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But all the things which I once held to be gains I have now, for the Christ’s sake, come to count as loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>More than that, I count everything as loss, for the sake of the exceeding value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. And for his sake I have lost everything, and count it as refuse, if I may but gain Christ and be found in union with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>any righteousness that I have being, not the righteousness that results from law, but the righteousness which comes through faith in Christ — the righteousness which is derived from God and is founded on faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>Then indeed I will know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and all that it means to share his sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>in the hope that, if I become like him in death, I may possibly attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already laid hold of it, or that I am already made perfect. But I press on, in the hope of actually laying hold of that for which indeed I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>For I, friends, do not regard myself as having yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do — forgetting what lies behind, and straining every nerve for that which lies in front,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on to the goal, to gain the prize of that heavenward call which God gave me through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let all of us, then, whose faith is mature, think this way. Then, if on any matter you think otherwise, God will make that also plain to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Only we are bound to order our lives by what we have already attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>My friends, unite in following my example, and fix your eyes on those who are living by the pattern which we have set you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For there are many — of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears — who are living in enmity to the cross of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>The end of such people is ruin; for their appetites are their God, and they glory in their shame; their minds are given up to earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>But the State of which we are citizens is in heaven; and it is from heaven that we are eagerly looking for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who, by the exercise of his power to bring everything into subjection to himself, will make this body that we have in our humiliation like to that body which he has in his glory.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So then, my dear friends, whom I am longing to see — you who are my joy and my crown, stand fast in union with the Lord, dear friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I entreat Euodia, and I entreat Syntyche, to live in harmony, in union with the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>yes, and I ask you, my true comrade, to help them, remembering that they toiled by my side in spreading the good news; and so, too, did Clement and my other fellow workers, whose names are ‘in the book of life.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>All joy be yours at all times in your union with the Lord. Again I repeat — All joy be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your forbearing spirit be plain to everyone. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Do not be anxious about anything; but under all circumstances, by prayer and entreaty joined with thanksgiving, make your needs known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>Then the peace of God, which is beyond all human understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and thoughts, through your union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>In conclusion, friends, whenever you find things that are true or honorable, righteous or pure, lovable or praiseworthy, or if ‘virtue’ and ‘honor’ have any meaning, let them fill your thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>All that you learned and received and heard and saw in me put into practice continually; and then God, the giver of peace, will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>It was a matter of great joy to me, as one in union with the Lord, that at length your interest in me had revived. The interest indeed you had, but not the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Do not think that I am saying this under the pressure of want. For I, however I am placed, have learned to be independent of circumstances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to face humble circumstances, and I know how to face prosperity. Into all and every human experience I have been initiated — into plenty and hunger, into prosperity and want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do everything in the strength of him who makes me strong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Yet you have acted nobly in sharing my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>And you at Philippi know, as well as I, that in the early days of the good news — at the time when I had just left Macedonia — no church, with the one exception of yourselves, had anything to do with me as far as giving and receiving are concerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>Indeed, even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent more than once to relieve my wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>It is not that I am anxious for your gifts, but I am anxious to see the abundant return that will be placed to your account. I have enough of everything, and to spare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>My wants are fully satisfied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts which you sent me — the sweet fragrance of a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God, out of the greatness of his wealth, will, in glory, fully satisfy your every need, through your union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>To him, our God and Father, be ascribed all glory for every and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Give my greeting to everyone of the people of Christ Jesus. The Lord's followers who are with me send your their greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All Christ’s people here, and especially those who belong to the Emperor’s household, send theirs.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.</verse>
