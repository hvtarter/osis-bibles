        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The first account which I drew up, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the very first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>down to that day on which he was taken up to heaven, after he had, by the help of the Holy Spirit, given instructions to the apostles whom he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>With abundant proofs, he showed himself to them, still living, after his death; appearing to them from time to time during forty days, and speaking of all that related to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And once, when he had gathered them together, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise — he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>So, when the apostles had met together, they asked Jesus this question — “Master, is this the time when you intend to re-establish the kingdom for Israel?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>His answer was:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>No sooner had Jesus said this than he was caught up before their eyes, and a cloud received him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While they were still gazing up into the heavens, as he went, suddenly two men, clothed in white, stood beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>and said: “People of Galilee, why are you standing here looking up into the heavens? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into the heavens, will come in the same way in which you have seen him go into the heavens.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is about three quarters of a mile from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they reached Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room, where they were staying. There were there Peter, John, James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>They all united in devoting themselves to prayer, and so did some women, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>About this time, at a meeting of the Lord's followers, when there were about a hundred and twenty present, Peter rose to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>“Friends,” he said, “it was necessary who the prediction of scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit made by the lips of David about Judas, who acted as guide to the men that arrested Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>for he was one of our number and had his part allotted him in this work of ours.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(This man had bought a piece of land with the price of his treachery; and, falling heavily, his body had burst open, and all his bowels protruded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>This became known to everyone living in Jerusalem, so that the field came to be called, in their language, ‘Akeldama,’ which means the ‘Field of Blood.’)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>“For in the book of Psalms,” Peter continued, “it is said —  ‘Let his home,And let no one live in it’;  and also —  ‘His office let another take.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Therefore, from among the men who have been with us all the time that Jesus, our Master, went in and out among us —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>From his baptism by John down to that day on which he was taken from us — some one must be found to join us as a witness of his resurrection.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabas, whose other name was Justus, and Matthias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>and they offered this prayer —  “Lord, who reads all hearts, show which of these two men you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>To take the place in this apostolic work, which Judas has abandoned, to go to his proper place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they drew lots between them; and, the lot having fallen on Matthias, he was added to the number of the eleven apostles.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with strange ‘tongues’ as the Spirit prompted their utterances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians — yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own tongues of the great things that God has done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all utterly amazed and bewildered. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “What does it mean?” they asked one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But there were some who said with a sneer: “They have had too much new wine.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says,‘That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity;Your sons and your daughters will become prophets,Your young men will see visions,And your old men dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>Yes, even on the slaves — for they are mine — both men and women,I will in those days pour out my Spirit,And they will become prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will show wonders in the heavens above,And signs on the earth below —Blood and fire and mist of smoke;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will become darkness,And the moon blood-red,Before the day of the Lord comes — that great and awful day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>He, I say, in accordance with God’s definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said —  ‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes,For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight;Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For you will not abandon my soul to the place of death,Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have shown me the path to life,You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God ‘had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne,’ looked into the future,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that ‘he had not been abandoned to the place of death, nor had his body undergone corruption.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says —  ‘The Lord said to my master: “Sit on my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ — this Jesus whom you crucified.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Friends, what can we do?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>“Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them — “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>One day, as Peter and John were going up into the Temple Courts for the three o’clock Prayers, a man, who had been lame from his birth, was being carried by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>This man used to be set down every day at the gate of the Temple called ‘the Beautiful Gate,’ to beg of those who went in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John on the point of entering, he asked them to give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter fixed his eyes on him, and so did John, and then Peter said: “Look at us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>The man was all attention, expecting to get something from them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>but Peter added: “I have no gold or silver, but I give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>Grasping the lame man by the right hand, Peter lifted him up. Instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>and, leaping up, he stood and began to walk about, and then went with them into the Temple Courts, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking about and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and, when they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were utterly astonished and amazed at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While the man still clung to Peter and John, the people all quickly gathered around them in the Colonnade named after Solomon, in the greatest astonishment.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>On seeing this, Peter said to the people: “People of Israel, why are you surprised at this? And why do you stare at us, as though we, by any power or piety of our own, had enabled this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, has done honor to his servant Jesus — him whom you gave up and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to set him free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You, I say, disowned the holy and righteous one, and asked for the release of a murderer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>The guide to life you put to death! But God raised him from the dead — and of that we are ourselves witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And it is by faith in the name of Jesus, that this man, whom you all see and know, has — by his name — been made strong. Yes, it is the faith inspired by Jesus that has made this complete cure of the man, before the eyes of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And yet, my friends, I know that you acted as you did from ignorance, and your rulers also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But it was in this way that God fulfilled all that he had long ago foretold, as to the sufferings of his Christ, by the lips of all the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Therefore, repent and turn so that your sins may be wiped away; so that happier times may come from the Lord himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and so that he may send you, in Jesus, your long-appointed Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>But heaven must be his home, until the days of the Universal Restoration, of which God has spoken by the lips of his holy prophets from the very first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses himself said —  ‘The Lord your God will raise up from among yourselves a prophet, as he raised me. To him you will listen whenever he speaks to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it will be that should anyone among the people not listen to that prophet, he will be utterly destroyed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel onwards, and all their successors who had a message to deliver, told of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You yourselves are the heirs of the prophets, and heirs, too, of the covenant which God made with your ancestors, when he said to Abraham —  ‘In your descendants will all the nations of the earth be blessed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>For you, first, God raised up his servant, and sent him to bless you, by turning each one of you from his wicked ways.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>While Peter and John were still speaking to the people, the chief priest, with the officer in charge at the Temple and the Sadducees, came up to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>much annoyed because they were teaching the people, and because, through Jesus, they were preaching the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They arrested the apostles and, as it was already evening, had them placed in custody until the next day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>Many, however, of those who had heard the apostles’ message became believers in Christ, the number of the men alone amounting to about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next day, a meeting of the leaders of the people, the councillors, and the teachers of the law was held in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>There were present Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of High-Priestly rank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>They had Peter and John brought before them, and questioned them. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “By what power,” they asked, “Or in whose name have men like you done this thing?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said: “Leaders of the people and councillors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>since we are on our trial today for a kind act done to a helpless man, and are asked in what way the man here before you has been cured,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>let me tell you all and all the people of Israel, that it is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead — it is, I say, by his name that this man stands here before you lame no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>Jesus is ‘the stone which, scorned by you the builders, has yet become the corner stone.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And salvation is in him alone; for there is no other name in the whole world, given to people, to which we must look for our salvation.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>When the Council saw how boldly Peter and John spoke, and found that they were uneducated men of humble station, they were surprised, and realized that they had been companions of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>But, when they looked at the man who had been healed, standing there with them, they had nothing to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>So they ordered them out of court, and then began consulting together.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>“What are we to do to these men?” they asked one another. “That a remarkable sign has been given through them is obvious to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But, to prevent this thing from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak in this name any more to anyone whatever.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>So they called the apostles in, and ordered them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John replied: “Whether it is right, in the sight of God, to listen to you rather than to him —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>judge for yourselves, for we cannot help speaking of what we have seen and heard.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>However, after further warnings, the Council set them at liberty, not seeing any safe way of punishing them, because of the people, for they were all praising God for what had occurred;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>for the man who was the subject of this miraculous cure was more than forty years old.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>After they had been set at liberty, the apostles went to their friends and told them what the chief priests and the councillors had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>All who heard their story, moved by a common impulse, raised their voices to God in prayer:  “Sovereign Lord, it is you who has ‘made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>And who, by the lips of our ancestor, your servant David, who spoke under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have said —  ‘Why did the nations rage,And the peoples form vain designs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth set their array,And its rulers gathered together,Against the Lord and against his Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>There have indeed gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you has consecrated the Christ, not Herod and Pontius Pilate only, but the nations and the people of Israel besides —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>Yet only to do what you, by your power and of your own will, did long ago destine to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Now, therefore, Lord, mark their threats, and enable your servants, with all fearlessness, to tell your message,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the high priest asked: “Is this true?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>Stephen replied: “Brothers and fathers, hear what I have to say. God, who manifests himself in the glory, appeared to our ancestor Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, and before he settled in Haran, and said to him —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>‘Leave your country and your kindred, and come into the country that I will show you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>And so Abraham left the country of the Chaldaeans and settled in Haran; and from there, after his father’s death, God caused him to migrate into this country, in which you are now living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>God did not at that time give him any part of it, not even a foot of ground. But he promised to ‘give him possession of it and his descendants after him, though at that time he had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>God’s words were these — ‘Abraham’s descendants will live in a foreign country, where they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>But I myself will judge the nation, to which they will be enslaved,’ God said, ‘and after that they will leave the country and worship me in this place.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>Then God made with Abraham the covenant of circumcision; and under it Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him when he was eight days old; and Isaac became the father of Jacob; and Jacob of the Twelve Patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>The Patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and delivered him out of all his troubles, and enabled him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him Governor of Egypt and of his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>Then a famine spread over the whole of Egypt and Canaan, causing great distress, and our ancestors could find no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>Hearing, however, that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob sent our ancestors there on their first visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>In the course of their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>and their bodies were removed to Shechem, and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>As the time drew near for the fulfillment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people increased largely in numbers in Egypt,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>This king acted deceitfully towards our race and ill-treated our ancestors, making them abandon their own infants, so that they should not be reared.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>At these words Moses took to flight, and became an exile in Midian; and there he had two sons born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>Forty years had passed when there appeared to him, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>When Moses saw it, he was astonished at the vision; but on his going nearer to look at it more closely, the voice of the Lord was heard to say —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled, and did not dare to look.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>This same Moses, whom they had disowned with the words — ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’ was the man whom God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer, under the guidance of the angel that had appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>He it was who led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the desert during forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>This was the Moses who said to the people of Israel — ‘God will raise up for you, from among yourselves, a prophet, as he raised up me.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Instantly it seemed as if a film fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>On his arrival in Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was really a disciple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>At Jaffa there lived a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which is in Greek ‘Dorcas’ — a Gazelle. Her life was spent in doing kind and charitable actions.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>Among other places Paul went to Derbe and Lystra. At the latter place they found a disciple, named Timothy, whose mother was a Jewess who had become a believer in Christ, while his father was a Greek,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Wishing to take this man with him on his journey, Paul caused him to be circumcised out of consideration for the Jews in that neighborhood, for they all knew that his father had been a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>As they traveled from town to town, they gave the followers the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and officers of the church at Jerusalem, for them to observe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches grew stronger in the faith, and increased in numbers from day to day.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas came to Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>and, following his usual custom, Paul joined them, and for three Sabbaths addressed them, drawing his arguments from the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>He laid before them and explained that the Christ must undergo suffering and rise from the dead; and “It is this man,” he declared, “who is the Christ — this Jesus about whom I am telling you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of the people were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and Silas, as did also a large body of Greeks who were accustomed to join in the Jewish services, and a great number of leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jewish leaders, becoming jealous, engaged some worthless fellows from the streets, and, getting a mob together, kept the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, with the intention of bringing Paul and Silas before the Popular Assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>and, not finding them there, they proceeded to drag Jason and some of the Lord's followers before the city magistrates, shouting out: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “These men, who have turned the world upside down, have now come here,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>and have been harbored by Jason! They say that some one else is king — a man called Jesus!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>On hearing this, the people and the city magistrates were much concerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>and, before letting them go, they took bail from Jason and the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>That very night the followers sent Paul and Silas off to Beroea; and on reaching that place, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These Jews of Beroea were better disposed than those in Thessalonica, for they welcomed the message with great readiness, and daily examined the scriptures to see if what was said was true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>As a consequence, many of them became believers in Christ, besides a considerable number of Greek women of position, and of men also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But, when the Jewish leaders in Thessalonica found out that God’s message had been delivered by Paul at Beroea, they came there too, exciting and disturbing the minds of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>The followers immediately arranged for Paul to go away to the coast, but both Silas and Timothy stayed behind in Beroea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>The friends who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a message for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they started on their return.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>While Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his heart was stirred at seeing the whole city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who joined in their worship, as well as daily in the public Square with those who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Among others, some Epicurean and Stoic Philosophers joined issue with him. Some asked “What is this prater wanting to make out?”, while others said “He seems to be a preacher of foreign Deities.” (This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>So they laid hold of him and took him to the Court of Areopagus. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “May we hear,” they asked, “what new teaching this is which you are giving?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you are bringing some strange things to our notice, and we should like to know what they mean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(All Athenians and the foreigners staying in the city found no time for anything else but telling, or listening to, the last new thing.)  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>So Paul took his stand in the middle of the Court, and said — “People of Athens, on every hand I see signs of your being very devout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I was going about, looking at your sacred shrines, I came upon an altar with this inscription — ‘To an Unknown God.’ What, therefore, you worship in ignorance, that I am now proclaiming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and all things that are in it — he, Lord as he is of heaven and Earth, does not live in temples made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>neither do human hands minister to his wants, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives, to all, life, and breath, and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>He made all races of the earth’s surface — fixing a time for their rise and fall, and the limits of their settlements —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>That they might search for God, if by any means they might feel their way to him and find him. And yet he is not really far from any one of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in him we live and move and are. To use the words of some of your own poets —  ‘His offspring, too, are we.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Therefore, as the offspring of God, we must not think that the Deity has any resemblance to anything made of gold, or silver, or stone — a work of human art and imagination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>True, God looked with indulgence on the days of people’s ignorance, but now he is announcing to everyone everywhere the need for repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has fixed a day on which he intends to ‘judge the world with justice,’ by a man whom he has appointed — and of this he has given all people a pledge by raising this man from the dead.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>On hearing of a resurrection of the dead, some began jeering, but others said that they wanted to hear what he had to say about that another time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paul left the Court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>There were, however, some people who joined him, and became believers in Christ. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and several others.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>On leaving Athens, Paul next went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>There he met a Jew of the name of Aquila, from Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had lately come from Italy, in consequence of the order which had been issued by the Emperor Claudius for all Jews to leave Rome. Paul paid them a visit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and, since their trade was the same as his, he stayed and worked with them — their trade was tent-making.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>Every Sabbath Paul gave addresses in the synagogue, trying to convince both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>But, when Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to delivering the message, earnestly maintaining before the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>However, as they set themselves against him and became abusive, Paul shook his clothes in protest and said to them: “Your blood be on your own heads. My conscience is clear. From this time forward I will go to the Gentiles.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he left, and went to the house of a certain Titius Justus, who had been accustomed to join in the worship of God, and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus, the synagogue leader, came to believe in the Lord, and so did all his household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened to Paul, became believers in Christ and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>One night the Lord said to Paul, in a vision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So he settled there for a year and a half, and taught God’s message among the people.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>While Gallio was governor of Greece, some of the Jewish leaders made a combined attack on Paul, and brought him before the Governor’s Bench,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>charging him with persuading people to worship God in a way forbidden by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Just as Paul was on the point of speaking, Gallio said to them: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “If this were a case of misdemeanor or some serious crime, there would be some reason for my listening patiently to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but, since it is a dispute about words, and names, and your own law, you must see to it yourselves. I do not choose to be a judge in such matters.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>Saying this, he drove them back from the Bench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then they all set on Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and beat him in front of the Bench, but Gallio did not trouble himself about any of these things.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul remained there some time after this, and then took leave of the followers, and sailed to Syria with Priscilla and Aquila, but not before his head had been shaved at Cenchreae, because he was under a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>They put into Ephesus, and there Paul, leaving his companions, went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they asked him to prolong his stay, he declined, saying however,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>as he took his leave, “I will come back again to you, please God,” and then set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>On reaching Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and exchanged greetings with the church, and then went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After making some stay in Antioch, he set out on a tour through the Phrygian district of Galatia, strengthening the faith of all the disciples as he went.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Meanwhile there had come to Ephesus an Alexandrian Jew, named Apollos, an eloquent man, who was well-versed in the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He had been well-instructed in the cause of the Lord, and with burning zeal he spoke of, and taught carefully, the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>This man began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained the cause of God to him more carefully still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>When he wanted to cross to Greece, the followers furthered his plans, and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On his arrival he proved of great assistance to those who had, through the loving kindness of God, become believers in Christ,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland districts of Roman Asia, and went to Ephesus. There he found some disciples, of whom he asked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>“Did you, when you became believers in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “No,” they answered, “we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>Paul went to the synagogue there, and for three months spoke out fearlessly, giving addresses and trying to convince his hearers, about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>Some of them, however, hardened their hears and refused to believe, denouncing the cause before the people. So Paul left them and withdrew his disciples, and gave daily addresses in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered that Paul was in prison at Caesarea, and that he himself would be leaving for that place shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>“So let the influential men among you,” he said, “go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, charge him formally with it.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But, as Festus wished to gain popularity with the Jews, he interrupted Paul with the question: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>“No,” replied Paul, “I am standing at the Emperor’s court, where I ought to be tried. I have not wronged the Jews, as you yourself are well aware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If, however, I am breaking the law and have committed any offense deserving death, I do not ask to escape the penalty; but, if there is nothing in the accusations of these people, no one has the power to give me up to them.

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>and, as they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king. “There is a man here,” he said, “left a prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priest and the councillors laid an information, demanding judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>My answer to them was, that it was not the practice of Romans to give up anyone to their accusers until the accused had met them face to face, and had also had an opportunity of answering the charges brought against them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>But, when his accusers came forward, they brought no charge of wrong-doing such as I had expected;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but I found that there were certain questions in dispute between them about their own religion, and about some dead man called Jesus, whom Paul declared to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And, as I was at a loss how to enquire into questions of this kind, I asked Paul if he were willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be put on trial there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>As it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were put in charge of a captain of the Augustan Guard, named Julius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>We went on board a ship from Adramyttium, which was on the point of sailing to the ports along the coast of Roman Asia, and put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>So I beg you to take something to eat; your safety depends on it, for not one of you will lose even a hair of his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>With these words he took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving to God before them all, broke it in pieces, and began to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>and the men all felt cheered and had something to eat themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>There were about seventy-six of us on board, all told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>After satisfying their hunger, they further lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When daylight came, they could not make out what land it was, but, observing a creek in which there was a beach, they consulted as to whether they could run the ship safely into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>Then they cast off, and abandoned the anchors, and at the same time unlashed the gear of the steering oars, hoisted the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>They got, however, into a kind of channel, and there ran the ship aground. The bows stuck fast and could not be moved, while the stern began breaking up under the strain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The advice of the soldiers was that the prisoners should be killed, so that none of them could swim away and make their escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the Roman officer, anxious to save Paul, prevented their carrying out their intention, and ordered that those who could swim should be the first to jump into the sea and try to reach the shore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on different pieces of the ship. In these various ways everyone managed to get safely ashore.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The island's people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another: “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>In that neighborhood there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>There we found some of the Lord's followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said: “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor — not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>“We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the law of Moses and from the prophets — speaking from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only — [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>‘Go to this nation and say —“You will hear with your ears without ever understanding,And, though you have eyes, you will see without ever perceiving.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the mind of this nation has grown dense,And their ears are dull of hearing,Their eyes also have they closed;Otherwise some day they might see with their eyes,And with their ears they might hear,And in their mind they might understand, and might turn —And I might heal them.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles; and they will listen.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unmolested.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
