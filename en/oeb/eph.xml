        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>To Christ’s people at Ephesus who are faithful to him, from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, our Lord, who has blessed us on high with every spiritual blessing, in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>For he chose us in our union with Christ before the creation of the universe, so that we might be holy and blameless in his sight, living in the spirit of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>From the first he destined us, in his goodwill towards us, to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>and so to enhance that glorious manifestation of his loving kindness which he gave us in the one he loves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>for in him, and through the shedding of his blood, we have found redemption in the pardon of our offenses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>All this accords with the loving kindness which God lavished on us, accompanied by countless gifts of wisdom and discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>when he made known to us his hidden purpose. And it also accords with the goodwill which God purposed to exhibit in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>in view of that divine order which was to mark the completion of the ages, when he should make everything, both in heaven and on earth, centre in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In him, I say, for by our union with him we became God’s heritage, having from the first been destined for this in the intention of him who, in all that happens, is carrying out his own fixed purpose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>that we should enhance his glory — we who have been the first to rest our hopes on the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>And you, too, by your union with him, after you had heard the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation — you believed in him and were sealed as his by receiving the holy Spirit, which he had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>And the Spirit is a pledge of our future heritage, foreshadowing the full redemption of God’s own people — to enhance his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>And therefore I, ever since I heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which prevails among you, and of your confidence in all Christ’s people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>have never omitted to thank God on your behalf, whenever I make mention of you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>My prayer is that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord, the all-glorious Father, may inspire you with wisdom and true insight through a fuller knowledge of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>that your minds may be so enlightened that you may realize the hope given by God’s call, the wealth of the glory of his heritage among Christ’s people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and the transcendent greatness of the power which he is able to exercise in dealing with us who believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>The same mighty power was exerted on the Christ, when he raised the Christ from the dead and ‘caused him to sit at his right hand’ on high, exalting him above all angels and archangels of every rank,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>and above every name that can be named, whether in the present age, or in the age to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And God placed ‘all things under Christ’s feet,’ and gave him to the church as its supreme head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>for the church is Christ’s body, and is filled by him who fills all things everywhere with his presence.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>You yourselves were once dead because of your offenses and sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>For at one time you lived in sin, following the ways of the world, in subjection to the Ruler of the powers of the air — the Spirit who is still at work among the disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>And it was among them that we all once lived our lives, indulging the cravings of our earthly nature, and carrying out the desires prompted by that earthly nature and by our own thoughts. Our nature exposed us to the divine wrath, like the rest of humanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>Yet God, in his abundant compassion, and because of the great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even though we were ‘dead’ because of our offenses, gave life to us in giving life to the Christ. (By God’s loving kindness you have been saved.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>And, through our union with Christ Jesus, God raised us with him, and caused us to sit with him on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>in order that, by his goodness to us in Christ Jesus, he might display in the ages to come the boundless wealth of his loving kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For it is by God’s loving kindness that you have been saved, through your faith. It is not due to yourselves; the gift is God’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>It is not due to obedience to law, so that no one can boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are God’s handiwork, created, by our union with Christ Jesus, for the good actions in doing which God had pre-arranged that we should spend our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Remember, therefore, that you were once Gentiles yourselves, as your bodies showed; you were called ‘The Uncircumcised’ by those who were called ‘The Circumcised’ — circumcised only by human hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>Remember that you were at that time far from Christ; you were shut out from the citizenship of Israel; you were strangers to the Covenants founded on God’s Promise; you were in the world without hope and without God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now, through your union with Christ Jesus, you who once were ‘far off’ have, by the shedding of the blood of the Christ, been brought ‘near.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>He it is who is our peace. He made the two divisions of humanity one, broke down the barrier that separated them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>and in his human nature put an end to the cause of enmity between them — the law with its injunctions and ordinances — in order to create, through union with himself, from Jew and Gentile, one new humanity and so make peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>And when, on the cross, he had destroyed their mutual enmity, he sought by means of his cross to reconcile them both to God, united in one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>He came with the good news of peace for you who were ‘far off,’ and of peace for those who were ‘near’;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>for it is through him that we, the Jews and the Gentiles, united in the one Spirit, are now able to approach the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>It follows, then, that you are no longer strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens with Christ’s people and members of God’s Household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>You have been built up on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being ‘the corner-stone.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>United in him, every part of the building, closely joined together, will grow into a Temple, consecrated by its union with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>And, through union in him, you also are being built up together, to be a place where God lives through the Spirit.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ’s people —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God’s Promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>Of this good news I became a minister, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ’s people, was this charge entrusted! — to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to make clear what is God’s way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>From whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ’s people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to understand — though it surpasses all understanding — the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I beg you, then — I who am a prisoner in the Master’s cause — to live lives worthy of the call that you have received;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>always humble and gentle, patient, bearing lovingly with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>and striving to maintain in the bond of peace the unity given by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is but one body and one Spirit, just as there was but one hope set before you when you received your call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>There is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>There is but one God and Father of all — the God who is over all, pervades all, and is in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>Everyone of us, however, has been entrusted with some charge, each in accordance with the extent of the gift of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>That is why it is said —  ‘When he went up on high, he led his captives into captivity. And gave gifts to humanity.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now surely this ‘going up’ must imply that he had already gone down into the world beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who went down is the same as he who went up — up beyond the highest heaven, so that he might fill all things with his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he it is who gave to the church apostles, prophets, Missionaries, Pastors, and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>to fit his people for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>And this will continue, until we all attain to that unity which is given by faith and by a fuller knowledge of the Son of God; until we reach maturity — the full standard of the perfection of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>Then we will no longer be like infants, tossed backward and forward, blown about by every breath of human teaching and by people's trickery and craftiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but holding the truth in a spirit of love, we will grow into complete union with him who is our head — Christ himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>For from him the whole body, closely joined and knit together by the contact of every part with the source of its life, derives its power to grow, in proportion to the vigour of each individual part; and so is being built up in a spirit of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This, then, as one in union with the Lord, I implore: Do not continue to live such purposeless lives as the Gentiles live,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>with their powers of discernment darkened, cut off from the life of God, owing to the ignorance that prevails among them and to the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Lost to all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to licentiousness, in order to practice every kind of impurity without restraint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But far different is the lesson you learned from the Christ — if, that is, you really listened to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>and through union with him were taught the truth, as it is to be found in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>For you learned with regard to your former way of living that you must cast off your old nature, which, yielding to deluding passions, grows corrupt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>that the spirit of your minds must be constantly renewed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and that you must clothe yourselves in that new nature which was created to resemble God, with the righteousness and holiness springing from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Since, therefore, you have cast off what is false, ‘you must every one of you speak the truth to your neighbors.’ For we are united to one another like the parts of a body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>‘Be angry, yet do not sin.’ Do not let the sun go down on your anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>and give no opportunity to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let the person who steals steal no longer, but rather let them toil with their hands at honest work, so that they may have something to share with anyone in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Never let any foul word pass your lips, but only such good words as the occasion demands, so that they may be a help to those who hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And do not grieve God’s Holy Spirit; for it was through that Spirit that God sealed you as his, against the day of Redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, passion, anger, brawling, and abusive language be banished from among you, as well as all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, ready to forgive one another, just as God, in Christ, forgave you.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Therefore imitate God, as his dear children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and live a life of love, following the example of the Christ, who loved you and gave himself for you as ‘an offering and a sacrifice to God, that should be fragrant and acceptable.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>As for sexual immorality and every kind of impurity, or greed, do not let them even be mentioned among you, as befits Christ’s people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>nor shameful conduct, nor foolish talk or jesting, for they are wholly out of place among you; but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For of this you may be sure — that no one who is unchaste or impure or greedy of gain (for to be greedy of gain is idolatry) has any place awaiting him in the kingdom of the Christ and God.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Do not let anyone deceive you with specious arguments. Those are the sins that bring down the wrath of God on the disobedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore have nothing to do with such people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For, although you were once in darkness, now, by your union with the Lord, you are in the light. Live as ‘children of light’ —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>For the outcome of life in the light may be seen in every form of goodness, righteousness, and sincerity —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Always trying to find out what is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>Take no part in deeds of darkness, from which no good can come; on the contrary, expose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>It is degrading even to speak of the things continually done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>All such actions, when exposed, have their true character made manifest by the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>For everything that has its true character made manifest is clear as light. And that is why it is said —  ‘Sleeper, awake!Arise from the dead,And the Christ will give you light!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Take great care, then, how you live — not unwisely but wisely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>making the most of every opportunity; for these are evil days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not grow thoughtless, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>Do not drink wine to excess, for that leads to profligacy; but seek to be filled with the Spirit of God, and speak to one another in psalms and hymns and sacred songs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>Always give thanks for everything to our God and Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives should submit to their husbands as submitting to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For a man is the head of his wife, as the Christ is the head of the church — being indeed himself the Savior of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church submits to the Christ, so also should wives submit to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, just as the Christ loved the church, and gave himself for her,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>so that he might himself bring the church, in all her beauty, into his own presence, with no spot or wrinkle or blemish of any kind, but that she might be holy and faultless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>That is how husbands ought to love their wives — as if they were their own bodies. A man who loves his wife is really loving himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>for no one ever yet hated his own body. But everyone feeds his body and cares for it, just as the Christ for the church;</verse>
