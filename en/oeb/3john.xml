        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>To his dear friend Gaius, whom he sincerely loves, From the officer of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Dear friend, I pray that all may be well with you and that you may have good health — I know that all is well with your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For it was a great joy to me, when some followers of the Lord came and testified to your fidelity to the truth — I know that your own life is guided by the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to hear from time to time that the lives of my children are guided by the truth.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Dear friend, whatever you do for other followers is done in a Christian spirit — even when they are strangers to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>They themselves have testified before the church to your love; and you will do well to help them on their way in a manner worthy of the service of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For it was on behalf of the name that they left their homes, and refused to take anything from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We, therefore, ought to give such people a hearty welcome, and so take our share in their work for the truth.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote a few lines to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, declines to recognize us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, when I come, I will not forget his conduct in ridiculing us with his wicked tongue. Not content with that, he not only declines to recognize our friends who are followers himself, but actually prevents those who would, and expels them from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Dear friend, take what is good for your example, not what is bad. The person who does what is good is from God; the person who does what is bad has never seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Everyone has always had a good word for Demetrius, and the truth itself speaks for him. Yes, and we also add our good word, and you know that what we say about him is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I have a great deal to say to you, but I do not care to trust it to pen and ink in a letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>I hope, however, it will not be long before I see you, and then we will speak face to face. Peace be with you. Our friends here send you their greetings. Greet each one of our friends.</verse>
