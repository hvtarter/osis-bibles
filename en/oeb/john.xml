        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning the Word was;and the Word was with God;and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>through him all things came into being,and nothing came into being apart from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>That which came into being in him was life;and the life was the light of humanity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>and the light shines in the darkness,and the darkness never overpowered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>he came as a witness — to bear witness to the lightso that through him everyone might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light,but he came to bear witness to the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true light which enlightens everyone coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world;and through him the world came into being —yet the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own —yet his own did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But to all who did receive him he gave power to become children of God —to those who believe in his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to human will did they owe the new life,but to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became human, and lived among us,(We saw his glory — the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father),full of love and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud — for it was he who spoke —“‘He who is coming’ after me is now before me,for he was ever first”);</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>out of his fullness we have all received some gift,gift after gift of love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>for the law was given through Moses,love and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever yet seen God;God the Only Son, who is ever with the Father —He has revealed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John — “Who are you?”,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>he told them clearly and simply: “I am not the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>“Who then are you?” they continued; “tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>“I,” he answered, “am —  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness — “make a straight road for the Lord”’,  as the prophet Isaiah said.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>These men had been sent from the Pharisees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>and their next question was: “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John’s answer was — “I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>I was taking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him — he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: “There is the Lamb of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>But Jesus turned around, and saw them following. he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘teacher’), “where are you staying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] It was then about four in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said: (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>He found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and of whom the prophets also wrote — Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph’s son!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael. replied Jesus, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>asked Jesus,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him: “They have no wine left.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>answered Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants: “Do whatever he tells you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of ‘purification,’ each holding twenty or thirty gallons.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to the servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added: The servants did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from — although the servants who had taken out the water knew —</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>He called the groom and said to him: “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum — he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and said to the pigeon-dealers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that scripture said — ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus: “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>was his answer, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>Afterwards, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them..</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a leading man among his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one could give such signs as you are giving, unless God were with him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>exclaimed Jesus, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>“How can a person,” asked Nicodemus, “be born when they are old? Can they be born a second time?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>“How can that be?” asked Nicodemus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>exclaimed Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the country parts of Judea; and there he stayed with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>(For John had not yet been imprisoned).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of ‘purification;’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>and the disciples came to John and said: “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony — he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John’s answer was — “A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You are yourselves witnesses that I said ‘I am not the Christ,’ but ‘I have been sent before him as a messenger.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom’s friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom’s voice. This joy I have felt to the full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must become greater, and I less.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God’s own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under ‘God’s displeasure.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>He had to pass through Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob’s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her —</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>“How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>“You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said; “where did you get that ‘living water?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>“Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>said Jesus, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>“I have no husband,” answered the woman. replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>“I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>“It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>“I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>“Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him: “Take something to eat, Rabbi.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>he answered, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>“Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>replied Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>
        [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]
      </verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Many from that town came to believe in Jesus — Samaritans though they were — because the woman had said: ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman: “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king’s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>“Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered: “Go, your son is living.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the people any more, but left that neighborhood, and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him: “Do you refuse to speak to me? Do not you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross — ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests said to Pilate: “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said — ‘I am the king of the Jews.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>But Pilate answered: “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares — a share for each soldier — and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to one another: “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture —  ‘They shared my clothes among them,And over my clothing they cast lots.’  That was what the soldiers did.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed: Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus — but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities — begged Pilate’s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus, too — the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night — came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and he saw for himself and was convinced.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>It was in this way: — Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>“I am going fishing.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>he said, [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “No,” they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>he said, So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>And Jesus said to them: Not one of the disciples ventured to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>Then, a second time, Jesus asked: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>The third time, Jesus said to him: Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed: “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following — the one who at the supper leant back on the Master’s shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus: “Master, what about this man?”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.</verse>
