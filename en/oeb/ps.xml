        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Happy are thosewho do not follow the counsel of the wicked,not halting in ways frequented by sinners,nor taking a seat in a gathering of scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But the law of the Lord is their joy,they study it day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>They are like treesplanted by runlets of water,yielding fruit in due season,leaves never fading.In all that they do, they prosper. </verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>Not so fare the wicked, not so;like chaff are they, blown by the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment,nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For the way of the righteous is dear to the Lord,but the way of the wicked will end in ruin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why this turmoil of nations,this futile plotting of peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>with kings of the earth conspiring,and rulers consulting together,against the Lord and against his anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>to snap their bondsand fling their cords away? </verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He whose throne is in heaven laughs,the Lord mocks them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then he speaks to them in his wrath,and in his hot anger confounds them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>“This my king is installed by me,on Zion my holy mountain.” </verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will tell of the Lord’s decree.He said to me: “You are my son,this day I became your father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You will break them with sceptre of iron,shatter them like pottery.” </verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>So now, you kings, be wise:be warned, you rulers of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve the Lord in awe,kiss his feet with trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin;for soon will his fury blaze.Happy all who take refuge in him.</verse>
