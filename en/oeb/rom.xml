        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>To all in Rome who are dear to God and have been called to become Christ’s people, from Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, who has been called to become an apostle, and has been set apart to tell God’s good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>This good news God promised long ago through his prophets in the sacred scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who, as to his human nature, was descended from David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>but, as to the spirit of holiness within him, was miraculously designated Son of God by his resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>Through him we received the gift of the apostolic office, to win submission to the faith among all nations for the glory of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>And among these nations are you — you who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ about you all, because the report of your faith is spreading throughout the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>God, to whom I offer the worship of my soul as I tell the goodness of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you when I pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>asking that, if he be willing, I may some day at last find the way open to visit you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift and so give you fresh strength —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>or rather that both you and I may find encouragement in each other’s faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>I want you to know, my friends, that I have many times intended coming to see you — but until now I have been prevented — that I might find among you some fruit of my labors, as I have already among the other nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I have a duty to both the Greek and the barbarian, to both the cultured and the ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>And so, for my part, I am ready to tell the good news to you also who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is the power of God which brings salvation to everyone who believes in Christ, to the Jew first, but also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it there is a revelation of the divine righteousness resulting from faith and leading on to faith; as scripture says — ‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>So, too, there is a revelation from heaven of the divine wrath against every form of ungodliness and wickedness on the part of those people who, by their wicked lives, are stifling the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>This is so, because what can be known about God is plain to them; for God himself has made it plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For ever since the creation of the universe God’s invisible attributes — his everlasting power and divinity — are to be seen and studied in his works, so that people have no excuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>because, although they learned to know God, yet they did not offer him as God either praise or thanksgiving. Their speculations about him proved futile, and their undiscerning minds were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing to be wise, they showed themselves fools;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and they transformed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of mortal humans, and of birds, and beasts, and reptiles.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God abandoned them to impurity, letting them follow the cravings of their hearts, until they dishonored their own bodies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>for they had substituted a lie for the truth about God, and had reverenced and worshiped created things more than the Creator, who is to be praised for ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>That, I say, is why God abandoned them to degrading passions. Even the women among them perverted the natural use of their bodies to the unnatural;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>while the men, disregarding that for which women were intended by nature, were consumed with passion for one another. Men indulged in vile practices with men, and incurred in their own persons the inevitable penalty for their perverseness.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>Then, as they would not keep God before their minds, God abandoned them to depraved thoughts, so that they did all kinds of shameful things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>They reveled in every form of wickedness, evil, greed, vice. Their lives were full of envy, murder, quarreling, treachery, malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>They became back-biters, slanderers, impious, insolent, boastful. They devised new sins. They disobeyed their parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>They were undiscerning, untrustworthy, without natural affection or pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Well aware of God’s decree, that those who do such things deserve to die, not only are they guilty of them themselves, but they even applaud those who do them.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you have nothing to say in your own defense, whoever you are who set yourself up as a judge. In judging others you condemn yourself, for you who set yourself up as a judge do the very same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>And we know that God’s judgment falls unerringly on those who do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>You who judge those that do such things and yet are yourself guilty of them — do you suppose that you of all people will escape God’s judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you think lightly of his abundant kindness, patience, and forbearance, not realizing that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>Hard-hearted and impenitent as you are, you are storing up for yourself wrath on the ‘day of wrath,’ when God’s justice as a judge will be revealed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>for ‘he will give to everyone what their actions deserve.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To those who, by perseverance in doing good, aim at glory, honor, and all that is imperishable, he will give immortal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>while as to those who are factious, and disobedient to truth but obedient to evil, wrath and anger, distress and despair,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>will fall on every human being who persists in wrong-doing — on the Jew first, but also on the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does right — for the Jew first, but also for the Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>since God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>All who, when they sin, are without law will also perish without law; while all who, when they sin, are under law, will be judged as being under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>It is not those who hear the words of a law that are righteous before God, but it is those who obey it that will be pronounced righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When Gentiles, who have no law, do instinctively what the law requires, they, though they have no law, are a law to themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>for they show the demands of the law written on their hearts; their consciences corroborating it, while in their thoughts they argue either in self-accusation or, it may be, in self-defense —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>on the day when God passes judgment on people’s inmost lives, as the good news that I tell declares that he will do through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But, perhaps, you bear the name of ‘Jew,’ and are relying on law, and boast of belonging to God, and understand his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and, having been carefully instructed from the law, have learned to appreciate the finer moral distinctions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>Perhaps you are confident that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in the dark, an instructor of the unintelligent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>and a teacher of the childish, because in the law you possess the outline of all knowledge and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Why, then, you teacher of others, do not you teach yourself? Do you preach against stealing, and yet steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>Do you forbid adultery, and yet commit adultery? Do you loathe idols, and yet plunder temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Boasting, as you do, of your law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For, as scripture says — ‘The Gentiles insult God's name because of you’!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision has its value, if you are obeying the law. But, if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision is no better than uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If, then, an uncircumcised man pays regard to the requirements of the law, will not he, although not circumcised, be regarded by God as if he were?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>Indeed, the person who, owing to his birth, remains uncircumcised, and yet scrupulously obeys the law, will condemn you, who, for all your written law and your circumcision, are yet a breaker of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For a man who is only a Jew outwardly is not a real Jew; nor is outward bodily circumcision real circumcision. The real Jew is the person who is a Jew in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>and the real circumcision is the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal thing. Such a person wins praise from God, though not from people.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God’s utterances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God — ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But what if our wrong-doing makes God’s righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Otherwise how can God judge the world?  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Why should we not say — as some people slanderously assert that we do say — ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just!  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As scripture says —  ‘There is not even one who is righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>not one who understands,not one who is searching for God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They have all gone astray;they have one and all become depraved;there is no one who is doing good — no, not one!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>‘Their throats are like opened graves;they deceive with their tongues.’‘The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>‘Swift are their feet to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Distress and trouble dog their steps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and the path of peace they do not know.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that everything said in the law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God's judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>For ‘no human being will be pronounced righteous before God’ as the result of obedience to law; for it is law that shows what sin is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, quite apart from law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the law and the prophets bear witness —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and all fall short of God’s glorious ideal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of law? A law requiring obedience? No, a law requiring faith.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Is not he also the God of the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we, then, use this faith to abolish law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish law.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then, it may be asked, are we to say about Abraham, the ancestor of our nation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If he was pronounced righteous as the result of obedience, then he has something to boast of. Yes, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what are the words of scripture? ‘Abraham had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now wages are regarded as due to the person who works, not as a favor, but as a debt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>while, as for the person who does not rely on their obedience, but has faith in him who can pronounce the godless righteous, their faith is regarded by God as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>In precisely the same way David speaks of the blessing pronounced on the person who is regarded by God as righteous apart from actions —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>‘Blessed are those whose wrong-doings have been forgiven and over whose sins a veil has been drawn!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed the man whom the Lord will never regard as sinful!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessing, then, pronounced on the circumcised only or on the uncircumcised as well? We say that — ‘Abraham’s faith was regarded by God as righteousness.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>Under what circumstances, then, did this take place? After his circumcision or before it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>Not after, but before. And it was as a sign of this that he received the rite of circumcision — to show the righteousness due to the faith of an uncircumcised man — in order that he might be the father of all who have faith in God even when uncircumcised, so that they also may be regarded by God as righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>as well as father of the circumcised — to those who are not only circumcised, but who also follow our father Abraham in that faith which he had while still uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should inherit the world did not come to Abraham or his descendants through law, but through the righteousness due to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>If those who take their stand on law are to inherit the world, then faith is robbed of its meaning and the promise comes to nothing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Law entails punishment; but, where no law exists, no breach of it is possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>That is why everything is made to depend on faith: so that everything may be God’s gift, and in order that the fulfillment of the promise may be made certain for all Abraham’s descendants — not only for those who take their stand on the law, but also for those who take their stand on the faith of Abraham. (He is the Father of us all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>as scripture says — ‘I have made you the Father of many nations.’) And this they do in the sight of that God in whom Abraham had faith, and who gives life to the dead, and speaks of what does not yet exist as if it did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>With no ground for hope, Abraham, sustained by hope, put faith in God; in order that, in fulfillment of the words — ‘So many will your descendants be,’ he might become ‘the Father of many nations.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>Though he was nearly a hundred years old, yet his faith did not fail him, even when he thought of his own body, then utterly worn out, and remembered that Sarah was past bearing children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He was not led by want of faith to doubt God’s promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>On the contrary, his faith gave him strength; and he praised God, in the firm conviction that what God has promised he is also able to carry out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore his faith ‘was regarded as righteousness.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now these words — ‘it was regarded as righteousness’ — were not written with reference to Abraham only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but also with reference to us. Our faith, too, will be regarded by God in the same light, if we have faith in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>for Jesus ‘was given up to death to atone for our offenses,’ and was raised to life that we might be pronounced righteous.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God’s favor in which we not stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God’s glorious ideal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and that ‘hope never disappoints.’ For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God’s good time, died on behalf of the godless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Even for an upright person scarcely anyone will die. For a really good person perhaps some one might even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, will we be saved by virtue of Christ’s life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all humanity, because every person has sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>Even before the time of the law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against someone where no law exists.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet, from Adam to Moses, death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam’s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But there is a contrast between Adam’s offense and God’s gracious gift. For, if by reason of the offense of the one man the whole race died, far more were the loving kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished on the whole race.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man’s sin. The judgment, which followed on the one man’s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God’s gracious gift, which followed on many offenses, resulted in a decree of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if, by reason of the offense of the one man, death reigned through that one man, far more will those, on whom God’s loving kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Briefly then, just as a single offense resulted for all humanity in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all humanity in that declaration of righteousness which brings life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What are we to say, then? Are we to continue to sin, in order that God’s loving kindness may be multiplied?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Heaven forbid! We became dead to sin, and how can we go on living in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or can it be that you do not know that all of us, who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus, in our baptism shared his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Consequently, through sharing his death in our baptism, we were buried with him; that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by a manifestation of the Father’s power, so we also may live a new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>If we have become united with him by the act symbolic of his death, surely we will also become united with him by the act symbolic of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>We recognize the truth that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the body, the stronghold of sin, might be rendered powerless, so that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For the man who has so died has been pronounced righteous and released from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>And our belief is, that, as we have shared Christ’s death, we will also share his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>We know, indeed, that Christ, having once risen from the dead, will not die again. Death has power over him no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For the death that he died was a death to sin, once and for all. But the life that he now lives, he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So let it be with you — regard yourselves as dead to sin, but as living for God, through union with Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies and compel you to obey its cravings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Do not offer any part of your bodies to sin, in the cause of unrighteousness, but once for all offer yourselves to God (as those who, though once dead, now have life), and devote every part of your bodies to the cause of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin will not lord it over you. You are living under the reign, not of law, but of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What follows, then? Are we to sin because we are living under the reign of love and not of law? Heaven forbid!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Surely you know that, when you offer yourselves as servants, to obey anyone, you are the servants of the person whom you obey, whether the service be a service sin which leads to death, or a service Duty which leads to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>God be thanked that, though you were once servants of sin, yet you learned to give hearty obedience to that form of doctrine under which you were placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Set free from the control of sin, you became servants to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I can but speak as people do because of the weakness of your earthly nature. Once you offered every part of your bodies to the service of impurity, and of wickedness, which leads to further wickedness. Now, in the same way, offer them to the service of righteousness, which leads to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>While you were still servants of sin, you were free as regards righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>But what were the fruits that you reaped from those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of such things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now that you have been set free from the control of sin, and have become servants to God, the fruit that you reap is an ever increasing holiness, and the end eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>The wages of sin are death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through union with Christ Jesus, our Lord.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Surely, friends, you know (for I am speaking to people who know what law means) that law has power over a person only as long as they lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband while he is living; but, if her husband dies, she is set free from the law that bound her to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>If, then, during her husband’s lifetime, she unites herself to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but, if her husband dies, the law has no further hold on her, nor, if she unites herself to another man, is she an adulteress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>And so with you, my friends; as far as the law was concerned, you underwent death in the crucified body of the Christ, so that you might be united to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that our lives might bear fruit for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>When we were living merely earthly lives, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were active in every part of our bodies, with the result that our lives bore fruit for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are set free from the law, because we are dead to that which once kept us under restraint; and so we serve under new, spiritual conditions, and not under old, written regulations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What are we to say, then? That law and sin are the same thing? Heaven forbid! On the contrary, I should not have learned what sin is, had not it been for law. If the law did not say ‘You must not covet,’ I should not know what it is to covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin took advantage of the Commandment to arouse in me every form of covetousness, for where there is no consciousness of law sin shows no sign of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>There was a time when I myself, unconscious of law, was alive; but when the Commandment was brought home to me, sin sprang into life, while I died!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>The Commandment that should have meant life I found to result in death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>sin took advantage of the Commandment to deceive me, and used it to bring about my death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>And so the law is holy, and each Commandment is also holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did, then, a thing, which in itself was good, involve death in my case? Heaven forbid! It was sin that involved death; so that, by its use of what I regarded as good to bring about my death, its true nature might appear; and in this way the Commandment showed how intensely sinful sin is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law is spiritual, but I am earthly — sold into slavery to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>I do not understand my own actions. For I am so far from habitually doing what I want to do, that I find myself doing the thing that I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But when I do what I want not to do, I am admitting that the law is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>This being so, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>I know that there is nothing good in me — I mean in my earthly nature. For, although it is easy for me to want to do right, to act rightly is not easy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>I fail to do the good thing that I want to do, but the bad thing that I want not to do — that I habitually do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But, when I do the thing that I want not to do, the action is no longer my own, but is done by the sin which is within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>This, then, is the law that I find — when I want to do right, wrong presents itself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>At heart I delight in the law of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but throughout my body I see a different law, one which is in conflict with the law accepted by my reason, and which endeavors to make me a prisoner to that law of sin which exists throughout my body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Thank God, there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, our Lord! Well then, for myself, with my reason I serve the law of God, but with my earthly nature the law of sin.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>for through your union with Christ Jesus, the law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>What law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the requirements of the law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the law of God, nor indeed can it do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>They who are earthly cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a son which leads us to cry ‘Abba, Our Father.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God’s children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if children, then heirs — heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ’s sufferings in order that we may also share his glory.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>All Nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>We know, indeed, that all Nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labor to this very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not Nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit — we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons — the redemption of our bodies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I ask, then, ‘Has God rejected his people?’ Heaven forbid! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not rejected his people, whom he chose from the first. Have you forgotten the words of scripture in the story of Elijah — how he appeals to God against Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>‘Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have pulled down your altars, and I only am left; and now they are eager to take my life.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what was the divine response? ‘I have kept for myself seven thousand who have never bowed the knee to Baal.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>And so in our own time, too, there is to be found a remnant of our nation selected by God in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if in love, then no longer as a result of obedience. Otherwise love would cease to be love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What follows from this? Why, that Israel as a nation failed to secure what it was seeking, while those whom God selected did secure it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>The rest grew callous; as scripture says — ‘God has given them a deadness of mind — eyes that are not to see and ears that are not to hear — and it is so to this very day.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I ask then — ‘Was their stumbling to result in their fall?’ Heaven forbid! On the contrary, through their falling away salvation has reached the Gentiles, to stir the rivalry of Israel.</verse>
