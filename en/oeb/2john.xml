        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

      <chapter osisID='2John.1'>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>To an eminent Christian Lady, and to her children, from the officer of the church. I sincerely love you all, and not I only, but also all those who have learned to know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>We love you for the sake of that truth which is always in our hearts; yes, and it will be ours for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Blessing, mercy, and peace will be ours — the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son — in a life of truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now, I pray you, Lady — not as though I were writing a new command for you; no, it is the command which we had from the first — Let us love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love — to live in obedience to the Father’s commands. This is the command as you learned from the first, to live in a spirit of love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>I say this because many impostors have left us to go into the world — people who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ come in our human nature. It is that which marks someone as an impostor and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Take care that you do not lose the fruit of all our work; rather, reap the benefit of it in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Everyone who goes beyond the limits of the teaching of the Christ has failed to find God; the person who keeps to that teaching — they have found both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or welcome them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his wicked work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Though I have a great deal to say to you, I would rather not trust it to paper and ink, but I am hoping to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that your joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your eminent sister send you their greetings.</verse>
