        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>This is how Jesus Christ was born: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] His mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but, before the marriage took place, she found herself to be pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Her husband, Joseph, was a religious man and, since he did not want to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to put an end to their engagement privately.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so, too, was all Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>“At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer; “for it is said in the prophet —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah’s land,are in no way least among the chief cities of Judah;for out of you will come a ruler —who will shepherd my people Israel.’” [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers, and found out from them the date of the appearance of the star;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and, sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and, as soon as you have found him, bring me word so that I, too, can go and worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached, and stood over, the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>At the sight of the star they were filled with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>But afterwards, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and there he stayed until Herod’s death; in fulfillment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says —  ‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that neighborhood, who were two years old or under, guided by the date which he had learned from the astrologers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>‘A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and mourning loudly;Rachel, weeping for her children,refusing all comfort for they were dead.’ [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>“Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child’s life are dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfillment of these words in the prophets — ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says —  ‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:“Make ready the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>John’s clothes were made of camels’ hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them: [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ] “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Let your life, then, prove your repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think that you can say among yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to prevent him. [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Jesus answered, So John agreed.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and from the heavens there came a voice which said: “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.”  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And, after he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>The Tempter came to him, and said:  “If you are God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But Jesus answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the Holy City, and, placing him on the parapet of the temple, said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>“If you are God’s Son, throw yourself down, for scripture says —  ‘He will give his angels commands about you,and on their hands they will lift you up,so you do not even strike your foot against a stone.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>answered Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>The third time, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain, and, showing him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor, said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>“All these I will give you, if you will fall at my feet and worship me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him alone, and angels came and helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>Afterwards, leaving Nazareth, he went and settled at Capernaum, which is by the side of the Sea, within the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>‘The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,the land of the Road by the Sea, and beyond the Jordan,with Galilee of the Gentiles —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who were living in darknesshave seen a great light,and, for those who were living in the shadow-land of death,a light has dawned!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>At that time Jesus began to proclaim —</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>As Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers — Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew — casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>Jesus said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>The two men left their nets at once and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going further on, he saw two other men who were also brothers, James, Zebedee’s son, and his brother John, in their boat with their father, mending their nets. Jesus called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they at once left their boat and their father, and followed him.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus went all through Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>and his fame spread all through Syria. They brought to him all who were ill with any form of disease, or who were suffering pain — any who were either possessed by demons, or were lunatic, or paralyzed; and he cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>He was followed by large crowds from Galilee, the district of the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.  [crosswire  amateurish codings versifikation may be wrong here ]</verse>
