        <description>The Open English Bible is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:   under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.   The OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament, which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.   As such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.    Our website is at http://openenglishbible.org</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='2Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>To the Thessalonian church in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>May God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>Friends, it is our duty always to thank God about you, as is but right, considering the wonderful growth of your faith, and because, without exception, your love for one another is continually increasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>So much is this the case that we ourselves speak with pride, before the churches of God, of the patience and faith which you have shown, in spite of all the persecutions and troubles that you are enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>These persecutions will vindicate the justice of God’s judgment, and will result in your being reckoned worthy of God’s kingdom, for the sake of which you are now suffering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since God deems it just to inflict suffering on those who are now inflicting suffering on you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give relief to you who are suffering, as well as to us, at the appearing of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, ‘in flaming fire.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>Then he will ‘inflict punishment on those who refuse to know God, and on those who turn a deaf ear’ to the good news of Jesus, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>They will pay the penalty of unutterable ruin — banished ‘from the presence of the Lord and from the glorious manifestation of his might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he comes to be honor ed in his people,’ and to be revered in all who have learned to believe in him (for you also believed our testimony) — as he will be on ‘that day.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>With this in view, our constant prayer for you is that our God may count you worthy of the call that you have received, and by his power make perfect your delight in all goodness and the efforts that have resulted from your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>Then, in the loving kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, will the name of Jesus, our Lord, be honored in you, and you in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our being gathered to meet him, we beg you, friends,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>not lightly to let your minds become unsettled, or disturbed by any revelation, or by any message, or by any letter, purporting to come from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Do not let anyone deceive you, whatever he may do. For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the appearing of that Incarnation of Wickedness, that the Lost soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who so opposes himself to everyone that is spoken of as a God or as an object of worship, and so exalts himself above them, that he seats himself in the Temple of God, and displays himself as God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do not you remember how, when I was with you, I used to speak to you of all this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And you know now what the restraining influence is which prevents his appearing before his appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>Wickedness, indeed, is already at work in secret; but only until he who at present restrains it is removed out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>Then will ‘Wickedness Incarnate’ appear, but the Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his lips, and annihilate him by the splendor of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>For at the coming of the Lord there will be great activity on the part of Satan, in the form of all kinds of deceptive miracles, signs, and marvels, as well as of wicked attempts to delude —</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>to the ruin of those who are on the path to destruction, because they have never received and loved the truth to their own salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>That is why God places them under the influence of a delusion, to cause them to believe a lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>so that sentence may be passed on all those who refuse to believe the truth, but delight in wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But, friends, whom the Lord loves, it is our duty always to thank God about you, for, from the first, God chose you for salvation through the purifying influence of the Spirit, and your belief in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>To this you were called by the good news which we brought you, to attain to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Stand firm then, friends, and hold fast to the truths that we taught you, whether by word or by letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and, in his loving kindness, gave us unfailing consolation and good ground for hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>console your hearts, and strengthen you to do and to say all that is right.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>In conclusion, friends, pray for us — pray that the Lord’s message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honor, as it was among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people — for it is not everyone who believes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord will not fail you; he will give you strength, and guard you from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it. Night and day, laboring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was — ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>We hear that there are among you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>All such people we beg, and implore,, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
