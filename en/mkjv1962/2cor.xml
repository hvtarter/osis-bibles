      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace [be] unto you, and peace from God our Father and [from the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>He comforting us in all our trouble, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in every trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>And if we are troubled, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, being worked out in [the] endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer; if we are comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope of you [is] certain, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For, brothers, we would not have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength; so much so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, so that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that He will yet deliver [us] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>with you also helping together by prayer for us, so that the gracious gift by many persons be [the cause of] thanksgiving through many for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity; not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God; we have had our conduct in the world, and more abundantly toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you than what you read or recognize, and I trust you shall recognize them even to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>even as you have recognized us [in] part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you before, so that you might have a second benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and to be brought on my way toward Judea by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Then purposing this, did I indeed use lightness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose them according to the flesh, so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But [as] God [is] true, our word toward you was not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us; by me and Silas and Timothy; was not yes and no, but in Him was, yes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of God in Him [are] yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>But He confirming us and anointing us with you in Christ [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>And He has sealed us and having given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>And I call God [as] witness to my soul that in order to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come to you again in grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorry, who then is he who makes me glad, but the same who has been made sorry by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this to you, lest when I came I should have sorrow from the [ones] of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much trouble and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, except in part; so that I not overbear all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>This punishment by the majority [is] enough for such a one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overwhelming sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>So I beseech you to confirm [your] love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>But to whom you forgive anything, I also [forgive]. For if I forgave anything, for your sakes I forgave [it] to him in the person of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>so that we should not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>And, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by [the] Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother. But taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks [be] to God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and He revealing through us the odor of the knowledge of Him in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in those being saved, and in those being lost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to the one [we are] the savor of death to death, and to the other we are the savor of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as many, hawking the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, like some, epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>[it] having been made plain that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, not having been written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but in fleshly tablets of [the] heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And we have such trust through Christ toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency [is] of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also has made us able ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministry of death, having been engraved in letters in stone was with glory (so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses because of the glory of his face), which was being done away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>shall not the ministry of the Spirit be with more glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation [is] glorious, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which has been done away [was] glorious, much more that which remains [is] glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Then since we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>And we are not like Moses, [who] put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of the thing being done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>(But their thoughts were blinded; for until the present the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant, not taken away.) But this veil has been done away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But whenever it turns to [the] Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>And the Lord [is] that Spirit; and where the Spirit of [the] Lord [is], there [is] liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with [our] face having been unveiled, having beheld the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, are being changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the Word of God, but [by] the revelation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But also if our gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those being lost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving ones, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ (who is the image of God) should not dawn on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For [it is] God who said, Out of darkness Light shall shine; who shone in our hearts to [give] the brightness of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>in every [way] having been troubled, but not having been hemmed in; having been perplexed, but not utterly at a loss;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>having been persecuted, but not having been forsaken; having been thrown down, but not having been destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always bearing about the dying of the Lord Jesus in the body, so that the life of Jesus also might be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always being delivered to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus might also be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>For we, having the same spirit of faith (according as it is written, I believed, and therefore I have spoken); we also believed and therefore speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus shall also raise us up by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things [are] for your sake, so that the superabounding grace might be made to abound through the thanksgiving of the greater number, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>For this cause we do not faint; but though our outward man perishes, yet the inward [man] is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For the lightness of our present affliction works out for us a far more excellent eternal weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>we not considering the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen; for the things which [are] seen [are] not lasting, but the things which [are] not seen [are] everlasting.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For indeed in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling-place out of Heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed [in] being clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in [this] tabernacle groan, being burdened; inasmuch as we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be clothed, so that the mortal might be swallowed up by the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>And He who has worked in us for this same thing [is] God, who also [is] giving to us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Then being always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>for we walk by faith, not by sight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>then we are confident and we are pleased rather to go away from home out of the body, and to come home to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we are also laboring to be well-pleasing to Him, whether at home or away from home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive the things done] through the body, according to that which he has done, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men. But we are revealed to God, and I trust also that we are revealed in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but are giving you occasion to glory on our behalf, so that you may have [it] to [answer] those boasting in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are out of our mind, [it is] to God; or [if] we are in our senses, [it is] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constrains us, judging this, that if one died for all, then all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and He died for all, that the living ones may live no more to themselves, but to Him who died for them and having been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So as we now know no one according to flesh, but even if we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we no longer know [Him so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>So that if any one [is] in Christ, [that one is] a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things [are] of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>whereas God was in Christ reconciling [the] world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and putting the word of reconciliation in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Then we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as God exhorting through us, we beseech [you] on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For He has made Him who knew no sin, [to be] sin for us, that we might become [the] righteousness of God in Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>But working together, we also call on you not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(For He says, In an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation, I helped you; Behold, now [is] the accepted time. Behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>[We are] in nothing giving cause of stumbling, in no way, so that the ministry may not be blamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves as God's servants, in much patience, in troubles, in emergencies, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right [hand] and on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and [yet] true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown and [yet] well known; as dying and, behold, we live; as chastened and not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, [yet] possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians, our mouth is opened to you, our heart has been enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restrained in us, but you are restrained in your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>But for the same reward, (I speak as to children), you also be enlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not be unequally yoked together [with] unbelievers; for what fellowship does righteousness [have] with lawlessness? And what partnership does light [have] with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement does Christ [have] with Belial? Or what part does a believer [have] with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement does a temple of God [have] with idols? For you are the temple of [the] living God, as God has said, I will dwell in them and walk among [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore come out from among them and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch the unclean [thing]. And I will receive you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says [the] Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Then having these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Make room for us. We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we overreached no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not speak [this] to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for [us] to die together, and to live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>My boldness of speech [is] great toward you; my glorying on your behalf [is] much. I have been filled with comfort, I am overflowing with joy on all our trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For, indeed, coming into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but being troubled in every way, [with] fightings [on the] outside, and fears [on the] inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But He who comforts the lowly comforted us by the coming of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>And not only by his coming, but by the comfort with which he was comforted over you, telling us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For even if I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret; if indeed I did regret; for I see that that letter grieved you for an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you grieved to repentance. For you were grieved according to God, so that you might suffer loss by nothing in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For the grief according to God works repentance to salvation, not to be regretted, but the grief of the world works out death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold this same thing (you being grieved according to God); how much it worked out earnestness in you; but [also] defense; but [also] indignation; but [also] fear; but [also desire; but [also] zeal; but  also] vengeance! In everything you approved yourselves to be clear in the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Then, though I wrote to you, [it was] not on account of the one who did wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered wrong, but for the sake of revealing our earnestness on your behalf, for you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort, and we rather rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>For if I have boasted anything about you to him, I was not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting as to Titus became truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his tender feelings are more abundant toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, as you received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>And, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given among the churches of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in much testing of trouble, the overflowing of their joy, and the depth of their poverty, abounded to the riches of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I testify [that] according to [their] ability, and beyond their ability; [they] gave willingly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>with much beseeching, begging us [that they might] receive of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And not as we hoped, but first [they] gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through [the] will of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>for us to call on Titus, that even as he began before, so he would also complete this grace to you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But even as you abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us; you should abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I do not speak according to command, but through the eagerness of others, and testing the trueness of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor, in order that you might be made rich through His poverty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give [my] judgment; for this is profitable for you, who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now also finish the doing [of it], so that, as [there was] a readiness to will, so also the finishing, [giving] out of [what] you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the eagerness is present, [it is] acceptable according to [what] one has, [and] not according to [what] one does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For [it is] not that others may [have] ease, but you trouble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but by equality in the present time; your abundance for their need, that their abundance also may be for your need; so that there may be equality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>as it is written, He [gathering] much, he had nothing left over; and he [gathering] little did not have less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks [be] to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For indeed he accepted the entreaty. But being more earnest, of his own accord he went to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent with him the brothers whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only [so], but also he having been chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and [as a witness of] your eager mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>providing for honest things, not only before [the] Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest by the great confidence which [I have] in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If anyone inquires of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow-worker for you, or [of] our brothers, [they are] the messengers of the churches, [the] glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show them a proof of your love and of our boasting toward you in the presence of the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For indeed regarding the ministry to the saints, it is not necessary for me to write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your eagerness, of which I boast to Macedonia on your behalf, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has aroused the greater number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I sent the brothers, lest our boasting (which [is] on your behalf) should not be in vain, that, as I said, you may be ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>[I say this] lest perhaps Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared. We (not to say you) would then be put to shame in this confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought [it] necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go forward to you, and make up beforehand your blessing, it having been promised that this would be ready, thus as  a matter of] blessing, and not as of covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But [I say] this, He who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Each one, as he purposes in his heart, [let him give]; not of grief, or of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you, that in everything, always having all self-sufficiency, you may abound to every good work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>As it is written, He scattered; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, may He supply and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>you being enriched in everything to all generosity, which works out thanksgiving to God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the ministry of this service not only supplies the things lacking of the saints, but also multiplying through many thanksgivings to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>through the proof of this ministry [they] glorify God for your freely expressed submission to the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of the fellowship toward them and toward all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and [in] their prayer for you, who long after you, because of the exceeding grace of God on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks [be] to God for His unspeakable free gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>And I myself, Paul, beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ; I, who indeed to look upon [am] lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I ask, not being present, that I may be bold with the confidence which I think to be daring against some, who thought [of] us as walking according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though walking about in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>pulling down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and having readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look at things according to appearance? If anyone has persuaded himself that he [is] Christ's, let him think this again as to himself, that as he [is] Christ's, even so we [are] Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I also should boast somewhat more fully of our authority (which the Lord has given us for building up, and not for pulling you down) I will not be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>so that I might not seem to terrify you by letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For indeed they say, the letters [are] weighty and powerful, but the bodily presence [is] weak, and his speech is contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a one think this, that, such as we [are] in word by letters, being absent, such [we will be] also in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we do not dare to rank or compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves. But they, measuring themselves among themselves, and comparing themselves to themselves, are not perceptive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure distributed to us, to reach even to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not overstretch ourselves as [though] not reaching to you. For we also came to you in the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting beyond measure in the labors of others, but having hope that the growing faith among you will be increased according to our rule, to overflowing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to preach the gospel in that beyond you, and not to boast in another's rule in things made ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he who glories, let him glory in [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I would that you were bearing with me a little in foolishness; but indeed bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous [over] you with godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one Man, to present [you as] a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if, indeed, the [one] coming proclaims another Jesus, whom we have not proclaimed, or [if] you receive another spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you never accepted, you might well endure [these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I judge [myself] to have come behind the highest apostles [in] nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if [I am] unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in every way [I] have been clearly revealed to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I stripped other churches, taking wages for the serving of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And being present with you, and in need, I was not a burden to anyone. For the brothers from Macedonia made up completely my need. And in every way I have kept myself from being burdensome [to you], and I will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>The truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, that I will do, so that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion; so that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such ones [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>Did not even Satan marvelously transform himself into an angel of light?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, Let no one think me foolish. If otherwise, yet receive me as foolish, so that I may also boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this boldness of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many glory according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you gladly bear with fools, being wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you endure if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours, if anyone takes [from you], if anyone exalts himself, if anyone strikes you in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak according to dishonor, as though we have been weak. But in whatever anyone dares (I speak foolishly), I also dare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? I also! Are they Israelites? I also! Are they the seed of Abraham? I also!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as beside myself,) I [am] more! [I have been] in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more, in deaths many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Five times from the Jews I received forty [stripes] minus one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day in the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>I have been in travels often; in dangers from waters; in dangers from robbers; in dangers from [my] race; in dangers from [the] heathen; in dangers in [the] city; in dangers in [ the] wilderness; in dangers on [the sea; in dangers among false brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>[I have been] in hardship and toil; often in watchings; in hunger and thirst; often in fastings; in cold and nakedness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>besides the things outside conspiring against me daily, the care of all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If it is right to boast, I will boast [of] the things of my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of [the] Damascenes, desiring to lay hold of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>And I was let down in a basket through a window through the wall, and escaped their hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>Indeed, it is not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ fourteen years before (whether in [the] body, I do not know; or outside of [the] body, I do not know; God knows) such a one [was] caught up to [the] third Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>I will glory of such a one, yet I will not boast on my behalf, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I desire to boast, I shall not be foolish. For I will speak the truth. But I spare, lest anyone should think of me as [being] beyond what he sees me, or hears of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>and by the surpassing revelations, lest I be made haughty, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be made haughty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may overshadow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I am pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become foolish boasting. You compelled me. For I ought to be commended by you. For I lacked nothing of the highest apostles, if even I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in miracles and in wonders, and by works of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is it in which you were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, a third [time] I am ready to come to you. And I will not burden you, for I do not seek your things, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls, even if loving you more and more, I am loved [the] less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But let it be so, I did not burden you. But being crafty, I caught you with bait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>By any whom I have sent to you, did I overreach you by him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I begged Titus and sent with [him] the brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we] not walk] in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do you think we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear, lest somehow coming I might not find you as I wish, and [that] I shall be found by you such as you might not wish; lest somehow [there be] strifes, envyings, angers, contentions, backbitings, whisperings, proud thoughts, tumults;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest in my coming again my God will humble me with you; and I shall mourn many who have already sinned, and not repenting over the uncleanness, and fornication, and lustfulness which they have practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>I am coming to you this third [time]. In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I told you before, and I say beforehand, as being present the second [time] and being absent now. I write to those who sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (who is not weak toward you, but is powerful in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>for even if He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by [the] power of God. For indeed even we are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by [the] power of God toward you),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith, prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are reprobates?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>But I pray to God [for] you not to do evil, none. And not that we may appear approved, but that you should do the good things, though we are deemed to be reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we have no power against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we are glad when we are weak, and you are powerful. But we pray also for this, your perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore I write these things while absent, lest being present I may not deal sharply [with you] according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally, brothers, rejoice. Perfect yourselves; encourage yourselves; mind the same thing; be at peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints greet you.</verse>
