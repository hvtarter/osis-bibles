        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, so that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might he fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>So says Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of Heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. And He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Who [is there] among you of all His people? Let his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah God of Israel (He is God) which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whoever remains in any place where he resides, let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with animals, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>And the chiefs of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, and all whose spirit God had raised, rose up to go up to build the house of the LORD which [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month had come, and the sons of Israel [were] in the cities, the people gathered themselves as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>And Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers. And they built the altar of the God of Israel in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as [it is] written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar on its bases, for fear [was] on them because of the people of those countries. And they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings both morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as [it is] written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And afterward they [offered] the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were set apart, and of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>They gave silver also to the masons and to the carpenters. And they gave meat and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and to the people of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began. And they chose the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>And Jeshua stood up together [with] his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, to set forward the workmen in the house of God the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their robes with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, because [He is] good, for His mercy [endures] forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, ancient men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. And many shouted aloud for joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not tell the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people. For the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>And when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity built the temple to the LORD God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, even as you. And we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God. But we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And they hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of their companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. And the letter [was] written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the judges, and the emissaries, the consuls, the officials, the Erechites, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest of [the province] Beyond the River, and now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>this [is] the copy of the letter which they sent to him, to Artaxerxes the king. Your servants the men of the province Beyond the River, and so now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem, and are building the rebellious and the evil city, and have set up [its] walls, and have joined the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>And let it be known to the king that if this city is built and the walls set up, then they will not pay toll, taxes, or custom, and you shall endanger the revenue of the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>And because we have eaten the salt of the palace, and it was not right for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and notified the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>so that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers, and you shall find in the book of the records, and shall know that [this] city [is] a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have rebelled in it in the past, for which cause that city was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We notify the king that if this city is built and the walls of it set up, then you shall have no portion Beyond the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The message the king sent to Rehum the chancellor, and [to] Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and to the rest Beyond the River, Peace! And now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city has lifted up itself against kings in the past, and rebellion and revolt have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all Beyond the River. And toll, taxes, and custom was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Now make a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built until the decree shall be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>And take heed that you do not fail to do this. Why should damage grow to the hurt of [the] kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>And when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter [was] read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they hurried to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them stop by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then the work of the house of God at Jerusalem ceased. So it ceased to the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, [who was] over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God at Jerusalem. And with them [were] the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time Tatnai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, came to them and said this to them Who has commanded you to build this house and to make this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>So then we said to them: What [are] the names of the men who are building this building?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, so that they could not cause them to stop until the matter came to Darius, and answer by letter concerning this had been returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter which Tatnai, governor of [the province] Beyond the River, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions, the officials Beyond the River, sent to Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent a letter to him, in which this was written, To Darius the king, all peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is being built [with] great stones, and timber is being laid in the walls, and this work goes on fast and is blessed in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders [and] said this to them, Who commanded you to build this house and to make these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We also asked their names in order to notify you so that we might write the names of the men who are the chief of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>and they returned this answer to us, saying, We are the servants of the God of Heaven and earth. And we build the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.</verse>
