        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, in regard to all things I pray [that] you prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when [the] brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than these things, to hear that my children walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who in love bore witness of you before [the] church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because they went forth for His name's sake, taking nothing from the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>Therefore we ought to entertain such, so that we might be co-workers in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, ranting against us with evil words. And not content [with] these, neither does he himself receive the brothers. And he forbids those who would, and casts [them] out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate the bad, but the good. He who does good is from God, but he who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has good report by all, and by the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I will not write to you with pen and ink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>but I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace [be] to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
