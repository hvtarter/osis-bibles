  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through [the] will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called out with all those in every place who call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace [be] to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf [for] the grace of God given you in Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you are enriched by Him, [in] all speech and in all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>He shall also confirm you to [the] end, [that you may be] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God [is] faithful, by whom you were called to [the] fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>But I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, [that] you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>But I say this, that every one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides these, I do not know if I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel; not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, [it is] the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the perceiving ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where [is the] wise? Where [is the] scribe? Where [is the] lawyer of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world [by] wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But to them, the called-out ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is] the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men according to the flesh [are called], not many mighty, not many noble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and God has chosen the base things of the world, and things which are despised, and things which are not, in order to bring to nothing things that are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no flesh should glory in His presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that, according as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in [the] Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the] Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>so that your faith should not stand in [the] wisdom of men, but in [the] power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>But, we speak wisdom among those who are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, that come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak [the] wisdom of God in a mystery, which God has hidden, predetermining it before the world for our glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this world knew (for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed [them] to us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of man within him? So also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>These things we also speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the] Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not receive the things of [the] Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly, as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I have fed you with milk and not with solid food, for you were not yet able [to bear it]; nor are you able even now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For you are yet carnal. For in that [there is] among you envyings and strife and divisions, are you not carnal, and [do you not] walk according to men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are you not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he who plants anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>So he planting, and he watering, are one, and each one shall receive [his] own reward according to [his] own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For of God we are fellow-workers, a field of God, and you are a building of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds [on it]. But let every man be careful how he builds [on it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For any other foundation can no one lay than the one] being laid, who is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each one's work shall be revealed. For the Day shall declare [it], because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try each one's work as to what kind it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone's work which he built remains, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone's work shall be burned up, he shall suffer loss. But he shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool so that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again,  The] Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether it is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>So let a man think of us as ministers of Christ and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>And the rest, it is sought among stewards that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a man's day; but I do not judge my own self,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>for I know nothing by myself. Yet I have not been justified by this, but He who judges me is [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. And then shall each one have praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>And these things, brothers, I have [in a figure] transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, so that no one of you may [be] puffed up against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you to differ [from another]? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive [it], why do you boast as [if you] had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are full! Already you are rich! You have reigned [as kings] without us! And oh that indeed you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has set forth us last, the apostles, as it were appointed to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We [are] fools for Christ's sake, but you [are] wise in Christ. We [are] weak, but you [are] strong. You [are] honorable, but we [are] despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even until this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all [things] until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers; for I have begotten you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I beseech you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved son and faithful in [the] Lord, who shall remind you [of] my ways which are] in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>As to my not coming to you now, some are puffed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills. And I will not know the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or [in] love and the spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>On the whole it is reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the nations, so as one to have [his] father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, so that he who has done this deed may be taken from your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For as being absent in body but present in spirit, I indeed have judged already [as though I were] present [concerning] him who worked out this thing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, with my spirit; also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting [is] not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Therefore purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep [the] feast; not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in the letter not to associate intimately with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you must go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to associate intimately, if any man called a brother [and is] either a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one not to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what [is it] to me to also judge those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But God judges those who are outside. Therefore put out from you the evil one.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Do any of you dare, when you have a matter against another, to go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to mention the things] of this] life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If, then, you truly have judgments of [the things] of this] life, set those who are least esteemed in the church [to judge].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>For I speak to your shame. [Is it] so [that] there is not a wise one among you, not even one in your midst who shall be able to judge between his brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Indeed then there is already on the whole a failure among you, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you do wrong and defraud, and these things to brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you. But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them. But the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord is for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God has both raised up the Lord, and also will raise us up by His own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] the members of a harlot? Let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, The two shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against [his] own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have of God? And you are not your own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning what you wrote to me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But, because of the fornications, let each have his [own] wife, and let each have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband give to the wife proper kindness, and likewise the wife also to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over [her] own body, but the husband. And likewise also the husband does not have authority [over his] own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another, unless [it is] with consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. And come together again so that Satan does not tempt you for your incontinence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I speak this according to permission, not according to commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I would that all men were even as I myself am. But each has his proper gift from God, one according to this manner and another according to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if she is indeed separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband. And a husband is not to leave [his] wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I speak, not the Lord, If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is pleased to dwell with him, do not let him put her away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>The wife and the virgin [are] different. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please [her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is right, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if anyone thinks [it] behaving himself indecently toward his virgin (if she is past [her] prime, and so it ought to be) let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But [he] who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but who has authority over [his] own will (and has so judged in his heart that he will keep his virginity) he does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who gives in marriage does well. But he who does not give in marriage does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives, but if her husband sleeps in death, she is at liberty to be remarried to whom she will, only in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If all the body [were] an eye, where [would be] the hearing? If all hearing, where [would be] the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body as it has pleased Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if they were all one member, where [would be] the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now indeed many [are] the members, yet only one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those [members] of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we put more abundant honor around [them]. And our unpresentable [members] have more abundant propriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>For our presentable [members] have no need, but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the [member] having need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>that there not be division in the body, but [that] the members should have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with [it]; if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>And you are the body of Christ, and members in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God set some in the church, firstly, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers, then works of power, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>[Are] all apostles? [Are] all prophets? [Are] all teachers? [Are] all workers of power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak languages? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But zealously strive after the better gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I have become [as] sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have prophecies, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so as to move mountains, and do not have charity, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I give out all my goods to feed the poor], and though I deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am profited nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Charity has patience, is kind; charity is not envious, is not vain, is not puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>does not behave indecently, does not seek her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Charity does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Charity never fails. But if [there are] prophecies, they will be abolished; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I did away with the things of an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know even as I also am fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now faith, hope, charity, these three remain; but the greatest of these [is] charity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after charity and desire spiritual [things], but rather that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. For no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks to men [for] building up, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy; for greater [is] he prophesying than he speaking in tongues, unless he interpret so that the church may receive building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what [is] being said? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>So it may be many kinds of sounds are in [the] world, and not one [is] without a distinct sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore if I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to him speaking, and he speaking [will be] a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>Even so you, since you are zealots of spiritual [things], seek to build up the church, in order that you may abound</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>So then he speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Else, if you bless in the spirit, he occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God [that] I speak more languages than all of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>yet in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, so that I might also teach others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, By other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and even so they will not hear Me, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So that tongues are not a sign to those who believe, but to those who do not believe. But prophesying [is] not to those who do not believe, but to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Therefore if the whole church has come together, and all speak in languages, and if uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And so the secrets of his heart become revealed. And so, falling down on [his] face, he will worship God and report that God is truly among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>Then how is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If one speaks in a language, [let it be] by two, or [at] the most three, and in succession. And let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in a church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>And [if there are] two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If [a revelation] is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you may all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets [are] subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let your women be silent in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as the Law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So then, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>And, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Afterward He was seen by over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain until this present day, but also some fell asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all He was seen by me also, as one born out of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles and am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which [was] toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore whether [it was] I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from [the] dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation [is] worthless, and your faith [is] also worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And we are also found [to be] false witnesses of God, because we testified of God that He raised Christ; whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if [the] dead are not raised, then Christ is not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ is not raised, your faith [is] foolish; you are yet in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has risen from [the] dead, [and] has become the firstfruit of those who slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since death [is] through man, the resurrection of [the] dead also [is] through a Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in [his] own order: Christ the first-fruit, and afterward they who are Christ's at His coming;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>then [is] the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>for it is right for Him to reign until He has put all the enemies under His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy made to cease [is] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For He put all things under His feet. But when He says that all things have been put under [His feet], it is plain that [it] excepts Him who has put all things under Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subject to Him who has subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all things in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of [the] dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of [the] dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>Day by day I die, by your rejoicing, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what advantage is to me if [the] dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived; evil companionships corrupt good habits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Be righteously awake, and sin not; for some have ignorance of God. I speak [this] to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow, you do not sow the body that [is] going to be, but a bare grain (perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>And God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to each of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh [is] not the same flesh; but one [kind of] flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>[There are] also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly [is] truly different, and that of the earthly different;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>one glory of [the] sun, and another glory of [the] moon, and another glory of [the] stars; for [one] star differs from [another] star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>And so it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul, the last Adam was a life-giving Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man [was] out of earth, earthy; the second Man [was] the Lord from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Such the earthy [man], such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly [Man], such also the heavenly ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And according as we bore the image of the earthy [man], we shall also bear the image of the heavenly [Man].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit [the] kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I speak a mystery to you; we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet. For a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and when this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death, where [is] your sting? O grave, where [is] your victory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death [is] sin, and the strength of sin [is] the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks [be] to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So that, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.</verse>
