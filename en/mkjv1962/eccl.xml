      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What [is] the profit to a man in all his labor which he labors under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>A generation passes away, and a generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goes toward the south, and it turns around to the north; it whirls around continually; and the wind returns on its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; to the place from where the rivers come, there they return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things [are] full of labor; man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which has been [is] that which shall be; and that which has been done [is] that which shall be done; and [there is] nothing new under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there a thing [of] which it may be said, See, this [is] new? It has already been in days of old, which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>[There is] no memory of former [things], and also no memory] of after [things] which shall be; for neither shall be a remembrance of them with those who will be at the afterwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all which is done under the heavens. [It is] a sad task God has given to the sons of men to be humbled by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>What [is] crooked cannot be made straight; and [that] lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I spoke within my own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have gathered more wisdom than all that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart has seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I know that this also [is] vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom [is] much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore consider and behold goodness; this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, [It is] madness; and of mirth, What does it do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought in my heart to drag my flesh with wine, yet leading my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might see where the good for the sons of men might be, what they should do under the heavens all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made my works great; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made gardens and orchards for myself, And I planted trees in them, of all fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made pools of water for myself, to water the forest shooting forth trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I bought slaves and slave women, and sons of the house were mine; also livestock, a herd and a great flock were mine, above all that were before me in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I also gathered silver and gold to myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and very many wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my part of all my labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit; and [there is] no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] who comes after the king, when they have already done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man's eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also knew that one event happens to all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, [so] it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For [there is] no memory of the wise [more than] of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise die above the fool!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun [is] sad to me; for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knows [whether] he shall be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>And I turned to cause my heart to despair over all the labor which I did under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>When there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet to a man who has not labored in it, he shall leave it [for] his share. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what has man from all his labor, and from the troubling of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days [are] sorrows, and his labor sadness; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>Is it not good that he should eat and drink and make his soul see good in his labor? This I also saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For [God] gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who [is] good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him who is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>To every thing [there is] a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pull up what [is] planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit does he have who works in that in which he labors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men to be humbled by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He has made everything beautiful in His time; also He has set eternity in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that [there is] no good in them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it [is] the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God does [it] so that they fear before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which has been is now; and that which [is] to be has already been; and God requires that which is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And again I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, that wickedness [was] there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the matter of sons of men, that God might reveal them, and that they might see that they themselves [are] beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which happens [to] the sons of men also happens to beasts even one thing [happens] to them. As this [one] dies, so that [one] dies; yea, they all [have] one breath; so that a man has no advantage over a beast; for all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows the spirit of man [that] goes upward, and the spirit of the beast [that] goes downward?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Therefore I have seen that [there is] nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion; for who can bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold the tears of the oppressed ones, and they had no comforter! And on the side of those who oppressed them there [was] power, but they had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>And I commended the dead who already have died, more than the living who [are] living now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Yea, better than both [is he] who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all labor, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better [is] a hand filled with rest than two fists [with] travail and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he has neither son nor brother; yet there is no end to all his labor; and his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and [he says, For whom do I labor and take good from my soul? This [is] also vanity. Yes, it [is] an evil business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him [who is] alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two lie [together], then they have warmth; but how can one be warm [alone] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And if one overthrows him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>A poor and a wise child [is] better than an old and foolish king, who will not be warned any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For out of prison he comes to reign; although in his kingdom he was born poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child who shall stand up in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>[There is] no end of all the people, of all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools. For they do not know that they are doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Do not be rash [with] your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to say a word before God. For God [is] in Heaven, and you [are] on earth; therefore let your words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice by the multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When you vow a vow to God, do not wait to pay it. For He has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>[it is] better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; do not say before the angel that it [was] an error. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For in the multitude of dreams, both words and vanities abound; but fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter. For He [who is] higher than the highest watches; and there are some higher than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>And the advantage of a land, it is for all; [even] a king has a field being tilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver, and he who loves abundance not with] gain. This [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When the good thing increases, those who eat it increase; then what profit [is it] to its owners, except to see [it] with their eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of a laboring man [is] sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for their owners to their hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>But those riches perish by evil use. And he brings forth a son, and nothing [is] in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came forth from his mother's womb naked, he shall return to go as he came. And from his labor he may not carry anything that may go in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all, as he came, so shall he go; and what profit does he have who has labored for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>Also all his days he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath [with] his sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold that which I have seen. [it is] good and right for one to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he labors under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it [is] his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Also every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this [is] the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God answers [him] in the joy of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is] great among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>a man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a stranger eats it. This [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man fathers a hundred, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with good, and also is for him no burial; I say, a miscarriage [is] better than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For he comes in with vanity and goes out in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Also he has not seen the sun, nor known [anything]. This one has more rest than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yea, though he live twice a thousand years, yet he has seen no good. Do not all go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labor of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what [has] the wise more than the fool? What [gain has] the poor who knows [how] to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>That which has been [is] named already, and it is known that he [is] man. And he is not able to contend with Him who is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>For there are many things that increase vanity, [and] what [is] man the better?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knows what [is] good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name [is] better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>[It is] better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow [is] better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of laughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool; this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a bribe destroys the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning of it; the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Do not be hasty in your spirit to be angry; for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Do not say, Why was [it] that the former days were better than these? For you do not ask wisely in regard to this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance; but it is gain to those who see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For wisdom [is] a defense, and money [is] a defense; but the excellency of knowledge [is] that wisdom gives life to those who have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what He has made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity take note [that] God also has set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>All [things] I have seen in the days of my vanity; there is a just one who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked one who prolongs [life] in his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Do not be righteous overmuch, neither make yourself overwise; why destroy yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Do not be very wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>[It is] good that you should take hold of this; yea, also from this do not withdraw your hand; for he who fears God shall come forth from all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom makes the wise stronger than ten mighty ones who are in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>For [there is] not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also do not listen to all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>For also your own heart knows that you yourself have also cursed others many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this I have proved by wisdom; I said, I will be wise; but it [was] far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>That which is far off and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I set my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart [is] snares and nets, and her hands [like] bands. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this I have found, says the Preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out the sum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>which my soul still sought, but I find not: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all those I have not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Lo, this only I have found, that God has made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who [is] as the wise? And who knows the meaning of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I [say], keep the king's word, and [that] because of the oath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not take a stand in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>Because the word of a king [is] that which has power; and who may say to him, What are you doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whoever keeps the command shall feel no evil thing; and a wise man's heart knows both time and judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man [is] great on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he does not know what shall be; for who can tell him when it shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>[There is] no man who has power over the spirit to keep the spirit; nor power in the day of death; and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; nor shall wickedness deliver its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this I have seen, and I gave my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is] a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>And so I saw the wicked buried, and they came and went from the holy place. And they were forgotten in the city, [these] things that they had done. This [is] also vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because sentence [against] an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner does evil a hundred [times], and his [days] be made longer, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>But it shall not be well with the wicked, nor shall he make [his] days longer like a shadow; because he does not fear before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done on the earth: There are just ones to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked ones to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also [is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I praised gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be glad; for that shall go with him of his labor for the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth; for neither day nor night do men see sleep with their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>Then I looked at all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labors to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find it. Yea, further, though a wise one speaks of knowing, yet he shall not be able to find [it].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For all this I took to heart, even to make all this clear, that the righteous and the wise and their works [are] in the hand of God. No man knows either love or hatred [by] all [that is] before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All [happens] alike to all; [there is] one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice. As [is] the good, so is the sinner. He who swears is as [he] who fears an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This [is] an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event to all. Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For whoever is chosen, to all those living, there is hope; for a living dog [is] better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they shall die; but the dead do not know anything, nor do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; nor do they any longer have a part forever in all that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God now is pleased with your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Look [on] life with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity. For that [is] your share in [this life, and in your labor which you labor under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever your hand finds to do, do [it] with all your might; for [there is] no work, nor plan, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave where you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned and saw under the sun that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also does not know his time; as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so [are] the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>This wisdom I have seen also under the sun, and it [seemed] great to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>[There was] a little city, and few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, and built huge bulwarks against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>And a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>And I said, Wisdom [is] better than strength; but the poor man's wisdom [is] despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise [are] heard in quiet more than the cry of him who rules among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom [is] better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>As dead flies cause the perfumer's ointment to stink [and] ferment; [so] a little folly [is more] rare than wisdom and] than honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A man's heart [is] at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Yes also, in the way a fool walks, his heart fails; and he says to all [that] he [is] a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place; for yielding quiets great sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like a sin which comes from a ruler's presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>foolishness is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants on horses and princes walking as servants on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He who digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks a hedge, a snake shall bite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoever removes stones shall be hurt with them. He who splits wood shall be endangered by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the iron is blunt, and he does not whet the edge, then he must put more strength to [it]. But wisdom [is] profitable to direct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>Surely the snake will bite without enchantment; and a babbler [is] no better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise mouth [are] gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness; and the end of his talk [is] wicked madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>A fool also makes many words; a man knows not what they shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labor of fools wearies him, because he does not know [how] to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to you, O land, when your king [is] a child and your leaders eat in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Blessed [are] you, O land, when your king [is] the son of nobles, and your leaders eat in [due] time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By slothfulness the building decays; and through lowering of the hands the house leaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>Bread [is] made for laughter, and wine makes merry; but silver answers all [things].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Do not curse a king, no, not in your thought; and do not curse the rich in your bedroom; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.11'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a share to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty on the earth; and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He who watches the wind shall not sow; and he who pays attention to the clouds shall not reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As you do not know what [is] the way of the spirit, as how the bones [grow] in the pregnant woman's womb; even so you do not know the works of God who makes all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.6'>In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know what shall be blessed, either this or that, or whether they both [shall be] fruitful in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.7'>Also the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant thing [it is] for the eyes to behold the sun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.8'>but if a man lives many years, [and] rejoices in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that comes [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.9'>Rejoice, in your youth, young man; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these [things] God will bring you into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.10'>Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for childhood and prime of life [are] vanity.</verse>
