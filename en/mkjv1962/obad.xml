      <chapter osisID='Obad.1'>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.1'>The vision of Obadiah. So says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard a message from the LORD, and a messenger is sent among the nations: Rise up, even let us rise up against her for battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.2'>Behold, I have given you [to be] small among the nations; you are greatly despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.3'>The pride of your heart has deceived you, dwelling in the clefts of the rock, his dwelling [is] lofty; saying in his heart, Who shall bring me down [to] the ground?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.4'>Though you rise high like the eagle, and though [you] set your nest between the stars, I will bring you down from there, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.5'>If thieves came to you, if destroyers by night (how you have been cut off!), would they not have stolen until they had enough? If the grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.6'>How Esau is searched out! His hidden things are sought out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.7'>All the men of your covenant have dismissed you to the border; the men who were at peace with you have deceived you, [and] have overcome you. They are setting your bread as a snare under you; [there is] no understanding in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.8'>Shall I not in that day even destroy the wise out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau, says the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.9'>And your mighty ones, O] Teman, shall be afraid, so that each man from the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.10'>Shame shall cover you from the violence against your brother Jacob, and you shall be cut off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.11'>On the day of your standing on the other [side], on the day that the strangers were capturing his force, and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you [were] like one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>But you should not have looked on the day of your brother on the day of his alienation; nor should you have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their ruin; nor should you have enlarged your mouth in the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>You should not have entered into the gate of My people in the day of their calamity; also, you should not have looked on his evil in the day of their calamity. Nor should you have sent out against his force in the day of his calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.14'>Nor should you have stood on the crossways to cut off those of him who escaped; nor should you have shut up his survivors in the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.15'>For the day of the LORD [is] near on all the nations; as you have done, it shall be done to you. Your reward shall return upon your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.16'>For as you have drunk upon My holy mountain, [so] all the nations shall drink forever. Yes, they shall drink, and they shall swallow, and they shall be as [though] they had not been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.17'>But upon Mount Zion shall be those who escaped; and it shall be holy. And the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.18'>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame. And the house of Esau [shall be] for stubble. And they shall kindle in them and burn them up. And no survivor shall be to the house of Esau; for the LORD has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.19'>And [those of] the south shall possess the mountain of Esau and the low country of the Philistines. And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria; and Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.20'>And the exiles of this army [shall go] to the sons of Israel who shall possess [the land] of the Canaanites to Zarephath; even the exiles of Jerusalem who [are] in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.21'>And deliverers shall go up into the mountain of Zion to judge the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom shall be to the LORD.</verse>
