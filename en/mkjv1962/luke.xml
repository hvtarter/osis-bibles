      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many took in hand to draw up an account concerning the matters which have been borne out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>even as those who from [the] beginning delivered to us, becoming eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, following all things accurately from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you might know the certainty of those things in which you have been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>In the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of [the] course of Abijah. And his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it happened in his serving in the order of his course, before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priests, it was his lot to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel [of the] Lord appeared to him as he was standing on [the] right of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And seeing [this], Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias. For your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall neither drink wine nor strong drink. And he shall be filled with [the] Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to [the] Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before Him in [the] spirit and power of Elijah, to turn [the] hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to [the] wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old, and my wife is advanced in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God. And I am sent to speak to you and to show you these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias and marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them. And they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And as soon as the days of his service were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>So the Lord has dealt with me in the days in which He looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of [the] house of David. And the virgin's name [was] Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came in to her and said, Hail, [one] receiving grace, the Lord [is] with you. Blessed [are] you among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And when she saw [him], she was troubled at his saying, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold! You shall conceive in [your] womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great and shall be called the Son of [the] Highest. And the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I do not know a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come on you, and [the] power of [the] Highest shall overshadow you. Therefore also that Holy [One] which will be born of you shall be called Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, your cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in her old age. And this [is] the sixth month with her who [was] called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the servant of [the] Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And [she] entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it happened as Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [are] you among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And from where [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For lo, as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed [is] she who believes, for there shall be a perfecting of those things which were told her from [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For He looked on the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations shall count me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For the Mighty One has done great things for me; and holy [is] His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His mercy [is] on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has worked power with His arm, He has scattered the proud in [the] imagination of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down rulers from [their] seats and exalted the lowly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled [the] hungry with good things, and He has sent away [the] rich empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of [His] mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth [for] her to bear. And she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard how [the] Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it Zacharias, after his father's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father as to how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosened]. And he spoke and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all who lived all around them. And all these things were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard laid [them] up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child shall this be! And the hand of [the] Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed [is the] Lord, the God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from eternity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that we should be saved from our enemies and from [the] hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>[the] oath which He swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>that He would grant to us, [that we], being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called the prophet of [the] Highest, for you shall go before [the] face of [the] Lord to prepare His ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through [the] tender mercy of our God; by which [the] Dayspring from on high has visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darkness and [in] the shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and became strong in spirit and was in the deserts until [the] day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it happened in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(This taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be registered, each to [his] own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee to be taxed (out of [the] city of Nazareth, into Judea, to [the] city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of [the] house and family line of David).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>And he took Mary his betrothed wife, being with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And while they were there, the days [for] her deliverance were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her son, the First-born, and wrapped Him, and laid Him in a manger-- because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And in the same country there were shepherds living in the field, keeping watch over their flock [by] night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And lo, the angel of [the] Lord came on them, and [the] glory of [the] Lord shone around them. And they were grievously afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For behold, I give to you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For to you is born today, in [the] city of David, a Savior, who is Christ [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this [is] a sign to you. You will find the babe wrapped, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of [the] heavenly host, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it happened as the angels departed from them into Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, Indeed, let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing which has happened, which the Lord made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And hurrying they came and sought out both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And seeing, they publicly told about the word spoken to them concerning this Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all those who heard marveled about the things spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these sayings, meditating in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, His name was called JESUS, [the name] called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present [Him] to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in [the] Law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to that said in the Law of [the] Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name [was] Simeon. And this man [was] just and devout, waiting for [the] Consolation of Israel. And [the] Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it happened to him, being instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see [the] Christ of [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And [as] the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>even he received Him in his arms and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now You will let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen Your Salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which You have prepared before [the] face of all the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation [to the] nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is set for [the] fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also), so that [the] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of [the] tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she [was] a widow [of] eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in at that instant gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had finished all things according to [the] Law of [the] Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when He was twelve years [old], they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And fulfilling the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey. And they looked for Him among the kinsfolk and acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they did not find Him, they turned back to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it happened that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And seeing Him, they were amazed. And His mother said to Him, Child, why have you done so to us? Behold, your father and I have looked for you, greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And He said to them, Why did you look for Me? Do you not know that I must be about My Father's [business] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And He went with them and came to Nazareth, and He was subject to them. But His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased [in] wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>And in [the] fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and  the] Trachonitus country, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests-- the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country around Jordan, proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in [the] book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying,  The] voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of [the] Lord, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be straight, and the rough ways [shall be] made smooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then he said to the crowd that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And now also the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. And he who has food, let him do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And tax-collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And the soldiers also asked of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not forcibly extort anyone, nor accuse [any] falsely. And be content with your wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts concerning John, lest perhaps he was the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered all, saying, I indeed baptize you with water, but He who is mightier than I comes, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to loose. He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch (being reproved by him on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all [the] evils which Herod had done)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into the midst, he came out of him, not harming him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word [is] this! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And rising up from the synagogue, He entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was being seized with a great fever. And they asked Him for her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And day coming on, going out, He went into a deserted place. And the crowds looked for Him and came to Him, and held Him fast, not to pass away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>And He said to them, I must proclaim the gospel, the kingdom of God, to other cities, because I was sent on this [mission] ,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>And it happened that the crowd pressed on Him to hear the word of God, He stood by the lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>And He saw two boats standing by the lake. But the fishermen had left them and were washing [their] nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And He entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, He asked him to thrust out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the people out of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And as He stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let your nets down for a haul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And answering, Simon said to Him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Yet at Your word I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And doing this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish. And their net was being torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they signaled the partners, those in the other boat, to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>And seeing, Simon Peter fell at the knees of Jesus, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the haul of fish which they had taken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also [were] James and John, [the] sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear, from now on you will be taking men alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And bringing their boats onto land, forsaking all things, they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it happened, as He was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy! And seeing Jesus, he fell on [his] face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You will, You can cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And stretching out the hand, He touched him, saying, I will! Be clean! And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the word about Him spread even more. And great crowds were coming to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But He was drawing back in the wilderness, and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it happened on one of the days, even He was teaching. And Pharisees and teachers of [the] Law were sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And  the] power of [the] Lord was there, for the curing [of] them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men carrying, on a cot, a man who was paralyzed. And they sought to bring him in and to lay [him] before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And not finding a way by [which] they might bring him in through the crowd, going up on the housetop, they let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst, before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, except God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why do you reason in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic, I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot [and] go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he rose up before them and took up [that] on which he lay. And he departed to his own house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled [with] fear, saying, We saw wonderful things today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>And after these things He went out and saw a tax-collector named Levi, sitting at the tax-office. And [He] said to him, Follow Me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made a great feast in his own house for Him. And there was a great company of tax-collectors and of others who were reclining with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax-collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are sound do not need a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to Him, Why do John's disciples fast often and make prayers, and also [the disciples] of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>But He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And He also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment. Otherwise, both the new will tear, and [the old] does not match [the] piece from the new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. Else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskin will perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>Also no one having drunk old [wine] immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.44'>For every tree is known by [its] own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth the good. And an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth the evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.46'>And why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>Whoever comes to Me and hears My words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock; and a flood occurring, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears and does not perform, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>And when He had ended all His words in the ears of the people, He entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain servant of a centurion who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to Him, begging Him that He would come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And coming to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that he was worthy, he for whom You give this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for, [they said], He loves our nation, and he has built us a synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far off from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come to You; but say a word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they who were sent, returning to the house, found the sick servant well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it happened on the next day, He went into a city called Nain. And many of His disciples and a great crowd went with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And drawing near the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And He came and touched the bier. And the ones who bore [him] stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the one who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear came on all. And they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report of Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And his disciples reported all these things to John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And John, calling near a certain two of his disciples, sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Are You He that should come, or do we look for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And coming to Him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, Are You He who should come, or do we look for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in the same hour He cured many of infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits. And He gave sight to many who were blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And answering, Jesus said to them, Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the gospel is proclaimed to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is [he] who shall not be offended in Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the people concerning John. What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed with soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in kings' palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is [he] of whom it is written, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say to you, Among [those] who are born of woman there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people and the tax-collectors who heard [Him] justified God, being baptized [with] the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>And the Lord said, To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We have played the flute to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you did not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom has been justified by all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman, a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster vial of ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>And she stood behind [Him], weeping at His feet, and she began to wash His feet with tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And [she] ardently kissed His feet and anointed [them] with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>But seeing this, the Pharisee who had invited Him, spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what kind of woman [this is] who touches him, for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And answering, Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and [the] other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And they having nothing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do [you] say will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>And answering, Simon said, I suppose that one to whom he forgave most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, yet you gave Me no water for My feet. But she has washed My feet with tears, and has wiped [them] with the hair of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave Me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss My feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I say to you, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those reclining with [Him] began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it happened afterwards, He traveled in every city and village, proclaiming and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve [were] with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and also certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to Him of their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, the one fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other fell on a rock, and sprouting, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other fell amidst thorns, and springing up with the thorns, [they] choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground and sprang up, and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when He had said these things, He cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to others I speak in parables, so that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>And the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the roadside are the ones who hear; then the Devil comes and takes the Word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock [are] the ones who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy. And these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And those which fell among thorns are the ones who, when they have heard, go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life, and do not bear to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But those on the good ground are the ones who, in an honest and good heart, having heard the Word, keep [it] and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>And no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts [it] under a couch; but he sets [it] on a lampstand so that those who enter in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret that shall not be revealed; nor secret which shall not be known and come to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore be careful how you hear. For whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>And His mother and [His] brothers came to Him. And they could not come near Him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told to Him [by some], who said, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside desiring to see You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>And He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are those who hear the Word of God and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>And it happened on a certain day that He went into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake. And they were being filled [with water] and were in jeopardy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to Him and awakened Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And He going out onto land, He met a certain man out of the city, who had had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, nor stayed in a house, but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him and said with a loud voice, What is to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beseech You, Do not torment me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had seized him. And he had been kept bound in chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven into the deserted [places] by the demons.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into them. And He allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And coming out of the man, the demons entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And those feeding [the pigs], and seeing the thing, fled. And leaving, [they] reported to the city and to the farms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And they went out to see what had been done. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Also those who saw [it] told them how the demon-possessed one was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear, and asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>And the man out of whom the demons had gone out begged Him, [desiring] to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to your own house and declare what God has done to you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout all the city what [great] things Jesus had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it happened when Jesus had returned, the people received Him. For they were all waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, a man named Jairus came, and he was a synagogue-ruler. And he fell down at Jesus' feet and begged Him that He would come into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went, the people thronged Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who had a flow of blood twelve years (who had spent all her living on physicians, [and] could not be healed by any)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came behind [Him] and touched the border of His garment. And instantly her flow of blood was staunched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who touched Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowd presses and jostles You, and You say, Who touched Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>And Jesus said, Someone has touched Me, for I know that power has gone out of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling. And falling down before Him, she declared to Him before all the people why she had touched Him, and how she was instantly healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has saved you; go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>He was still speaking when someone came from the synagogue-ruler, saying to him, Your daughter is dead, do not trouble the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard, He answered Him, saying, Do not fear, only believe and she shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And coming into the house, He allowed no one to go in, except Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the girl.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they ridiculed, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>And He put them all out. And He took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit came again, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that [food] be given her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished. But He charged them to tell no one the thing that happened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And He said to them, Take nothing for [your] journey, neither staffs, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor each to have two tunics.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things happening by Him. And he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from [the] dead;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But knowing [this], the crowds followed Him. And He received them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and He healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>But the day began to wear away, and coming up the Twelve said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the villages and farms all around, and lodge, and get food. For we are here in a deserted place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But He said to them, You give them [something] to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And He took the five loaves and the two fish. And looking up to Heaven, He blessed them and broke, and He gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And He strictly charged them and commanded to tell no one this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And He said to all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever will save his life shall lose it, but whoever will lose his life for My sake, he shall save it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, hear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and told no one in those days anything which they had seen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air [have] nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay [His] head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.21'>and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. But even the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>And it happened that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich one also died and was buried.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>But Abraham said, Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted and you are tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>And besides all this, there is a great chasm fixed between you and us; so that they desiring to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they pass over to us from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>And he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.28'>for I have five brothers, so that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.29'>Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.30'>And he said, No, father Abraham, but if one should go to them from [the] dead, they would repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.31'>And he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even though one rose from [the] dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>And He also spoke a parable to them to [teach] it is always right to pray, and not to faint,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying, A certain judge was in a certain city, not fearing God, nor respecting man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And a widow was in that city. And she came to Him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed within himself in this way: God, I thank You that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax-collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice [on] the Sabbath, I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And standing afar off, the tax-collector would not even lift up [his] eyes to Heaven, but struck on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him. And He said to him, Zaccheus! Hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Therefore there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died without children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her [as] a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And answering, Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but they who shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Nor can they die [any] more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses pointed out at the Bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>For He is not God of [the] dead, but of the living. For all live to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And answering, certain of the scribes said, Teacher, you have spoken well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And after that they did not dare ask Him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And He said to them, How do they say that Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Even David himself says in [the] Book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And as all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at the feasts;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led Him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country. And they laid the cross on him, that he might carry [it] after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of people were following Him, and of women who also were bewailing and lamenting Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But turning to them, Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which did not suckle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>And they shall begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! And to the hills, Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two others, two criminals, were led with Him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on [the] right, and one on [the] left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do. And parting His clothing, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood watching. And also the rulers with them, scoffing, saying, He saved others, let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him, and offering Him sour wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If You are the king of the Jews, save Yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are Christ, save Yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, since [you] are in the same condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly so, for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this Man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until [the] ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And when He had said this, He breathed out the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And when the centurion saw what had been done, he glorified God, saying, Truly this Man was righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, beholding the things happening, struck their breasts and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all those known to Him stood at a distance; and [the] women, those accompanying Him from Galilee, [were] seeing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, a man named Joseph, a councillor, a good man and a just one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>this one was not assenting to their counsel and deed. [He was] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews; and he also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This [man] went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down and wrapped it in linen. And he laid it in a tomb that had been cut in the stone, in which no man had before been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And also women [were] following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned and [they] prepared spices and ointment. And they rested [on] the sabbath day according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And [on] the first of the sabbaths, while still very early, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And going in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And as they were much perplexed about it, it happened that, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed [their] faces down to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of man must be delivered into [the] hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered His words</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returned from the tomb and told all these things to the Eleven and to the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them like foolishness, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>And Peter arose and ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linens lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, it being [about] sixty stadia from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked to each other of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And while they talked and reasoned, it happened that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were held [so that] they could not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And He said to them, What words [are] these that you have with one another [as] you walk, and are so sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said to Him, [Are] you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have occurred there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to [the] judgment of death, and have crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we had trusted that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yes, and also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they did not find His body, [they] came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of those with us went to the tomb and found [it] even as the women had said. But they did not see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And He said to them, O fools and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets spoke!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near the village where they were going. And He appeared to be going further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it happened [as] He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed [it], and breaking it, He gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way and while He opened the Scriptures to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found assembled the Eleven and those with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>And they said, the Lord has indeed risen, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And in the way they related the things happening, and how He had been known by them in breaking of the loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spoke this, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and filled with fear, for they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold My hands and My feet, that I am He! Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see Me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when He had spoken this, He showed them [His] hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they still did not believe for joy, and wondered, He said to them, Have you any food here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they handed to Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And He took [it] and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And He said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and [in] the Psalms about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And He said to them, So it is written, and so it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from [the] dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and remission of sins should be proclaimed in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I send the promise of My father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And He led them out as far as Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried up into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
