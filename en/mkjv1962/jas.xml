      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a servant of God and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion, greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brothers, count [it] all joy when you fall into different kinds of temptations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>knowing that the trying of your faith works patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>But let patience have its perfect work, so that you may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, [who] gives to all liberally and with no reproach, and it shall be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For he who doubts is like a wave of [the] sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For do not let that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>[he is] a double-minded man, not dependable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>But let [the] humble brother rejoice in his exaltation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and the rich one [rejoice] in his humiliation, because he shall pass away as the flower of the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rose with the hot wind and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the beauty of its appearance perished; so also the rich one will fade away in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed [is] the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no one being tempted say, I am tempted from God. For God is not tempted by evils, and He tempts no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But each one is tempted by his lusts, being drawn away and seduced [by them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then when lust has conceived, [it] brings forth sin. And sin, when it is fully formed, brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not err, my beloved brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of [His own] will He brought us forth with [the] Word of truth, for us to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>For the wrath of man does not work out [the] righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore putting aside all filthiness and overflowing of evil, receive in meekness the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But become doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if anyone is a hearer of [the] Word and not a doer, he is like a man studying his natural face in a mirror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>For he studied himself and went his way, and immediately [he] forgot what he was like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], he is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of [the] work. This one shall be blessed in his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If anyone thinks to be religious among you, [yet] does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this one's religion [is] vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure religion and undefiled before God and [the] Father [is] this, to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brothers, do not have the faith of our Lord Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respecter of faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if there comes a gold-fingered man in fancy clothing into your assembly, and if there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and if you have respect to him who has the fancy clothing and say to him, You sit here in a good place, and say to the poor, You stand there, or sit here under my footstool;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Did you not make a difference among yourselves and became judges [with] evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you dishonored the poor one. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do they not blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. But if you do not commit adultery, yet if you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak and do as those who shall be judged by [the] law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For he who has shown no mercy shall have judgment without mercy, and mercy exults over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>My brothers, what profit [is it] if a man says he has faith and does not have works? Can faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and if one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, but you do not give them those things which are needful to the body, what good [is it] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Even so, if it does not have works, faith is dead, being by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith from my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You believe that there is one God, you do well; even the demons believe and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Do you see how faith worked with his works, and from the works faith was made complete?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see then how a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she had received the messengers and had [sent] them out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>My brothers, do not be many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For [in] many [things] we all offend. If anyone does not offend in word, the same [is] a full-grown man, able also to bridle the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, so that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Behold also the ships being so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small rudder, where the impulse of him steering desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold how little a fire kindles how large a forest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity. So the tongue is set among our members, spotting all the body and inflaming the course of nature, and being inflamed by hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every kind of animals, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of sea-animals, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But no one can tame the tongue, [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>By this we bless God, even [the] Father. And by this we curse men, who have come into being according to the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does a fountain send forth at the same hole the sweet and the bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries; or a vine, figs? So no fountain [can] yield both salt water and fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who [is] wise and knowing among you? Let him show his works by [his] good conduct with meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This is not the wisdom coming down from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where envying and strife [are], there [is] confusion and every foul deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom that is from above is first truly pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And [the] fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>From where do wars and fightings among you [come]? [Is it] not from this, from your lusts which war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You desire, and do not have. You murder, and are jealous, and cannot obtain. You fight and war, yet you have not because you ask not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend [it] upon your lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity [with] God? Therefore whoever desires to be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us yearns to envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says, God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Therefore submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, sinners; and purify your hearts, double-minded ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted, and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and [your] joy to heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Be humbled before the Lord, and He will lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against [his] brother, and who judges his brother, speaks against the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you who judges another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now, those saying, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and spend a year there, and we will trade and will make a profit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>who do not know of the morrow. For what [is] your life? For it is a vapor, which appears for a little time, and then disappears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead of you saying, If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Therefore to him who knows to do good, and does not do [it], to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now, rich ones, weep and howl for your hardships coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver have corroded, and their poison will be a witness against you, and will eat your flesh as fire. You heaped treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold, the hire of the laborers reaping your fields cry out, being kept back by you. And the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of [the] Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have lived luxuriously on the earth, and lived wantonly. You have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned [and] murdered the just; he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it, until he receives [the] early and the latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You also be patient, establish your hearts, for the coming of your Lord draws near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Do not grudge against one another, brothers, lest you be condemned. Behold, [the] Judge stands before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>My brothers, take the prophets who have spoken in the name of [the] Lord, [for] an example of suffering ill, and of patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we count blessed those who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is full of pity and of tender mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But before all things, my brothers, do not swear; neither by the heaven nor by the earth, nor any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and [your] no, no, lest you fall into condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing psalms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And the prayer of faith will cure the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess faults to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. [The] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous one avails much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of like passion as we are. And he prayed earnestly [that it] might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for the time of three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to sprout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brothers, if anyone among you err from the truth, and if anyone turns him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>know that he who turns back the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</verse>
