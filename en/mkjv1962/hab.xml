      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O LORD, until when shall I cry and You will not hear? I cry out to You [of] violence, and You do not save!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why do You show me evil, and You look on toil? For destruction and violence [are] before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law has become helpless, and justice does not always go forth. For the wicked entraps the righteous; therefore justice goes forth, being perverted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Look among the nations, and behold and wonder marvelously; for [I] will work a work in your days [which] you will not believe, not even if it is declared to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, the bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess homes not their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>He [is] terrible and fearful; his judgment and his majesty comes forth from Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>His horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. And their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from afar. They shall fly like the eagle hurrying to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>All of him shall come for violence; the gathering of their faces [is] forward; and they gather captives like the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the rulers [shall] be a scorn to them. They shall laugh at every stronghold, for he shall heap up dust and capture it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then he sweeps on [like] a wind, and he transgresses and is guilty, [crediting] his power to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>[Are] You not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, You have ordained them for judgment; and, my Rock, You have established them for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>[You are] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look upon vexation. Why do You look upon those who deal deceitfully? Will you be silent when the wicked swallows [one] more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>For You make man like the fish of the sea, like creeping things with no ruler over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>He takes up all of them with the hook; he drags him with his net and gathers him with his seine; therefore he rejoices and exults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>So he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his seine; because by them his portion [is] fat and his food rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall he then empty his net, and shall he not spare to continually slay nations?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand on my watch and set myself on the tower, and will watch to see what He will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And the LORD answered me and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain on the tablets, that he who reads it may run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision [is] still for an appointed time, but it [speaks] to the end, and it does not lie. Though it lingers, wait for it; because it will surely come. It will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, the soul of him is lifted up, [and] is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>And also wine indeed betrays a proud man, and [he is] not content. He widens his soul like Sheol, and he [is] like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all nations to himself, and heaps to himself all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all these lift up a parable against him, and a mocking riddle to him, and say, Woe to him who increases [what is] not his! Until when, then, shall he load the pledges on himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall not those who strike you rise up suddenly, and [those] who shake you awake, and you become a prize to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because you have stripped many nations, all the rest of the people shall strip you; because of men's blood, and the violence of the land, of the city, and of all who dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Woe [to] him who robs evil booty for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>You have planned shame to your house, to make an end of many people, and are sinning [in] your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Woe [to] him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Behold, [is it] not for the LORD of hosts that the people labor only for fire; yea, the nations weary themselves only for vanity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe [to] him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring out your wineskin, and also making [him] drunk, that you may look on their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>You are filled with shame instead of glory; drink also, and [be] seen as one uncircumcised! The cup of the LORD's right hand shall turn on you, and disgrace [shall be] your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the ruin of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of man, and the violence of the land, the city, and all those dwelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What does an image profit, for its maker has carved it; a molten image, and a teacher of lies? For does the maker trust in his work on it, to make dumb idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe [to] him who says to the wood. Awake! To a dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] overlaid [with] gold and silver, and no breath is in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But the LORD [is] in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet concerning erring ones:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O LORD, I have heard Your report; I am afraid. O LORD, give new life [to] Your work in the midst of years; in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And [His] brightness is as the light; rays from His hand [are] His, and there [was] a hiding of His strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>A plague went before Him, and lightning went forth at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations, and the everlasting mountains were shattered; the eternal hills bowed down. His ways [are] everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>I saw the tents of Cushan under calamity; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Did the LORD burn against rivers? Or [was] Your anger against the rivers? Or Your wrath against the sea? [For] You ride on horses, Your chariots of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>You make Your bow naked, [according to] the oaths of the rods of [Your] word. Selah. You have cut through the earth [with] rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>They saw You; mountains trembled. The storm of water passed over; the deep uttered its voice [and] lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>The sun [and] moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they go, and at the shining of Your gleaming spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>You march into the land in fury; You thresh nations in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for salvation with Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked, to bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>You pierced the head of his warriors with his shafts; they storm out to scatter me; their rejoicing [is] to devour the meek in a secret place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>You trod in the sea with] Your horses, the foaming of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>I heard and my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself that I might rest in the day of trouble; to come up against the people; he cuts him off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the labor of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food. The flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd [is] in the stalls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>Jehovah the Lord [is] my strength, and He will make my feet like hinds' [feet], and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</verse>
