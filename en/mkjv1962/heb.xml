      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who at many times and in many ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last days spoken to us by His] Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the shining splendor of [His] glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, through Himself cleansing of our sins, [He] sat down on [the] right of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>being made so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did He say at any time, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You? And again, I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when He brings in the First-born into the world, He says, And let all [the] angels of God worship Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels He says, Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But to the Son [He says], Your throne, O God, [is] forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of Your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, You, Lord, have laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but You will remain. And [they] shall all become old as a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a covering You shall fold them up, and [they] shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels, did He say at any time, Sit on My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and if every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape [if] we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by those who heard [Him] ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God [also] bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different kinds of miracles and gifts [of the] Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For He has not put in subjection to the angels the world to come, of which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one testified in a certain place, saying, What is man, that You are mindful of him; or the son of man, that You visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You have made him a little lower than [the] angels. You crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to Him, He did not leave anything not subjected to Him. But now we do not see all things having been subjected to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who [was] made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He by [the] grace of God should taste death for every [son].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became Him, for whom [are] all things and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons into glory, to perfect the Captain of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both He who sanctifies and they who are sanctified [are] all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I will put My trust in Him. And again, Behold Me and the children whom God has given Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since then the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise partook of the same; that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death (that is, the Devil),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For truly He did not take [the nature of] angels, but He took hold of [the] seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like [His] brothers, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of [His] people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that He Himself has suffered, having been tempted, He is able to rescue those who are being tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, called [to be] partakers of the heavenly [calling], consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also [was faithful] in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For He was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who has built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses truly [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken afterward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>But Christ [was faithful] as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you will hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>when your fathers tempted Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was grieved with that generation and said, They always err in [their] heart, and they have not known My ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from [the] living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through [the] deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to [the] end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said, Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some, when they had heard, did provoke; however, not all who came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>But with whom was He grieved forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did He swear [that they should] not enter into His rest, but to those who did not believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore, a promise being left to enter into His rest, let us fear lest any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For also we have had the gospel preached, as well as them. But the word [preached] did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed do enter into the rest, as He said, I have sworn in My wrath that they should not enter into My rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For He spoke in a certain place of the seventh [day] in this way: And God rested the seventh day from all His works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And in this place again, They shall not enter into My rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since then it remains that some must enter into it, and since they to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>He again marks out a certain day, saying in David, Today, (after so long a time). Even as it is said, Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>So then there remains a rest to the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God [did] from His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Therefore let us labor to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God [is] living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to [the] dividing apart of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things [are] naked and opened to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Since then we have a great High Priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a high priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted just as [we are, yet] without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in the things [pertaining] to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those who are out of the way. For he himself also is compassed with weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And because of this he should, as for the people, so also for himself, offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron [was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to be made a high priest, but He who said to Him, You are My Son, today I have begotten You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As He says also in another [place], You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>[For Jesus], in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cryings and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though being a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And being perfected, He became [the] Author of eternal salvation to all those who obey Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>of whom we [have] much to say, and hard to be explained since you are dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For indeed because of the time, you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again what [are] the first principles of the oracles of God. And you have become [in] need of milk, and not of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone partaking of milk [is] unskillful [in the] word of righteousness, for he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, [even] those who because of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, having left the discourse of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to full growth, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of [the] baptisms, of doctrine, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted [the] good Word of God and [the] powers of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and who have fallen away; it is impossible, I say, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify the Son of God afresh to themselves and put [Him] to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>(For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth plants fit for those by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But [that which] bears thorns and briers [is] rejected and [is] a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation, though we speak in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire that each one of you show the same eagerness to the full assurance of hope to [the] end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you be not slothful, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, [He] swore by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, Surely in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men truly swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In this way desiring to declare more fully to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, God interposed by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>so that by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible [for] God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before [us] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where the Forerunner has entered for us, even] Jesus, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To him Abraham also gave a tenth of all. [He was] first by interpretation king of righteousness, and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, [he] remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this man [was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And truly they [who are] of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priest, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, from their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here men who die receive tithes; but there he [receives them], of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And if I may say so, Levi, also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Therefore if perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made in the law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is still far more evident, since there arises another priest after the likeness of Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For He testifies, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For truly there] is a putting away of the commandment which went before, because of the weakness and unprofitableness of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did], by which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as [He was] not made priest] without an oath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>(for those priests were made without an oath, but this one was made with an oath by Him who said to Him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You [are] a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue because of death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost those who come unto God by Him, [since He] ever lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not need, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice daily, first for his own [sins] and then for the people's sins. For He did this once for all, when He offered up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the Law appoints men high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the swearing of an oath, after the Law, [has consecrated] the Son forever, having been perfected.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now the sum of the things which we have spoken [is this]: We have such a High Priest, who has sat down on [the] right of the throne of the Majesty in Heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Therefore [it is] necessary that this One have something to offer also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if indeed He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For, He says See [that] you make all things according to the pattern shown to you in the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which was built upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first [covenant] had been without fault, [then] no place would have been sought for the] second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault with them, He said to them, Behold, days are coming, says [the] Lord, and I will make an end on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah; a new covenant shall be,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their mind and write them in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not each man teach his neighbor, and each man his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know Me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that He says, A new [covenant], He has made the first one old. Now that which decays and becomes old [is] ready to vanish away.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Then truly the first [tabernacle] had also ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which [was] both the lampstand, and the table, and the setting out of the loaves, which is called Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second veil [was] a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all around with gold, in which [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And over it were the cherubs of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat (about which we cannot now speak piece by piece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things were ordained in this way, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But once [in] the year into the second the high priest [goes] alone, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit signifying [by] this [that] the way into the Holiest of all was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>For it [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him who did the service perfect as regards the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>[which stood] only in meats and drinks, and different kinds of washings and fleshly ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But when Christ had become a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by [His] own blood [He] entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ (who through [the] eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God) purge your conscience from dead works to serve [the] living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first covenant, those who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a covenant [is], the death of him covenanting must be offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a covenant [is] affirmed over [those] dead, since it never has force when The one covenanting is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>From which we see that neither was the first [covenant] dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For [when] Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, [he] took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore [it was] necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified [with] these, but the heavenly things themselves were purified] with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ has not entered into the [Holy of] Holies made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, even as the high priest enters into the [Holy of] Holies every year with the blood of others</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>(for then He must have suffered often since [the] foundation of the world), but now once in the end of the world He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so Christ was once offered to bear [the] sins of many. And to those who look for Him He shall appear the second [time] without sin to salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the Law which has a shadow of good things to come, not the very image of the things, [appearing] year by year with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually, they are never able to perfect those drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshipers, when they had been once for all purged, would have had no more conscience of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore when He comes into the world, He says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You have prepared a body for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin You have had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, Lo, I come ( in the] volume of the Book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Above, when He said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin You did not desire, neither did You have pleasure in them (which are offered according to the Law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then He said, Lo, I come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first so that He may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By this will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And indeed every priest stands daily ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down [on the] right of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from then on expecting until His enemies are made His footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>The Holy Spirit also is a witness to us; for after He had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>also [He adds, their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the [Holy of] Holies by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, His flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and [our] bodies having been washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering (for He is faithful who promised),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>and let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is], but exhorting [one another], and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful looking for judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>He who despised Moses' law died without mercy on [the word of] two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy of punishment, the [one] who has trampled the Son of God, and who has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know Him who has said, Vengeance [belongs] to Me, I will repay, says [the] Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But call to memory the former days, in which (after you were illuminated) you endured a great fight of afflictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>indeed being exposed both by reproaches and afflictions, and while you became companions of those who lived so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you both sympathized with my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in Heaven a better and an enduring substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great [recompense of] reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of patience, so that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little while, and He who shall come will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>Now, the Just shall live by faith. But if he draws back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of those] withdrawing to destruction, but of those who believe to [the] preserving of [the] soul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is [the] substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that] the ages were] framed by a word of God, so that the things being seen not to have come into being out of the things that appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness [that he] was righteous, God testifying of his gifts. And by it he, being dead, yet speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated [so as] not to see death, and he was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith [it is] impossible to please [Him], for he who comes to God must believe that He is and [that] He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having been warned by God of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark to [the] saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness [which is] according to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out into a place which he was afterward going to receive for an inheritance. And [he] went out, not knowing where he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs of the same promise with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged Him who had promised [to be] faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Because of this came into being [from] one, and that of one] having died, even as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died by way of faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off. And they were persuaded of [them] and embraced [them] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For they who say such things declare plainly that they seek a fatherland.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'>Do not be carried about with different and strange doctrines, for [it is] good for the heart to be established with grace, not with foods, in which those who have walked [in them] were not helped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.10'>We have an altar of which they have no right to eat, those who serve the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'>For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the [Holy of] Holies by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.12'>Therefore Jesus also, so that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'>Therefore let us go forth to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'>For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>By Him, then, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, [the] fruit of [our] lips, confessing His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Yield to those leading you, and be submissive, for they watch for your souls, [as those who must] give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that [is] unprofitable for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.18'>Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.19'>But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, so that I may be more quickly restored to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.20'>Now may the God of peace (who brought again our Lord Jesus from [the] dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through [the] blood of the everlasting covenant)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.21'>make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that [which] is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.22'>And I beseech you, brothers, allow the word of exhortation. For I have written a letter to you in few words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.23'>Know that [our] brother Timothy has been set at liberty, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.24'>Greet all those leading you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.25'>Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</verse>
