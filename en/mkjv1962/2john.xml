        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the sake of the truth dwelling in us, and [which] shall be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace will be with you, mercy [and] peace from God [the] Father and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly that I found your children walking in truth, as we have received command from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from [the] beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in [the] flesh. This is the deceiver and the anti-christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, so that we may not lose those things which we worked out, but that we may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Everyone transgressing and not abiding in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into [your] house, nor speak a greeting to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he who speaks a greeting to him is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I do not want [to say] with paper and ink. But I trust to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
