      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was made strong in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him and made him very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>And Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place at Gibeon. For there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>And he put the bronze altar which Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the congregation of the LORD sought to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which [was] at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God, You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me to reign in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O LORD God, Your promise to David my father has been fulfilled. For You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can judge this Your great people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, nor honor, nor the life of your enemies, nor yet have asked for long life but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge My people, over whom I have made you king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge [is] granted to you. And I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before you, nor shall any after you have the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>And Solomon came [from] the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem like stones, and he made cedar trees as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and Kue. The king's merchants received [them] from Kue at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>And they carried up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so they brought out [horses] for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>And Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand as cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent to Hiram the king of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, [so deal with me.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I am building a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate [it] to Him, and to burn before Him sweet incense, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I am building [is] great. For our God is great above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build Him a house, since the heavens and heaven of the heavens cannot contain Him? Who [am] I then, that I should build Him a house, except only to burn sacrifice before Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>And now send me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and one who is skillful to engrave with the skillful men who [are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>And send me cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon. For I know that your servants are skillful to cut timber in Lebanon. And, behold, my servants [shall be] with your servants</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>in order to prepare plenty of timber for me. For the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And behold, I will give to the hewers, those who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>And Hiram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved His people, He has made you king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>And Hiram said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son blessed with judgment and understanding, who might build a house for the LORD and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I have sent a skillful man blessed with understanding, of Hiram my father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson. He also can engrave any kind of engraving, and can invent every device which shall be put to him, with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>And now the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need. And we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa. And you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Solomon numbered all the aliens in the land of Israel, according to the numbering with which David his father had numbered them. And they [were] found to be a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set seventy thousand of them [to be] bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>And Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in Mount Moriah, where He appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these [are] the foundations Solomon [laid], to build the house of God. The length [by] cubits according to the first measure, sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch on the front, the length according to the breadth of the house, [was] twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty. And he overlaid it inside with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And he made the ceiling of the greater house with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold. And he set palm trees and chains on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he covered the house with precious stones for beauty. And the gold [was] gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He also overlaid the house, the beams, the posts, and its walls, and its doors, with gold. And he engraved cherubs on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the Most Holy Place. Its length [was] by the front, of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with fine gold, to six hundred talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper rooms with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And in the most holy house he made two cherubs of carved work, and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the wings of the cherubs [were] twenty cubits long. One wing [was] five cubits, touching to the wall of the house; and the other wing five cubits, touching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And [one] wing of the other cherub [was] five cubits, touching to the wall of the house; and the other wing five cubits, touching to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits. And they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and worked cherubs on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>He also made two pillars of thirty-five cubits high in front of the house, and the capital on the tops of each of them [was] five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains, [as] in the holy place, and put them on the tops of the pillars. And he made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left. And he called the name of the one on the right Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>And he made an altar of bronze. Twenty cubits [was] the length of it, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>And He cast a sea of melted bronze, ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, and five cubits [was] its height. And a line of thirty cubits went around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And under it was the shape of oxen, under it and all around it for ten cubits, going all around the sea. Two rows of oxen [were] cast when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east. And the sea [was] set above on them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And its thickness [was] a handbreadth, and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies. It received [and] held three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He also made ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. They washed in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering. But the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>And He made ten tables, and placed [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Hiram finished the work that he was to make for King Solomon for the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>the two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals on the tops of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of the capitals which [were] on the top of the pillars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths, two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two bowls of the capitals on the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He also made bases, and he made lavers on the bases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>and one sea, and twelve oxen under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all their vessels of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>And Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance. For the weight of the bronze could not be found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And Solomon made all the vessels [for] the house of God, and the golden altar, and the tables on which the showbread [was set] ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>and the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, so that they should burn according to the law before the holy place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs [of] gold, perfect gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, [of] pure gold; and the entrance of the house, the inner doors of it for the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, [of] gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>And all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated. And he put the silver and the gold, and all the vessels among the treasures of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>And Solomon gathered the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which [is] Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel gathered themselves to the king in the feast in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came. And the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that [were] in the tabernacle. The priests [and] the Levites brought these up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were gathered to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the Holy of Holies in the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubs spread out [their] wings over the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its staves above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And they drew out the staves so that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle. But they were not seen outside. And there it is until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>Nothing [was] in the ark except the two tables which Moses put [in it] at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the sons of Israel when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it happened as the priests came out of the holy [place], for all the priests present were sanctified, and did not wait by division.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>And the Levitical singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, [being] clothed in white linen, having cymbals and with harps and lyres, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>and [they] were as one to the trumpeters and to the singers, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and as they lifted up [their] voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, [saying], For He is good, for His mercy [endures] forever, the house was filled with a cloud, the house of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>And Solomon said, The LORD has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>And I have built a house for You to live in, and a place for Your dwelling forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. And all the congregation of Israel stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, who has with His hands fulfilled that which He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>From the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt I have not chosen any city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, so that My name might be there. Nor have I chosen any man to be a ruler over My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>But now I have chosen Jerusalem, so that My name might be there, and now I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the LORD said to David my father, Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>But you shall not build the house; but your son, who shall come forth out of your loins, shall build the house for My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>And the LORD has lifted up His word that He has spoken. For I have risen up in place of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And I have put the ark in it, in which [is] the covenant of the LORD which He made with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>For Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high. And he had set it in the midst of the court. And he stood on it, and kneeled down on his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And he said, O LORD God of Israel, [there is] no God like You in Heaven or in earth. You keep Your covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>You have kept with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him. And You spoke with Your mouth, and have fulfilled [it] with Your hand, as [it is] this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>And now, O LORD God of Israel, keep with Your servant David my father that which You have promised him, saying, There shall not fail you a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way to walk in My law, as you have walked before Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>And now, O LORD God of Israel, let Your word be proven true, which You have spoken to Your servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But truly will God in deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, Heavens and heaven of the heavens cannot contain You! How much less this house which I have built?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>And You have turned toward the prayer of Your servant, and to his cry, O LORD my God, to listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant prays before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>I pray that Your eyes may be open on this house day and night, on the place of which You have said that You would put Your name there, to listen to the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And You will listen to the cries of Your servant, and of Your people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place, and You will hear from Your dwelling place, from Heaven, and shall hear and forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>If a man sins against his neighbor, and if an oath is laid on him to make him swear, and if the oath comes before Your altar in this house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>then hear from Heaven, and do, and judge Your servants by repaying the wicked, by bringing his way back on his own head, and by justifying [the] righteous, by giving to him according to his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>And if Your people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against You, and if they shall return and confess Your name, and shall pray and cry before You in this house,</verse>
