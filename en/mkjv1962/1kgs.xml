      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>And King David was old, going on in days. And they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>And his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and let her nurse him, and let her lie in your bosom, so that my lord the king may get heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>And they sought out a beautiful girl throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag, a Shunammite. And they brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the girl [was] very beautiful. And she nursed the king and served him. But the king did not know her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time, saying, Why have you done so? And he also [was] very good of form, and [his mother] bore him after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he talked with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And they helped Adonijah, following [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and David's mighty men, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the Stone of Serpents, which [is] by En-rogel, and called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But he did not call Nathan the prophet and Benaiah and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>And now come, please let me give you counsel, and save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go up and go in to King David, and say to him, My lord, O king, did you not swear to your handmaid, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while you are still talking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the room. And the king [was] very old, and Abishag the Shunammite served the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed and knelt before the king. And the king said, What [shall I do] for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God to your handmaid, [saying], Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigns. And now, my lord, you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army. But he has not called your servant Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel [are] upon you, that you should tell them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>And it will be, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, my son Solomon and I shall be offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And lo, she was still talking with the king, and Nathan the prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And he came in before the king, and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down this day, and has killed a great many of oxen and fat cattle and sheep, and has called all the king's sons and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, Let King Adonijah live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But he has not called me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and have you not shown your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>And David answered and said, Call Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, [As] the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>surely as I swore to you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place, even so I will do today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>And Bathsheba bowed [her] face [to] the earth, even kneeling to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And King David said, Call Zadok the priest to me, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel there. And blow with the ram's horn, and say, Let King Solomon live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>And you shall come up after him, and let him come and sit upon my throne. For he shall reign in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen. May the LORD God of my lord the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>And Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the Tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the ram's horn, and all the people said, Let King Solomon live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced [with] great joy, so that the earth was torn with their sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah heard, and all the invited guests with him. And they stopped eating. And Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn, and said, What is this noise roaring from the city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And he was still speaking, and behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said to him, Come in, for you [are] a mighty man and you bring good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord King David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is roaring. This [is] the noise that you heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And also the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also the king said, Blessed [is] the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne today, my eyes even seeing [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all those who were invited by Adonijah trembled and arose and left, each to his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon. For, lo, he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me today that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he becomes a son of virtue, not a hair of his head shall fall to the earth. But if wickedness shall be found in him, then he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>And King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And the days of David drew near [for him] to die. And he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth. And you be strong and show yourself a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>that the LORD may continue His word which He spoke concerning me, saying, If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul saying, there shall not be a man of yours cut off from the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>And also you know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, that he murdered them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle on his loins, and in his shoes on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>And you shall do according to your wisdom and shall not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table. For so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, with you [is] Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me [with] a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>And now, do not hold him guiltless. For you [are] a wise man, and you know what you ought to do to him. But bring his gray head down to the grave with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel [were] forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father. And his kingdom was firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come peacefully? And he said, Peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>And he said, [I have] a word [to say] to you. And she said, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me that I should reign. However, the kingdom is turned around, and has become my brother's. For it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one favor of you; do not turn away your face. And she said to him, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Please speak to Solomon the king, for he will not turn away your face, that he give me Abishag the Shunammite for my wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, [Very] well; I will speak for you to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>And Bathsheba came in to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother. And she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>And she said, I desire one small favor of you. Do not turn away my face. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not turn away your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask the kingdom also for him. For he [is] my older brother! Even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>And King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, May God do so to me, and more He shall do, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>And now, [as] the LORD lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as He spoke, Adonijah shall be put to death today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he fell on him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to your fields, for you [are] worthy of death. But I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all [that in which] my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, so that he might fulfil the word of the LORD which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the report came to Joab. For Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and, behold, [he is] by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go fall on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, So says the king, come forth! And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and so he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him, so that you may take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the LORD shall return his blood on his own head, who fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David not knowing [of it], Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Yea, He shall turn back their blood on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. But on David, and on his seed, and on his house, and on his throne, there shall be peace forever from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell on him and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build a house at Jerusalem and live there, and do not go forth from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For it shall be, on the day you go out and pass over the torrent Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die. Your blood shall be on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, Your saying [is] good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it happened at the end of three years, two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants [are] in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him, Did I not make you swear by the LORD, and warn you, saying, In the day you go out, and you have gone anywhere, you certainly shall know that you shall surely die? And you said to me, The word I have heard [is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD and the command that I have charged you with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>And the king said to Shimei, You know all the wickedness that your heart knows, what you did to David my father. And the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>And King Solomon [shall be] blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell on him so that he died. And the kingdom was made sure in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made an alliance by marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he finished building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall around Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built to the name of the LORD until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father. Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there. For that [was] the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night. And God said, Ask what I shall give you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, You have shown to Your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before You in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with You. And You have kept this great kindness for him, that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as [it is] today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your servant king instead of David my father. And I [am] a little child; I do not know to go out or come in!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the word was good in the eyes of the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, and have not asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to judge justly,</verse>
