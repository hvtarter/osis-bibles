      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa; the word which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall dry up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will also break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the dweller from the Valley of Aven, and from him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden. And the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because they deported [as] exiles to deliver up a complete [population] to Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>And I will cut off the people from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon, and I will turn My hand against Ekron. And the rest of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it. Because they delivered up [as] exiles a complete [population] to Edom, and did not remember the brotherly covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>But I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it. Because he pursued his brother with the sword, and cast off all pities, and his anger tore without end, and he kept his wrath forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it. Because they have ripped up the pregnant women of Gilead, to make their own border larger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its palaces with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth. And Moab shall die with great noise, with shouting, with the sound of a trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the judge from its midst, and will kill all its rulers with him, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because they have despised the laws of the LORD, and have not kept His commandments. And their lies after which their fathers walked led them astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>So says the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, yea for four, I will not turn away [from] it; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>panting after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turning aside the way of the meek. And a man and his father will go [in] to the same woman, to defile My holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they will stretch beside every altar on garments taken in pledge, and they drink the wine of the condemned [in] the house of their god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height [was] like the height of the cedars, and he [was] strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from below.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazarites from your young men. [Is it] not even so, O sons of Israel? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart full of sheaves [is] pressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>And refuge shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his power, nor shall the mighty deliver his life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>nor shall he who handles the bow stand. And the swift-footed shall not save; and the horse rider shall not save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>And the stout-hearted among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this Word that the LORD has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you [for] all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Can two walk together unless they are agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey for him? Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Will a bird fall into a trap [on] the ground, and there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and nothing at all be caught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>If a ram's horn is blown in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is a calamity in a city, has the LORD not also done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>For the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken; who will not prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Make [it] heard at the palaces of Ashdod, and the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great uproars in its midst, and the oppressed in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they do not know to do right, says the LORD, those who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>So the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy! And he [shall be] all around the land; and he shall bring you down from your strength, and your palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>So says the LORD: As the shepherd takes two legs out of the mouth of the lion, or a piece of an ear; so shall the sons of Israel be taken out, those who dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus [on] a couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>for in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel. And the horns of the altar shall be cut off and shall fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>And I will strike the winter house together with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish. And the great houses shall be swept away, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, cows of Bashan who [are] in the mountain of Samaria; who press down the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their masters, Bring in, that we may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by His holiness that the days shall come on you that He will lift you up with meat hooks, and your sons with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>And you shall go out at the breaches, each woman straight before her. And you shall cast down the high place, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Bethel and transgress; to Gilgal and multiply transgressing [at] Gilgal. And bring your sacrifices for the morning, your tithes for three years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving from that [which is] leavened, and cry out; call out the voluntary offerings! For so you love [to do], O sons of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places, and you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>And I have also withheld the rain from you, when [there were] yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city and caused it not to rain on another city; one piece was rained on, and the piece on which it did not rain dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two [or] three cities wandered to one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have stricken you with blasting and mildew. When your gardens and your vineyards, and your fig trees. and your olive trees increased, the creeping locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent the plague among you in the way of Egypt; I have slain your young men with the sword, and have taken away your horses. And I have made the stench of your camps to come up into your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown some among you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand plucked out of the burning; yet you have not returned to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>So I will do this to you, O Israel; because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For lo, He forms the mountains and creates the wind, and declares to man what his thought [is]. He who makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth; the LORD, the God of hosts, [is] His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear this word which I take up against you, a dirge, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel has fallen; she shall rise no more; she lies forsaken on her land. There is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The city that went out [by] a thousand shall leave a hundred, and that which went out [by] a hundred shall have ten left in the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For so says the LORD to the house of Israel: Seek Me, and you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>But do not seek Bethel nor enter into Gilgal, and do not pass to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest He break out like a fire [on] the house of Joseph and devour it, and there be none to put it out in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>You who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness [in] the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>seek Him who created the Pleiades and Orion, and who turned the deep darkness into the morning and He darkened the day [into] night. Seek Him who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth; the LORD  is] His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>who causes destruction to flash out against the strong, and destruction comes against the fortress</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they despise him who speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>So, because of your trampling on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him; you have built houses of carved stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know your many transgressions and your many sins. They afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>So the understanding ones shall keep silent in that time; for it [is] an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate. It may be that the Lord Jehovah of hosts will be gracious [to] the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>So the LORD, the God of hosts, the Master, says this: Wailing [shall be] in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the tiller to mourning, and those who are skillful in mourning to wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>And there [shall be] wailing in all vineyards; for I will pass through you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to those desiring the day of the LORD! What [is] this for you? The day of the LORD [is] darkness and not light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>as [if] a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>[Shall] not the day of the LORD [be] darkness and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not delight in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your food offerings, I will not be pleased. Nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take the noise of your songs away from Me; for I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let judgment roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Have you offered sacrifices and offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>But you have carried the booth of your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>So I will cause you to go into exile beyond Damascus, says the LORD, the God of hosts [is] His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, who are noted [as] leader of the nations. And the house of Israel came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass to Calneh, and see; and from there go to Hamath the great. Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. [Are they] better than these kingdoms, or their border greater than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>who lie on beds of ivory, and those sprawling on their couches, and eat lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>who chant with the mouth of the harp; they invent instruments of music for themselves, like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best of oils; nor do they grieve for the breaking of Joseph!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>So now they shall go into exile with the first of the exiles. And the feast of those who stretch themselves shall cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, says the LORD, the God of hosts: I despise the glory of Jacob, and hate his palaces; and I will shut up the city and all its fullness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>And it shall be if ten men remain in one house, then they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to [him] left in the recesses of the house, Are any still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Hush! For not one shall mention the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, the LORD commands, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house [into] cracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run on the rock? Will one plow [there] with oxen? For you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>you who rejoice in nothing, who say, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>But behold, I will raise a nation up against you, O house of Israel, says the Lord, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance to Hamath to the torrent of the Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And behold, He is forming locusts at the beginning of the coming up of the late grass; even behold, the late grass after the king's mowings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>And it happened when it had made an end of eating the tender plant of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I pray You. How can Jacob stand? For he [is] small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>The LORD repented for this; it shall not be, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And behold, the Lord Jehovah was calling to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and [it was] devouring part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then I said, O Lord Jehovah, I pray You, cease. How can Jacob stand? For he [is] small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>The LORD repented for this; this also shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>He made me see this: And behold, the Lord was standing by the plumbline-wall, and a plumbline in His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>And the LORD said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumbline. Then the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>And the high places of Isaac shall be wasted, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has plotted against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For so Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely go into exile out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>And Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go, flee for yourself into the land of Judah; and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But do not prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king's temple, and it [is] the king's royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah: I [was] no prophet, nor [was] I a prophet's son. But I [was] a herdsman and a gatherer [from] sycamore trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>And the LORD took me from behind the flock, and the LORD said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now then hear the Word of the LORD. You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop [words] against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>So the LORD says this: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line. And you shall die in a defiled land; and Israel shall surely go into exile out of his land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And behold, a basket of summer fruit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the LORD said to me, The end has come to My people Israel: I will never pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, says the Lord Jehovah. The dead bodies [shall be] many. In every place one shall throw [them] out, saying, Hush!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, you who trample the poor, even to make the humble of the land to fail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'>saying, When will the new moon be gone so that we may sell grain? And the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small and the shekel great, and perverting the balances by deceit;</verse>
