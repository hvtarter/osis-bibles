        <verse osisID='Num.11.1'>And the people [were] evil, as those complaining in the ears of the LORD. And the LORD heard, and His anger was kindled. And the fire of the LORD burned among them and devoured in the outermost parts of the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.2'>And the people cried to Moses. And when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.3'>And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the LORD burned among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.4'>And the mixed multitude in their midst lusted with [great] lust. And the sons of Israel also turned and wept, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.5'>We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.6'>But now our soul [is] dried away; there is nothing at all besides this manna [before our] eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.7'>And the manna [was] like coriander seed, and the color of it was like the color of bdellium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.8'>The people went around and gathered, and ground it in mills, or beat [it] in a mortar, and baked in pans, and made cakes of it. And the taste of it was like the taste of fresh oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.9'>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.10'>Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent. And the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.11'>And Moses said to the LORD, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, so that You lay the burden of all this people upon me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.12'>Have I conceived all this people? Did I bring them forth, that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom like a nursing father carries the sucking child, to the land which You swore to their fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.13'>From where should I get flesh to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.14'>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because [it is] too heavy for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.15'>And if You are going to part this way with me, I beg You to kill me at once, if I have found favor in Your sight, and let me not see my misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.16'>And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and the officers over them. And bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation so that they may stand there with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.17'>And I will come down and talk with you there. And I will take of the spirit on you, and will put [it] on them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with you so that you do not bear [it] yourself alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.18'>And say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh. For you have wept in the ears of the Lord, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat, for [it was] well with us in Egypt? Therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and you shall eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.19'>You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.20'>Even a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is hateful to you, because you have despised the LORD among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we come out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.21'>And Moses said, The people among whom I [am] [are] six hundred thousand footmen. And You have said, I will give them flesh so that they may eat a whole month!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.22'>Shall the flocks and the herds be killed for them, to be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.23'>And the LORD said to Moses, Has the LORD's hand become short? You shall see now whether or not My word shall come to pass to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.24'>And Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them all around the tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.25'>And the LORD came down in a cloud and spoke to him, and took of the spirit on him and gave [it] to the seventy elders. And it happened when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they never did so again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.26'>But two of the men stayed in the camp; the name of the one [was] Eldad, and the name of the other was Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. And they [were] of those who were written, but did not go out to the tabernacle. And they prophesied in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.27'>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.28'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, [one] of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, make them cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.29'>And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.30'>And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.31'>And a wind went forth from the LORD. And it cut off quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits [high upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.32'>And the people stood up all that day and all night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. And he that gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread [them] out for themselves all around the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.33'>And while the flesh [was] yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck the people with a very great plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.34'>And he called the name of that place Graves of Lust, because there they buried the people that lusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.11.35'>[And] the people pulled up from the Graves of Lust to Hazeroth, and stayed at Hazeroth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.12'>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.1'>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had taken. For he had taken a Cushite woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.2'>And they said, Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Has He not also spoken by us? And the LORD heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.3'>(Now the man Moses [was] very meek, more than all the men on the face of the earth.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.4'>And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the tabernacle of the congregation. And the three came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.5'>And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood [in] the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam. And they both came forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.6'>And He said, Hear now My words. If there is a prophet among you, [I] the LORD will make Myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.7'>Not so, My servant Moses. He [is] faithful in all My house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.8'>I will speak with him mouth to mouth, even clearly, and not in dark speeches. And he shall behold the likeness of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.9'>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them, and He moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.10'>And the cloud moved from the tabernacle. And behold! Miriam [became] leprous, as snow. And Aaron looked on Miriam, and behold, [she was] leprous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.11'>And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not lay upon us the sin in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.12'>Let her not be like one dead, of whom the flesh is half gone when he comes out of his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.13'>And Moses cried to the LORD saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.14'>And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.15'>And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. And the people did not pull up until Miriam was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.12.16'>And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Num.13'>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.1'>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.2'>Send men so that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel. You shall send a man from every tribe of their fathers, everyone a ruler among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.3'>And Moses by the command of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran. All those men [were] heads of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.4'>And these [were] their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.5'>Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.6'>Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.7'>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.8'>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.9'>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.10'>Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.11'>Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.12'>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.13'>Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.14'>Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.15'>Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.16'>These [were] the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.17'>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this [way], southward, and go up [into] the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.18'>And see the land, what it [is], and the people that live in it, whether it is strong or weak, few or many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.19'>And see what the land [is] that they live in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.20'>and what the land [is], whether fat or lean, whether there is wood in it or not. And be of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of first ripe grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.21'>So they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.22'>And they went up by the south and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.23'>And they came to the valley of Eshcol and cut from there a branch with one cluster of grapes. And they carried it between two men upon a staff, and some of the pomegranates and of the figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.24'>The place was called the valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.25'>And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.26'>And they left and came to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh. And they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.27'>And they told him and said, We came to the land where you sent us, and surely it flows with milk and honey. And this [is] the fruit of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.28'>However, the people that dwell in the land [are] strong, and the cities [are] walled, very great. And also we saw the children of Anak there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.29'>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains. And the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.30'>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and possess it. For we are well able to overcome it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.31'>But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they [are] stronger than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.32'>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched to the sons of Israel, saying, The land through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eats up those who live in it. And all the people whom we saw in it were men of stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.13.33'>And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, of the giants. And we were in our own sight like grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Num.14'>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.1'>And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried. And the people wept that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.2'>And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And the whole congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or, Oh that we had died in the wilderness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.3'>And why has the LORD brought us into this land to fall by the sword, so that our wives and our sons should be a prey? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.4'>And they said to one another, Let us make a leader, and let us return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.5'>And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those that searched the land, tore their clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.7'>And they spoke to all the company of the [sons] of Israel saying, The land which we passed through to search is an exceedingly good land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.8'>If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.9'>Only do not rebel against the LORD, neither fear the people of the land. For they [are] bread for us. Their protection has moved from them, and the LORD [is] with us. Do not fear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.10'>But all the congregation said to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.11'>And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people provoke Me? And how long will it be before they believe Me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.12'>I will strike them with the pestilence and will disinherit them, and will make of you a greater nation and mightier than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.13'>And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear, for You have brought up this people in Your might from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.14'>And they will say to the inhabitant of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, [are] among this people, who is seen eye to eye. You [are] Jehovah, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.15'>And will you kill this people as one man? Then the nations who have heard Your fame will speak, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.16'>Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to them, therefore He has slain them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.17'>And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, according as You have spoken, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.18'>The LORD [is] long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth [generation].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.19'>I beseech You, pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy, and as You have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.20'>And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.21'>But truly, [as] I live, all the earth shall be filled [with] the glory of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.22'>Because all those men who have seen My glory and My miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted Me now these ten times, and have not listened to My voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.23'>surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked Me see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.24'>But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed Me fully, I will bring him into the land into which he went. And his seed shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.25'>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites lived in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.26'>And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.27'>How long [shall I bear with] this evil congregation, which murmurs against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they murmur against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.28'>Say to them, [As] I live, says the LORD, as you have spoken in My ears, so I will do to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.29'>Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.30'>you shall certainly not come into the land which I swore to make you live in, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.31'>But your little ones, which you said should be a prey, I will bring them in and they shall know the land which you have despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.32'>But [as for] you, your bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.33'>And your sons shall feed in the wilderness forty years and bear your fornications, until your dead bodies have wasted in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.34'>According to the number of the days in which you searched the land-- forty days-- each day for a year you shall bear your iniquities, forty years; and you shall know my alienation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.35'>I the LORD have spoken; I will surely do it to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. They shall be destroyed in this wilderness, and there they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.36'>And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report upon the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.37'>even those men that brought up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.38'>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of the men that went to spy out the land, lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.39'>And Moses told these sayings to all the sons of Israel. And the people mourned greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.40'>And they rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which the LORD has promised, for we have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.41'>And Moses said, Why do you now go beyond the command of the LORD, since it shall not be blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.42'>Do not go up, for the LORD [is] not among you. And shall you not be beaten before your enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.43'>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites [are] there before you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.44'>But they presumed to go up to the hill top. But the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, did not leave the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.14.45'>And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who were living in that mountain came down and struck them, and beat them down, to Hormah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.15'>
        <verse osisID='Num.15.1'>And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,</verse>
