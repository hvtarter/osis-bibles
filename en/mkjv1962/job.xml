      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name [was] Job. And that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God and turned aside from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his possessions were seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and feasted in the house of each one on his day. And they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And when they had gone around the day of feasting, Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings [according to] the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. So Job did always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>And a day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD. And Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said to Satan, From where do you come? Then Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said to Satan, Have you set your heart against My servant Job, because [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Have You not made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth Your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has [is] in your power. Only do not lay your hand upon him. And Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And a day came when his sons and his daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the Sabeans fell [on] and took them away. Yea, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he [was] still speaking, there also came [another] and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and destroyed them. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he [was] still speaking, there also came [another] and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands and swooped down upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and have killed the servants with the edge of the sword. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he [was] still speaking, there also came another and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And, behold, a great wind came from the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead. And I only have escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>And Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground and worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And he said, I came naked out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed [be] the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin, nor charge God foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And it happened that a day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD. And Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said to Satan, From where do you come? And Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil? And still he is keeping hold of his integrity, although you moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But indeed put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he [is] in your hand, but save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>And Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a broken piece of pottery to scrape himself with. And he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And his wife said to him, Do you still hold to your integrity? Curse God and die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>And Job's three friends heard [of] all this evil that had come upon him, and they each one came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had met together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and did not know him, they lifted up their voice and wept. And each one tore his robe, and [they] sprinkled dust upon their heads toward Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. And no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that [his] grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job spoke and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in [which] I was born, and the night [which] said, A man-child is conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness. Let not God look upon it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it. Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year, Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to stir up Leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none. Let it not see the eyelids of the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>For it did not shut up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hide sorrow from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die from the womb, come from the womb and expire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees go before me; or why the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with kings and wise men of the earth, who built ruins for themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>or as a hidden untimely birth I would not have been, like infants who did not see light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease [from] troubling, and there the weary are at rest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>the prisoners are at rest together; they hear not the voice of the slave driver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there, and the slave [is] free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to one who is in misery, and life to the bitter [in] soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who is waiting for death, but [it] comes not; and dig for it more than [for] treasures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>They are rejoicing to exultation. They are glad when they can find the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man whose way is hidden, God has made a hedge about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not in safety, nor did I have rest, nor was I quiet; yet trouble comes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>And Eliphaz the Temanite answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>Shall one try a word with you, you [who] are weary? But who can hold back with words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have made the weak hands strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have upheld him who was falling, and you have made strong the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it has come upon you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>[Is] not your reverence your hope? Is not your hope the uprightness of your ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, please, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>As I have seen, the ones who plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the strong lion's cubs are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>And a word was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not tell the form of it. An image [was] before my eyes; silence; then I heard a voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal [man] be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, He puts no trust in His servants, and His angels He charges with folly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much less [in] those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [who] are crushed before the moth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>They are destroyed from morning till evening; they perish forever without anyone caring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, but not with wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now, is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the saints will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation kills the fool, and envy slays the simple one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, nor [is there] any to deliver [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Their harvest the hungry eats, and takes it even out of the thorns; and the snare swallows up their wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring up out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>Truly, I would seek to God, and to God I would put my plea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>[Who is] doing great things, even beyond searching; marvelous things without number,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>who gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the field,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>to set on high those who are low, so that those who mourn may be lifted up [to] safety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>frustrating the plans of the crafty, nor did their hands do wisely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>[He] takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But He saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>And there is hope for the weak, and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, blessed [is] the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For He makes sore, and binds up; He wounds, and His hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver you in six troubles; yea, in seven no evil shall touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine He shall redeem you from death; and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You shall be hidden from the whip of the tongue; neither shall you be afraid of robbery when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine you shall laugh; neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you [shall be] in covenant with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And you shall know that your tent [is in] peace; and you shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>And [you] shall know that your seed [will be] numerous, and your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You shall come to [your] grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Behold this: we have searched it; it is so. Hear it and know for yourself.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>And Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my grief were but weighed, and my ruin laid in the balances together!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, their fury [is] drinking my spirit; the terrors of God are set against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild ass bray [when he has] grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which has no taste be eaten without salt? Or is there taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuses to touch them; they [are] sickening food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my desire, and that God would grant the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that He would loose His hand and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>And it is yet my comfort; yea, I would rejoice in pain, though He did not spare me; for I have not hidden the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What [is] my strength, that I should hope? And what [is] my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>[Is] my strength the strength of stones? Or [is] my flesh bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>[Is] not my help in me? And is wisdom fully driven away from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him who is afflicted, pity is [due] from his friend, but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a torrent; they pass away as the streams of torrents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>[torrents] black from ice, in which the snow hides itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>When they become warm, they go away; when it is hot, they vanish out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing and are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The troops of Tema looked; the companies of Sheba hoped for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came there and were ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>Surely now you are like them; you see [my] casting down, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Give to me? or, Offer a bribe for me from your wealth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand; or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will be silent; and cause me to understand where I have gone astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>Right words are powerful, but what does your arguing argue?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do you intend to criticize words, and the speeches of one who is hopeless, [that are] as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, you cause [anger] to fall on the fatherless, and you dig [a pit] for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>And now, please look on me; for if I lie, [it is] before your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Turn back, please let there be no sin; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there wrong in my tongue? Cannot my taste discern desirable things?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>[Is there] not a warfare to man on earth? [Are] not his days also like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as a hireling looks for his wages,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down, I say, When shall I rise? But the night is long, and I am full of tossing to and fro until the dawning of the day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are ended without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>Remember that my life [is] a breath; my eye shall no more see good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.35.1'>And Elihu answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.2'>Do you think this to [be] right, you [that] say, I am more just than God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.3'>For you say, What will it benefit you? And, What good shall I have more than [if] I had sinned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.4'>I will answer your words, and your friends with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.5'>Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds; they are higher than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.6'>If you sin, what do you do against Him? Or [if] your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.7'>If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.8'>Your wickedness [may hurt] a man like yourself; and your righteousness [may profit] the son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.9'>From the host of tyrannies they cry out; they cry out because of the arm of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.10'>But none says, Where [is] God my Maker, who gives songs in the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.11'>who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.12'>There they cry, but He gives no answer, because of the pride of evildoers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.13'>Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty look on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.14'>How [much less] when you say you do not see Him! Judgment [is] before Him; you are waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.15'>And now, because His anger has not visited, and He does not recognize stupidity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.35.16'>even Job opens his mouth in vanity; he multiplies words without knowledge.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.36'>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.1'>Elihu went on and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.2'>Wait for me a little, and I will show you that [there are] yet words for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.3'>I will bring my knowledge from afar, and I will credit righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.4'>For truly my words [are] not false; He who is perfect in knowledge [is] with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.5'>Behold, God [is] mighty, and does not despise; [He is] mighty in strength of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.6'>He will not keep alive one who is wicked, but gives right to the afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.7'>He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous, but [they are] like kings on the throne; yes, [He] causes them to sit forever, and they are very high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.8'>And if they [are] bound in chains, and are held in cords of affliction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.9'>then He shows them their work, and their sins, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.10'>He also opens their ears to teaching, and commands that they return from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.11'>If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in blessedness, and their years in pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.12'>But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.13'>But the ungodly in heart heap up wrath; they cry not when He binds them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.14'>Their soul dies in youth, and their life [ends] among the sodomites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.15'>He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears by oppression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.16'>And He also would have lured you from the mouth of distress [to] a wide place not cramped; and the setting of your table [would be] full of fatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.17'>But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked; judgment and justice take hold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.18'>For [beware] wrath, that He not lure you with [His] scorn; then a great ransom cannot turn you aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.19'>[If] your cry for help is set in order, then [it will] not [be]. in distress, but with all the forces of strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.20'>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.21'>Beware, do not turn to iniquity; for this you have chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.22'>Behold, God is exalted in His power; who teaches like Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.23'>Who has appointed Him His way; or who can say, You have done wrong?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.24'>Remember that you magnify His work of which men have sung;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.25'>every man has seen it; man may see [it] afar off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.26'>Behold, God [is] great, and we do not know; the number of His years cannot be searched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.27'>For He draws up the drops of water; they distill rain into mist,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.28'>which the clouds pour down [and] drop on man plentifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.29'>Also can [any] understand the spreading of the clouds, or the crashing of His canopy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.30'>Behold, He spreads His light on it, and He covers the bottom of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.31'>For by them He judges the people; He gives plenty of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.32'>He covers His hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.36.33'>its thunder declares concerning Him, and the cattle, concerning what is coming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.37'>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.1'>My heart trembles at this also, and it leaps out of its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.2'>Listen carefully to the thunder of His voice, and the rumbling that comes out of His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.3'>He loosens it under the whole heavens, and His lightning to the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.4'>After it a voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty, and He will not hold them when His voice is heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.5'>God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things, and we do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.6'>For He says to the snow, Fall [on] the earth; also to the shower of rain, and to the shower of [heavy] rains in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.7'>He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.8'>Then the beast goes into its lair, and it remains in its dens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.9'>Out of the storeroom comes the tempest; and cold from scattering winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.10'>By the breath of God ice is given; and the expanse of waters is frozen tight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.11'>Also He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters the lightning cloud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.12'>and it is turned around by His guidance, so that they may do whatever He commands them on the face of the world in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.13'>Whether as a whip, or for His land, or for mercy, He finds it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.14'>Listen to this, Job; stand still, and consider the wonderful works of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.15'>Do you know when God placed them, and caused the lightning of His cloud to shine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.16'>Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wonderful works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.17'>You whose clothes warm when He quiets the earth from the south wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.18'>Have you beat out the expanse with Him, hard like a cast mirror?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.19'>Teach us what we shall say to Him; [for] because of darkness we cannot arrange our case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.20'>Shall it be told Him that I would speak? If a man speaks, surely he shall be swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.21'>And now men cannot look upon the light; it [is] in the clouds; but the wind passes and clears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.22'>Golden [splendor] comes out of the north; God [is] awesome in His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.23'>The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, [is] exalted in power; and to judgment and overflowing righteousness He does no violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.37.24'>Therefore, men fear Him; He does not respect any [who are] wise in heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.38.1'>And the LORD answered Job out of the tempest, and said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.38.3'>Now gird up your loins like a man; for I will ask of you, and you teach Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.38.4'>Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell if you have understanding!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.38.9'>When I made the clouds its robe, and darkness its navel-band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.38.10'>and set My limit on it, and set bars and doors,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.38.14'>It is turned like clay [under] a seal; and they stand forth like a garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.38.15'>And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.38.16'>Have you gone to the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.38.24'>How [is] it, way the light distributed, [and how does] the east wind spread itself on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.38.25'>Who has cut a channel for the flood, or a way for the thunderclaps;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.4'>Their young ones are strong, they multiply with grain; they go forth and do not return to them again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.7'>He scorns the turmoil of the city; he does not hear the driver's shouts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.39.8'>He seeks out mountains [for] his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.14'>For she leaves her eggs to the earth, and lets them warm in the dust,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.16'>She treats her young roughly, as if not hers; for her labor [is] vanity without fear;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.18'>At the time she lifts herself up on high, she scorns the horse and its rider.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.39.27'>Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on high?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.39.28'>He lives and stays [on the] rock, on the crag of the rock and [the] strong place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>Out of his mouth go burning torches, sparks of fire leap out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as [out] of a boiling pot [fired] by reeds.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>And Job answered the LORD and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that You can do all, and not [any] purpose is withheld from You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who [is] he who hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken what I did not understand; [things] too wonderful for me; yea, I did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech You, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You will cause me to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye has seen You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I despise [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it happened after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends. For you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job [has].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>And now take to yourselves seven young bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. And My servant Job will pray for you. Surely I will lift up his face so as not to do with you [according to your] foolishness, in that you have not spoken of Me what is right, like My servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, [and] Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the LORD commanded them. The LORD also accepted the face of Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. Also the LORD added to Job all that [had been his], to double.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>And came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had known him before. And they ate bread with him in his house, and consoled him and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought on him. Each one also gave him a piece of money, and each one a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And the LORD blessed the latter [days] of Job more than the beginning. For he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land there [were] not found women as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>And Job died, [being] old and full of days.</verse>
