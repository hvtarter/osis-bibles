      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which He had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>about His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was marked out the Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from [the] dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>by whom we have received grace and apostleship, to obedience to the faith among all nations, for His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom you also are the called-out ones of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>to all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be] saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always in my prayers, making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to you for the establishing of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>And this is to be comforted together with you by our mutual faith, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, and was kept back until the present; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the foreigners, both to the wise and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as is in me [lies], I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are at Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is [the] power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>because the thing which may be known of God is clearly revealed within them, for God revealed [it] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the unseen things of Him from [the] creation of [the] world [are] clearly seen, being realized by the things that are made, [even] His eternal power and Godhead, for them to be without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. But [they] became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing to be wise, they became fools</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of [their] hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>For they changed the truth of God into a lie, and they worshiped and served the created thing more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause, God gave them up to dishonorable affections. For even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another; males with males working out shamefulness, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And even as they did not think fit to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do the things not right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; [being] full of envy, murder, quarrels, deceit, evil habits, [becoming] whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>backbiters, haters of God, insolent, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>undiscerning, perfidious, without natural] affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who, knowing the righteous order of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but have pleasure in those practicing [them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, everyone who judges; for in that in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, for you who judge do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But know that the judgment of God is according to truth on those who practice such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And, O man, the [one] judging those who do such things, and practice them, do you think this, that you shall escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, and the forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your hardness and your impenitent heart, do you treasure up wrath for yourself in a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will render to each according to his works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>indeed to those who with patience [in] good work [are] seeking for glory, and honor, and incorruptibility, everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to those who indeed disobeying the truth out] of self-seeking, and obeying unrighteousness, will be] anger and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who has worked out evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But He [will give] glory, honor and peace to every man who works good, to [the] Jew first and also to [the] Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of faces with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as sinned without Law will also perish without Law. And as many as have sinned within Law shall be judged through Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For it is not the hearers of the Law who [are] just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when the nations, who do not have the Law, do by nature the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law unto themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and the thoughts between one another accusing or even excusing one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in a day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the Law, and boast in God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know [His] will and approve the things excelling, being instructed out of the Law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and persuading yourselves to be a guide of the blind, a light to those in darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Therefore the [one] teaching another, do you not teach yourself? The [one] preaching not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>The [one] saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The [one] detesting idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>[You] who boast in Law, do you dishonor God through breaking the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision truly profits if you keep [the] Law, but if you are a transgressor of the Law, circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If then the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the Law, shall it not judge you, who through letter and circumcision [become] transgressors of the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who [is one] outwardly, nor [is] circumcision that outwardly in flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he [is] a Jew who [is one] inwardly, and circumcision [is] of the heart; in spirit and not in letter; whose praise [is] not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>Then what [is] the superiority of the Jew? Or what [is] the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much, by every way! Chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what? If some did not believe, will not their unbelief nullify the faith of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Let it not be! But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That You might be justified in Your sayings, and will overcome when You are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Is] God unrighteous who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Let it not be! For then how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if in my lie the truth has more abounded to His glory why am I still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And not [rather], (as we are wrongly accused, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do bad things that good may come? [Their] condemnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Do we excel? No, in no way; for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks all [with] being under sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>as it is written: There is none righteous, no not one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>there is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way, [they] have together become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat [is] an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit, [the] poison of asps [is] under their lips;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>their feet [are] swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>destruction and misery [are] in their way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and the way of peace they did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>But we know that whatever things the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law; so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be under judgment before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>because by the works of the Law none of all flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law [is] the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from Law, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ, toward all and upon all those who believe. For there is no difference,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God has set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness through the passing by of the sins that had taken place before, in the forbearance of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for the display of His righteousness at this time, for Him to be just and, forgiving the [one] being of the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Then where [is] the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or [is He] the God of the Jews only, and not also of the nations? Yes, of the nations also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since [it is] one God who will justify circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make the Law void through faith? Let it not be! But we establish the Law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we say that our father Abraham has found, according to flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has a boast; but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>But to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him not working, but believing on Him justifying the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Even as David also says of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>[saying], Blessed are those whose lawlessnesses are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>blessed [is] the man to whom [the] Lord will in no way impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>[Is] this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it reckoned? Being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith [while still] uncircumcised; so that he might be [the] father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for righteousness to be imputed to them also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and a father of circumcision to those not of the circumcision only, but also to those walking by the steps of the faith of our father Abraham during uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should be the heir of the world [was] not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they of the Law [are] heirs, faith is made void and the promise is made of no effect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>because the Law works out wrath, for where no law is, [there is] no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore [it is] of faith so that [it might be] according to grace; for the promise to be made sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the Law, but to that also which is of  the] faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(as it has been written, I have made you a father of many nations) --before God, whom he believed, who makes the dead live, and calls the things [which] do not exist as [though they] do exist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>[For he] who beyond hope believed on hope for him to become the father of many nations (according to that which was spoken, So your seed shall be).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body already dead (being about a hundred years old) or the deadening of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully persuaded that what God had promised, He was also able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for him alone that it was imputed to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for us also to whom it is to be imputed, to the ones believing on Him who has raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered because of our offenses and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>Through Him we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice on the hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only [this], but we glory in afflictions also, knowing that afflictions work out patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience [works out] experience, and experience [works out] hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope does not make [us] ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through [the] Holy Spirit given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For we yet being without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For one will with difficulty die for a righteous one, yet perhaps one would even dare to die for a good one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commends His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if [when] we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only [so], but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, even as through one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed on all men inasmuch as all sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>for until the Law sin was in [the] world, but sin is not imputed [when] there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is the type of Him who was to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>but the free gift [shall] not [be] also like the offense. For if by the offense of the one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace; which [is] of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the free gift [shall] not [be] as by one having sinned; (for indeed the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offenses to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they who receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Therefore as by one offense [sentence came] on all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of One the free gift [came] to all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But the Law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that as sin has reigned to death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we were buried with Him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from [the] dead by the glory of the Father; even so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been joined together in the likeness of His death, we shall also be [in the likeness] of His resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [Him] in order that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who died has been justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that when Christ was raised from [the] dead, He dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that He died, He died to sin once; but in that He lives, He lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise count yourselves also to be truly dead to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Do not yield your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God, as [one] alive from [the] dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law, but under grace? Let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that to whom you yield yourselves [as] slaves for obedience, you are slaves to him whom you obey; whether it is of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks [be] to our God that you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from [the] heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Then being made free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak in the manner of men because of the weakness of your flesh; for as you have yielded your members [as] slaves to uncleanness, and to lawless act unto lawless act, even so now yield your members as slaves to righteousness unto holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit did you have then [in those things] of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things [is] death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or are you ignorant, brothers; for I speak to those who know the Law; that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman was bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband is dead, she is set free from the law of [her] husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then [if], while [her] husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, [so that] she is no adulteress by becoming another man's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ so that you should be married to Another, [even] to Him raised from [the] dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin worked in our members through the law to bring forth fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we having been set free from the Law, having died [to that] in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not [in] oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? [Is] the law sin? Let it not be said! But I did not know sin except through the law. For also I did not know lust except the law said, You shall not lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all kinds of lust. For apart from law sin [was] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive without the law once. But when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment, which [was] to life, was found [to be] death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed [me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So indeed the Law [is] holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Then has that [which is] good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear [to be] sin, working death in me by [that which is] good; in order that sin might become exceedingly sinful by the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I know not. For what I desire, that I do not do; but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing. For to will is present with me, but [how] to perform [that which is] good I do not find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not will, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if I do what I do not desire, [it is] no more I working it out, but sin dwelling in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law: when I will to do the right, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin being in my members.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>But the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they who are according to the flesh mind the things of flesh, but they who are according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For to be carnally minded [is] death, but to be spiritually minded [is] life and peace</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the carnal mind [is] enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can [it be].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in [the] Spirit, if [the] Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone has not [the] Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if we are children, then we are heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; so that if we suffer with [Him], we may also be glorified together.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but because of Him who subjected [it] on hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>And we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen is not hope; for what anyone sees, why does he also hope [for it] ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which we do not see, [then] we wait for it with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And He searching the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who [is] he condemning? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather also [who is] raised, who is also at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? [Shall] tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>For if the firstfruit [is] holy, the lump [is] also [holy]; and if the root [is] holy, also the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and became a sharer of the root and the fatness of the olive tree with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>do not boast against the branches. But if you boast, [it is] not you [that] bears the root, but the root bears you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say then, The branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not [be] high-minded, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God did not spare the natural branches, [fear] lest He also may not spare you either!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold then [the] kindness, and [the] severity of God; on those having fallen, severity; but on you, kindness, if you continue in the kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And those also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of the natural wild olive [tree], and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive [tree]; how much more these [being] according to nature will be grafted into [their] own olive-tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, lest you should be wise within yourselves; that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the nations has comes in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>For this [is] My covenant with them, when I have taken away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>Indeed as regards the gospel, [they are] enemies for your sakes. But as regards the election, [they are] beloved for the fathers' sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the free gifts and calling of God [are] without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you also then disbelieved God, but now have been shown mercy through their disbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>even so these also have not believed now, so that through your mercy they may also obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has shut up all in unbelief, so that He might show mercy to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O [the] depth of [the] riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable [are] His judgments, and His ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, or who became His counselor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Or who first gave to Him, and it will be repaid to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of Him and through Him and to Him [are] all things; to Him be glory forever! Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, [which is] your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, in order to prove by you what [is] that good and pleasing and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think. But set your mind to be right-minded, even as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For even as we have many members in one body, and all members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we the many are one body in Christ, and each one members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Then having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, if prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>or he who exhorts, in the encouragement; or he who shares, in simplicity; or he who takes the lead, in diligence; or he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>[Let] love [be] without hypocrisy, shrinking from evil, cleaving to good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>in brotherly love to one another, loving fervently, having led one another in honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>As to diligence, not slothful, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>rejoicing in hope, patient in affliction, steadfastly continuing in prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>distributing to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and do not curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with rejoicing ones, and weep with weeping ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>minding the same thing toward one another, not minding high things, but yielding to the lowly. Do not be wise within yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Repay no one evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If [it is] possible, as far as [is] in you, being in peace with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [is] Mine, I will repay, says [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore if your enemy hungers, feed him. If he thirsts, give him drink. For [in so] doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority but of God; the authorities that exist are ordained by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>So that the one resisting the authority resists the ordinance of God; and the ones who resist will receive judgment to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For the rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the bad. And do you desire to be not afraid of the authority? Do the good, and you shall have praise from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For it is a servant of God to you for good. For if you practice evil, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; for it is a servant of God, a revenger for wrath on him who does evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore [you] must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For because of this you also pay taxes. For they are God's servants, always giving attention to this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Therefore give to all [their] dues; to the [one due] tax, the tax; tribute to whom tribute [is due], fear to whom fear [is due], and honor to whom honor [is due].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For: Do not commit adultery; do not murder; do not steal; do not bear false witness; do not lust; and if [there is] any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no ill to its neighbor, therefore love [is] the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>This also, knowing the time, that [it is] already time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation [is] nearer than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night [is] far spent, the day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk becomingly, as in [the] day; not in carousings and drinking; not in co-habitation and lustful acts; not in strife and envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take thought beforehand for the lusts of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>And receive him who is weak in the faith, [but] not to judgments of [your] thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For indeed one believes to eat all things; but being weak, [another] eats vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat; and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you that judges another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. But he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One indeed esteems a day above [another] day; and [another] esteems every day [alike]. Let each one be fully assured in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who regards the day regards [it] to the Lord; and he not regarding the day, does not regard [it] to the Lord. He who eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, does not eat to [the Lord, and gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For both if we live, we live to [the] Lord; and if we die, we die to [the] Lord. Therefore both if we live, and if we die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For this Christ both died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord both of [the] dead and living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But why do you judge your brother? Or also why do you despise your brother? For all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written,  As] I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each one of us will give account concerning himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Then let us not judge one another any more, but rather judge this, not to put a stumbling-block or an offense toward his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and am persuaded in [the] Lord Jesus, that nothing by itself [is] common; except to him who esteems anything to be common, [it is] common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if your brother is grieved with [your] food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Then do not let your good be spoken evil of,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he who serves Christ in these things [is] well-pleasing to God, and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>So then let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for building up one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not undo the work of God for food. Truly, all things indeed [are] clean, but [it is] bad to the man eating because of a stumbling-block.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [anything] by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Do you have faith? Have [it] to yourself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But, the one doubting, if he eats, [he] has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>Then we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of us please [his] neighbor for [his] good, to building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, so that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>And may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>so that with one mind [and] one mouth you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore receive one another as Christ also received us, to [the] glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>And I say, Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises [made] to the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and that the nations might glorify God for [His] mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess to You in the nations, and I will praise Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again He says, Rejoice, O nations, with His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, Praise the Lord, all the nations, and praise Him, all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall rise to reign over the nations, in Him shall the nations trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope through the power of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But, brothers, I wrote to you boldly, as reminding you in part, because of the grace that is given to me by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the nations, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, being sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>Therefore I have boasting in Christ Jesus [as to] the things pertaining to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ did not work out by me for [the] obedience of the nations in word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>in power of miracles and wonders, in power of [the] Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem, and all around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>Yea, so I have been eager to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but as it is written, To whom nothing was said about Him, they shall see. And they who have not heard shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For this cause I also have been greatly hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I may go into Spain, I will come to you. For [in] traveling through I hope to see you, and to be set forward there by you, if first I may be filled of you in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>Truly it has pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the nations have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in fleshly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Therefore when I have completed this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will come by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of [the] blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>But I exhort you, brothers, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from those disbelieving in Judea, and that my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be accepted by the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>so that [I may] come to you with joy by [the] will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</verse>
