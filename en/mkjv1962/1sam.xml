      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>And there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim from the hills of Ephraim, and his name [was] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives, the name of the one [was] Hannah, and the name of the second, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city from year to year, to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And the time came that Elkanah offered, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But to Hannah he gave one double portion, for he loved Hannah. But the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her foe also provoked her grievously, in order to make her tremble, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her. And she wept and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? [Am] I not better to you than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. And Eli the priest sat on the seat by the side post of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she [was] in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sorely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow and said, O, Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your handmaid and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but will give to Your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it happened as she continued praying before the LORD, Eli noticed her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. And Eli thought she had become drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered, No, my lord, I [am] a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have neither drunk wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Do not count your handmaid for a daughter of wickedness, for out of the abundance of my meditation and grief I have spoken until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>And Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant [to you] your petition that you have asked of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer [sad].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it happened when the time had come around, Hannah conceived and bore a son and called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up. For she said to her husband, Until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him so that he may appear before the LORD and stay there forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to you. Stay until you have weaned him. Only may the LORD establish His word. So the woman stayed and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls and one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. And the child [was] young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they killed a bull, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, O, my lord, [as] your soul lives, my lord, I [am] the woman who stood by you here, praying to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this boy I was praying, and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>And I have returned him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he shall be given to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in Your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>[There is] none holy as the LORD, for there is none beside You. Neither [is there] any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so very proudly. Remove arrogance out of your mouth, for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty [are] broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>[They that were] full have hired themselves out for bread, and they that were hungry ceased; yea, while the barren has borne seven, and she who had many sons has languished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD kills and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD takes away, and He gives riches; He brings low; yea, He lifts up high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust; He lifts up the needy from the dunghill to set [them] among princes; yea, He causes them to inherit a throne of honor; for to the LORD [are] the pillars of the earth; and He sets the habitable world on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He keeps the feet of his saints, and the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The foes of the LORD shall be broken to pieces. He thunders in the heavens upon them. The LORD shall judge the ends of the earth. And He shall give strength to His king, and exalts the horn of His anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child served the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>And the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial. They did not know the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priests' custom with the people [was]: If any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And [he] stuck [it] into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Yea, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest. For he will not have boiled flesh from you, but raw!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And [if] any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat at once, and then take as your soul desires, then he would answer him, No! But you shall give now! And if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD. For men despised the offering of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>And Samuel served before the LORD, a child girded [with] a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother made him a little coat, and brought [it] to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, May the LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is loaned to the LORD. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah so that she conceived, and she bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who gathered [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings by all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons, for [it is] no good report that I hear. You make the LORD's people to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sins against another, the judge shall judge him. But if a man sins against the LORD, who shall plead for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel went on [growing] both in stature and in good [looks], both with the LORD and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, So says the LORD: Did I plainly appear to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel [to be] My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? And did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire from the sons of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded [in My] house? [Do you] honor your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>And the LORD God of Israel says, I said indeed, Your house and the house of your father should walk before Me forever. But now the LORD says, Be it far from Me! For those who honor Me I will honor, and those that think little of Me shall be lightly regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come when I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father's house, so that no old man shall be in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And you shall see an adversary [in My] house, in all the good which he does with Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And that man of yours [whom] I shall not cut off from My altar, shall be left in order to make your eyes fail, and to grieve your heart. And all the increase of your house shall die [young] men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this [shall be] a sign to you, which shall come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day both of them shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up a faithful priest to Myself, one who shall do according to what [is] in My heart and in My mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall be that everyone who is left in your house shall come [and] bow down to him for a piece of silver and a piece of bread. And [they] shall say, Please put me into one of the priests' offices so that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel served the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days. [There was] no open vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it happened at that time, when Eli [was] lying down in his place, and his eyes began to become dim so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And the lamp of God had not gone out. And Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>And the LORD called Samuel. And he answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here [am] I. For you called me. And he said, I did not call. Go and lie down again. And he went to lie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for you called me. And he answered, I did not call, my son. Go back, lie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>And Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again, the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, Here [am] I, for you called me. And Eli saw that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if [One] calls you, you shall say, Speak, LORD, for Your servant hears. And Samuel went to lie down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel! Then Samuel answered, Speak, for Your servant hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will confirm to Eli all that which I have spoken as to his house, beginning and making an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile and he did not restrain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>And Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What [is] the word which He has said to you? Please do not hide [it] from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide a thing from me of all the words that He said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It [is] the LORD; let Him do what seems good to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel [was] established to be a prophet of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh. For the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel was [revealed] to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer. And the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in order against Israel. And the battle was joined. And Israel was beaten before the Philistines. And they killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people had come to the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD beaten us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, so that when it comes among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>And the people sent to Shiloh in order to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts from there, [the ark] which dwells [between] the cherubs. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And it happened when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they saw that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp, And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been a thing like this before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These [are] the gods that struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong and fight like men, O, Philistines, so that you may not be servants to the Hebrews, [as] they have been to you. Be men and fight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was beaten, and each one of them fled into his tent. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell thirty thousand footmen of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken. And Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And a man of Benjamin ran out of the army. And he came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And he came in, and behold, Eli sat on a seat by the wayside watching. For his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told [it], all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What [is] the noise of this tumult? And the man hurried in and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>And Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I [am] he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did the matter go, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people also. And also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it happened when he spoke of the ark of God, he fell backward off the seat, by the side of the gate. And his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, ready to be delivered. And when she heard the report that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed, for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said to her, Do not fear, for you have borne a son. But she did not answer, nor set her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God had been taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it beside Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when those of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon [had] fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon [had] fallen on his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands, [were cut off upon the threshold. Only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>And neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>And the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He destroyed them and struck them with hemorrhoids, Ashdod and its borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And the men of Ashdod saw that [it was] so. And they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us. For His hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them. And they said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.2'>But Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David very much. And Jonathan told David, saying, My father Saul seeks to kill you. And now please be careful until morning, and stay in a secret [place], and hide yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you [are], and I will talk about you with my father. And I will tell you what I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Do not let the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works [are] very good toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the LORD worked out a great salvation for all Israel. You saw and rejoiced! Why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. And Saul swore, [As] the LORD lives, he shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter. And they fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And the evil spirit from the LORD was on Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David played with [his] hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Saul thought to strike David even to the wall with the spear. But he burst forth from Saul's presence, and he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>Saul also sent messengers to David's house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And David's wife Michal told him saying, If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you shall be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>And Michal let David down through a window. And he left and hurried away, and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>And Michal took an image and laid [it] in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' [hair] at its head, and covered it with a cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He [is] sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed so that I may kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>And the messengers came in, and behold, the image [was] in the bed with a pillow of goats' [hair] at its head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away my enemy so that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>And David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel, to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived in Naioth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>And they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers the third time, and they prophesied also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>And he also went to Ramah, and came to a great well in Sechu. And he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And [one] said, Behold, at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God was on him also, and going on he went and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel, even he. And he lay down disrobed all that day and all that night. Because of this they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What [is] my iniquity, and what my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said to him, Far be it. You shall not die! Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small that he will not show to me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It [is] not [so].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And David swore again and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in your eyes. And he said, Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be full of sorrow. But truly [as] the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, only a step [is] between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>And Jonathan said to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will even do for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David said to Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow [is] the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go so that I may hide myself in the field until the third day at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If your father misses me at all, then say, David earnestly asked me that he might run to his city Bethlehem. For [there is] a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he says so, [It is] well, peace [will be] to your servant, but if he is very angry, be sure that evil is determined by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>And you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is any iniquity in me, kill me yourself. For why should you bring me to your father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you. For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come on you, then would I not tell you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then David said to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? Or what [if] your father answers you roughly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go into the field. And both of them went out into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said to David, By the LORD, the God of Israel, when I search my father about this time tomorrow [or] the third [day], behold, [if there is] good toward David, then shall I not send to you and reveal [it in your ear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>So may the LORD do to Jonathan and more if it seem good to my father [to do] you evil, then I will reveal [it] in your ear and send you away, and you may go in peace. And may the LORD be with you, as He was with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And you shall not only show me the kindness of the LORD while I still live, so that I do not die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David, every one, from the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan covenanted with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require [it] at the hand of David's enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>And Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow [is] the new moon. And you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And on the third [day] you shall quickly come down and shall come there to the place where you were hidden in the day of the deed. And [you] shall remain near the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows on the side, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And behold, I will send a lad, [saying], Go find the arrows. If I carefully say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them, then you may come, for there is peace to you, and no hurt, [as] the LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say this to the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond you, go your way, for the LORD has sent you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And [as to] the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, may the LORD be between you and me forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>And David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon had come, the king sat down by the food to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat on his seat as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>And Saul did not speak anything that day. For he thought, Something has happened to him; he [is] not clean. Surely he [is] not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it happened on the next day, the second of the month, David's place was empty. And Saul said to his son Jonathan, Why does the son of Jesse not come to the meal, neither yesterday nor today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked of me [to go] to Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>and he said, Please send me away, for we have a family sacrifice in the city. And my brother commanded me [to be] there. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I pray you let me get away and see my brothers. And he does not come to the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>And Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse, rebellious [woman], do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. And now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why shall he be killed? What has he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul threw a spear at him to strike him, and by this Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it happened, in the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David. And a little lad [was] with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to this lad, Run now, find the arrows which I shoot. As the lad ran, he shot an arrow, causing it to pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad and said, [Is] not the arrow beyond you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Hurry, make haste, do not stand. And Jonathan's lad gathered the arrow and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, Go, bring [to] the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>As soon as the lad had gone, David rose from the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed one another, and wept with one another, until David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace because we have both sworn in the name of the LORD, saying, The Lord shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.43'>And he rose and went away. And Jonathan went [into] the city.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>And David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why [are] you alone, and no man with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business and has said to me, Let no man know anything [of] the business about which I send you, and what I have sent you. And I have sent servants to such and such a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>And therefore, what is under your hand? Give five [loaves] of bread in my hand, or what there is to be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David and said, [There is] no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest and said to him, Truly women [have been] kept from us for about three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and [in] a way the holy [bread] is common. Also surely today it is sanctified in the vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>And the priest gave him holy [bread]. For there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence that was taken from before the LORD, in order to put hot bread in on the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>And a man from the servants of Saul [was] there that day, held before the LORD. And his name [was] Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under your hand spear or sword? For I have not brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business needed haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it [is] wrapped in a cloth under the ephod, if you will take, take it for yourself, for there is no other here except that one. And David said, There is none like that. Give it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the servants of Achish said to him, [Is] not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>And he changed his behavior before them, and pretended himself to be mad in their hands, and marked on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>Then Achish said to his servants, Lo, you see the man is mad. Why have you brought him to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>Do I have need of mad men, that you have brought this one to show madness in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>And David left there and escaped to the cave Adullam. And his brothers and all his father's house heard, and went down to him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>And every man in distress, and every man who had a creditor, and every man bitter of soul, gathered themselves to him. And he became commander over them. And about four hundred men were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth [and be] with you until I know what God will do for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>And he brought them before the king of Moab. And they lived with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not stay in the stronghold. Leave and go into the land of Judah. And David left and came into the forest of Hareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>And Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. And Saul was staying in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand. And all his servants were standing about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>And Saul said to his servants standing by him, Now hear, Benjamites, will the son of Jesse give to any of you fields and vineyards, [and] make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.8'>But all of you have conspired against me, and none of you was revealing [in] my ear when my son cut [a covenant] with the son of Jesse? And not one of you is sorry for me, even [to reveal in my ear that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.9'>And answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.10'>And he asked of the LORD for him and gave him food and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.11'>And the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests in Nob. And they came, all of them, to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.12'>And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I [am], my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>And Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have asked of God for him, that he should rise against me to lie in wait, as at this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who [is so] faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and [who] goes at your bidding, and who is honorable in your house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>Have I today begun to ask of God for him? Be it far from me. Do not let the king charge a thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, more or less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.16'>And the king said, Ahimelech, you shall surely die, you and all your father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.17'>And the king said to the guard that stood around him, Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also [is] with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not reveal it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall on the priests of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.18'>And the king said to Doeg, You turn and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and fell on the priests. And on that day he killed eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.19'>And he struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and babes, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.20'>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.21'>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.22'>And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite [was] there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused the death of all the persons of your father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.23'>Stay with me, and do not fear. For he who seeks my life seeks your life. But you [shall be] in safekeeping with me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.1'>And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.2'>And David asked of the LORD, saying, Shall I go? And shall I strike these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.3'>And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.4'>And David inquired of the LORD once again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down [to] Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines. And they led away their cattle and struck them with a great slaughter. And David saved the people of Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.6'>And it happened when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled [to] David to Keilah, he came down [with] an ephod in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.7'>And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hands, for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.11'>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as Your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beg of You, tell Your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.12'>And David said, Will the men of Keilah shut up me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will shut [you up].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>And David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah and went wherever they could go. And it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah. And he did not go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And David stayed in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained in the stronghold in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul looked for him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David [was] in the wilderness of Ziph in a woods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. For what did you see? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said to her, What [is] his form? And she said, An old man comes up, and he is covered with a cloak. And Saul saw that it was Samuel, and [he] bowed [his] face to the ground, and prostrated himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed, for the Philistines are warring against me. And God has left me and does not answer me any more, neither by prophets nor by dreams. And I have called you so that you may make known to me what I should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>And Samuel said, Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has left you and has become your enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And the LORD has done for Himself as He spoke by me. For the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and [is] giving it to your neighbor, to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you now.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>And Saul immediately fell headlong on the earth, and was sorely afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all day nor all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was sorely troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>And now please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a bit of bread before you and eat, so that you may have strength when you go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, forced him, and the woman also. And he listened to their voices and arose from the earth and sat on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat calf in the house. And she hurried and killed it, and took flour and kneaded [it], and baked unleavened [bread] with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And [she] brought [it] before Saul, and before his servants. And they ate, and rose up and went away that night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands. But David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>And the rulers of the Philistines said, What [are] these Hebrews [doing]? And Achish said to the rulers of the Philistines, Is this not David the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me [these] days, or  these] years. And I have not found anything [evil] in him from the day he fell away until today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>And the rulers of the Philistines were angry with him. And the Philistine rulers said to him, Send the man back, and he shall return to his place where you have appointed him. And he shall not go down with us to battle, and shall not become an enemy to us in battle. For with what should he reconcile himself to his master? [Should it] not [be] with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>[Is] not this David, of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, Saul killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>And return now, and go in peace so that you do not displease the lords of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you to this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you [are] good in my sight, like an angel of God. But the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>And now, rise up early in the morning with your master's servants who have come with you. And as soon as you have light, depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>And David and his men rose up early to leave in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up [to] Jezreel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>And it happened when David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had invaded the south and Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>And they had seized the women in it. They did not kill any, either small or great, but carried them away and went on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>And David and his men came to the city, and behold, [it was] burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>And David and the people with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And David's two wives had been seized, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the [former] wife of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And it greatly distressed David, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, each one for his sons and for his daughters. But David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, Please bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod there to David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him. For he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said to him, Whose [are] you? And where do you come from? And he said, I am an Egyptian youth, servant to an Amalekite. And my master left me because three days ago I fell sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We raided the south of the Cherethites, and on that [belonging] to Judah, and on the south of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag with fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And when he had brought him down, behold, [they were] spread abroad on all the earth, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>And every evil and worthless man of the men who went with David answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them from a thing the spoil that we have seized, except to every man his wife and his sons. Let them take them, and go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>And David said, My brothers, you shall not do so with that which the LORD has given us. For He has protected us, and has delivered into our hand the company that came against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>For who will listen to you in this matter? But as his part [is] that goes down to the battle, so [shall be] his part that stays by the stuff. They shall divide alike.</verse>
