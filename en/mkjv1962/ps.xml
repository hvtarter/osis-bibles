        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>You shall destroy those who speak lies; the LORD will despise the bloody and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But I, in the abundance of Your grace, I will come [into] Your house; I will worship in Your fear toward Your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For [there is] no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is wickedness; their throat [is] an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Hold them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul also is exceedingly troubled; but You, O LORD, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O LORD, return; deliver my soul; save me for Your mercy's sake.</verse>
