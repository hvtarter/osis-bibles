      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in [the] beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one [thing] came into being that has come into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God; his name [was] John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This one came as a witness, to bear witness concerning the Light, so that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>He was the true Light; [He] enlightens every man coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and the world did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to [His] own, and [His] own received Him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received Him, He gave to them authority to become the children of God, to those who believe on His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of bloods, nor of [the] will of [the] flesh, nor of [the] will of man, but [were born] of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us. And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of [the] Father, full of grace and of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was [He] of whom I spoke: He who comes after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And out of His fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law came through Moses, [but] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, Who are you so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they who were sent were from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him and said, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor that Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but One stands among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is who, coming after me, who has been before me; of whom I am not worthy to loosen the thong of His sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John sees Jesus coming to him and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is He of whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He preceded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I did not know Him, but that He be revealed to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven like a dove, and He abode on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water, that One said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He is the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day afterward, John stood with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking upon Jesus as He walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is called, being translated, Teacher), where do you live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He lived, and stayed with Him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found [his] own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being translated, the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus saw him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is, A stone).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day after, Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee. And He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses wrote in the law and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, Can there be any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater [things] than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Jesus and His disciples were both invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were six stone waterpots there, according to the purification of the Jews, each containing two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to [the] brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And He said to them, Now draw out and carry it to the master of the feast. And they carried [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wine (and did not know where it was from, but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And [he] said to him, Every man at the beginning sets forth good wine, and when men have drunk well, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And [it] revealed His glory. And His disciples believed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples. And they did not stay there many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And when He had made a scourge of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, also the sheep and the oxen. And He poured out the money-changers' money and overthrew the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here. Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house has eaten Me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show us, since you do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>Then the Jews said, This temple was forty-six years building, and will you rear it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But He spoke of the temple of His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>Therefore when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>And as He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the miracles which He did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and did not need that anyone should testify of man. For He knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>And there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no [man] can do these miracles which you do unless God is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second [time] into his mother's womb and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice, but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what we know and testify what we have seen. And you do not receive our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how shall you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one has ascended up to Heaven except He who came down from Heaven, the Son of man who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>But even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>so that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes on Him is not condemned, but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the condemnation, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who practices truth comes to the Light so that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And [He] stayed there with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John was also baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John had not yet been cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, He baptizes, and all come to Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>And John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves bear witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is [the] bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Then my joy is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I [must] decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who has received His testimony has set his seal to this, that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes on the Son has everlasting life, and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Therefore when the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And it was necessary for Him to go through Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Then He came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with [His] journey, sat thus upon the well. [It] was about [the] sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask a drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and [he] whom you now have is not your husband. In that you spoke truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you shall neither worship the Father in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know, we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God [is] a spirit, and they who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When He has come, He will tell us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, I AM, the One] speaking to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this His disciples came and marveled that He talked with the woman. However, no one said, What do You seek, or why do You talk with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come see a man who told me all things that I ever did. Is this One] not the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>And they went out of the city and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the meantime His disciples were asking Him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Therefore the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him [anything] to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of [Him] who sent Me and to finish His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, It is] yet four months, and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white to harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to life eternal, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>And in this is the saying true, One sows and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Other men labored, and you have entered into their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed upon Him because of the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I ever did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>Then as the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him that He would stay with them. And He stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of His own word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying, for we have heard [Him] ourselves and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in [his] own native-place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Then when He had come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When He heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him that He would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told [him], saying, Your son lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he asked of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said to him, Yesterday [at the] seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This [is] the second miracle Jesus did, when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is a pool at the Sheep Gate at Jerusalem, which [is] called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, of blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water. Then whoever first stepped in after the troubling of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying, and knowing that he had spent much time, He said to him, Do you desire to be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The infirm man answered Him, Sir, when the water is troubled, I have no one to put me into the pool. But while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus says to him, Rise, take up your bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked. And it was a sabbath on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Therefore the Jews said to him who had been healed, It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to take up the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, He who made me whole said to me, Take up your bed and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>And he did not know Him who had cured him, for Jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more lest a worse thing come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Then, because of this, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was His father, making Himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do. For whatever things He does, these also the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all the things that He Himself does. And He will show Him greater works than these, so that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, even so the Son of man makes alive whomever He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>so that all should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they who hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to the Son to have life within Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing of My own self. As I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of [the] Father who has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not receive testimony from man, but these things I say so that you might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and shining light, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater witness than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And He sending Me, the Father Himself, has borne witness of Me. Neither have you heard His voice at any time nor seen His shape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you do not have His Word abiding in you, for you do not believe Him whom He has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life. And they are the ones witnessing of Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>and you will not come to Me that you might have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive honor from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me. If another shall come in [his] own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, [you who] receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that [comes] from God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is [one] who accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe My words?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, [the Sea] of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His miracles which He did on the sick ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into a mountain and sat there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>And the Passover was near, a feast of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up [His] eyes and saw a great crowd come to Him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy loaves so that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>And He said this to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered Him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not enough for them, that every one may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are these among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing is lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered and filled twelve handbaskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then seeing the miracle that Jesus did, those men said, This is truly the Prophet, the [One] coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they would come and take Him by force, that they might make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain alone [by] Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>And when evening had come, the disciples went down to the sea</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea rose up because of a great wind that blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Then having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the ship. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But He said to them, I AM! Do not be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they willingly received Him into the boat. And immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The following day, the crowd standing on the other side of the sea had seen that there was no other little boat there except that one into which His disciples had entered, and when they saw that Jesus did not go with His disciples into the little boat, but [that] His disciples had gone away alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(however, other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the loaves, the Lord having given thanks),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And when they had found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not labor [for] the food that perishes, but for that food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give you. For God the Father sealed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on [Him] whom He has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>Therefore they said to Him, What sign do you show then, so that we may see and believe you? What do you work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you that bread from Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes on Me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the [one] who comes to Me I will in no way cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I came down from Heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes on Him should have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the bread which came down from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How now does this One say, I have come down from Heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to Me unless the Father who has sent Me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Therefore everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God, He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes on Me has everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the Bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the Bread which comes down from Heaven, so that a man may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he shall live forever. And truly the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this man give us [his] flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus says to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who partakes of My flesh and drinks My blood dwells in Me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father has sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who partakes of Me, even he shall live by Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the Bread which came down from Heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he who partakes of this Bread shall live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>He said these things in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Then when they had heard, many of His disciples said, This is a hard saying, who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But knowing in Himself that His disciples murmured about it, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>Then [what] if you should see the Son of man going up where He was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from [the] beginning who they were who did not believe, and who is the one] betraying Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And He said, Because of this I said to you that no one can come to Me unless it was given to him from My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this [time] many of His disciples went back into the things behind, and walked no more with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have [the] words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? And one [of] you is a devil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>But he spoke [of] Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon; for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the Twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>And the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>Therefore His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret, while he himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For His brothers did not believe in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to this feast; I am not yet going up to this feast; for My time is not yet fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Then the Jews sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the crowd concerning Him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one spoke openly of Him, because of the fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Now about the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, not being taught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone desires to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? And [yet] not one of you keeps the law! Why do you seek to kill Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The crowd answered and said, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Because of this Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath day so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry at Me because I have made a man entirely sound on the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of those from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>But lo, he speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is the Christ indeed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>However, we know this one, from where he is; but when Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Then Jesus cried in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I come. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they sought to seize Him, but no one laid [a] hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>And many of the crowd believed on Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more miracles than these which this One has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard that the crowd murmured such things concerning Him. And the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to seize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and [then] I go to Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me]. And where I am, you cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Then the Jews said among themselves, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What saying is this that He said, You shall seek Me and shall not find [Me], and where I am, you cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>(But He spoke this about the Spirit, which they who believed on Him should receive; for [the] Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Then when they heard the Word, many of the people said, Truly this is the Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, Does the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has the Scripture not said that Christ comes from the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why have you not brought him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, Never did any man speak as does this Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>Then the Pharisees answered them, Also, have you not been deceived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Is it not true that] not any of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed into him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this crowd, not knowing the law, is cursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus said to them, (he who came to Jesus [by] night, being one of them),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>Does our law judge the Man before it hears Him and knows what He does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search the scriptures and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>And they each went to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him. And He sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery. And standing her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this, tempting Him so that they might have [reason] to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote on the ground with [His] finger, not appearing [to hear].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>But as they continued to ask Him, He lifted Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And again bending down, He wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>And hearing, and being convicted by conscience, they went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>And bending back up, and seeing no one but the woman, Jesus said to her, Woman, where are the ones who accused you? Did not one give judgment against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>Therefore the Pharisees said to Him, You bear record concerning yourself; your witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record concerning Myself, My witness is true. For I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge after the flesh, I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and [the] Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am one who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus said to them, You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as He taught in the temple. And no man laid hands upon Him, for His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then Jesus said again to them, I go away, and you shall seek Me and shall die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? Because he says, Where I go you cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>Therefore I said to you that you shall die in your sins, for if you do not believe that I AM, you shall die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even [the same] which I also say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say and to judge of you, but He who sent Me is true, and I speak to the world those things what I heard of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that He spoke to them [of] the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Then Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things which please Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>[As] He spoke these words, many believed upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Then Jesus said to the Jews who believed on Him, If you continue in My Word, you are My disciples indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to anyone. How do you say, You will be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever practices sin is the slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>And the slave does not abide in the house forever, [but] the Son abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>Therefore if the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me because My Word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you, then, do what you have seen with your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus answered them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I have heard beside God; this Abraham did not do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do the deeds of your father. Then they said to Him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, [even] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your father, you would love Me, for I went forth and came from God; for I did not come of Myself, but He sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not know My speech? Because you cannot hear My word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from [the] beginning, and did not abide in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>And because I tell [you] the truth, you do not believe Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God hears God's words. Therefore you do not hear [them] because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>And I do not seek My own glory, but there is One who seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keeps My Word, he shall never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets are dead, and you say, If a man keeps my Word, he shall never taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I should say I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I know Him and I keep His Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and He saw and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I AM!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they took up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus hid Himself and went forth out of the temple, going through [the] midst of them, and passed on by.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>And passing by, He saw a man who was blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Master, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither has this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>I must work the works of Him who sent Me, while it is day. Night comes when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am [the] Light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>And when He had spoken these things, He spat on the ground and made clay from the spittle. And He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which translated is Sent). Therefore he went and washed and came seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Then the neighbors and those who had seen him before, that he was blind, said, Is this not he who was sitting and begging?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, This is he. Others [said], He is like him. He said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>Then they said to him, How were your eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And going and washing, I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Then they said to him, Where is he? He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought him who once was blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>And it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a man, a sinner, do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>They said to the blind man again, What do you say about him, for he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him having received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>But by what means he now sees, we do not know. Or who has opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age, ask him. He will speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents spoke these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed that He was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore his parents said, He is of age, ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>Then a second time they called the man who was blind and said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear [it] again? Do you also desire to be His disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>Then they reviled him and said, You are his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know from where this man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know from where He is, and He has opened my eyes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this One were not of God, He could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>And he answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and it is He who is speaking with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, I have come into this world for judgment, that they who do not see might see, and that they who see might be made blind.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(And it was [that] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>Then his sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard, He said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God might be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>Therefore, when He had heard that he was sick, then indeed He remained two days in the place where He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after that He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews lately have sought to stone You, and do You go there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because there is no light in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He said these things; and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps. But I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he will get well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He had spoken of taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas (he being called Twin) said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Then when Jesus came, He found him already being held in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>And Bethany was near Jerusalem, fifteen stadia away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she met Him. But Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know that even now, whatever You will ask of God, God will give You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life! He who believes in Me, though he die, yet he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who has come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And saying these things, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher has come and calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard, she arose quickly and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw that Mary rose up hastily and went out, [they] followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then when Mary had come where Jesus was, seeing Him, Mary fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Then when He saw her weeping, and also the Jews who came with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And [He] said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then the Jews said, Behold how He loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>And some of them said, Was not this Man who opened the eyes of the blind able also to cause that even this one should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, groaning in Himself again, came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who died, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks. For it is [the] fourth [day].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus answered her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [His] eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I know that You hear Me always, but because of the people who stand by I said [it], so that they may believe that You have sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And saying these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, Here! Outside!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with sheets, and his face was bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Untie him and let [him] go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and Pharisees gathered a sanhedrin, and said, What can we do? For this man does many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him alone this way, all will believe on him. And the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>And one of them, Caiaphas, being the high priest of that year, said to them, You do not know anything at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And he did not speak this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Then from that day they took counsel together that they might kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Therefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but He went away from there to a country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and continued there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Jews' Passover was near. And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple, What does it seem to you, that He will not at all come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that if anyone knew where He was, he should make [it] known so that they might seize Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was (who had died, whom He raised from [the] dead).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>Then they made a supper there for Him. And Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then said one of His disciples (Judas Iscariot, Simon's [son], who was to betray Him)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this ointment not sold [for] three hundred denarii and given to [the] poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried the things put [in].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has kept this for the day of My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you have the poor with you always; but you do not always have Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come for Jesus' sake only, but also that they might see Lazarus, whom He had raised from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd who had come to the Feast</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him. And [they] cried, Hosanna! Blessed [is] the King of Israel who comes in [the] name of [the] Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes sitting on the foal of an ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>But His disciples did not know these things at the first. But when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and [that] they had done these things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Then the crowd witnessed, those who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>Because of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>Then the Pharisees said among themselves, Do you see how you gain nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>Then these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew. And again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life shall lose it. And he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant shall be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>And My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this cause I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Your name! Then there came a voice from the heaven [saying], I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Then the crowd who stood by and heard said that it thundered. Others said, An angel spoke to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is [the] judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But He said this, signifying what kind [of] death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ lives forever. How do you say, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness come upon you. For he who walks in darkness does not know where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the Light, believe in the Light so that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But [though] He had done so many miracles before them, yet they did not believe on Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>so that the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with [their] eyes nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe on Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes on Me does not believe on Me but on Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come [as] a Light into the world, so that whoever believes on Me should not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any one hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him, for I do not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken of Myself, but [the] Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that His command is life everlasting. Therefore whatever I speak, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>And before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come when He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved [His] own in the world, He loved them to [the] end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And when supper had ended, the Devil now having put into the heart of Judas Iscariot [the son] of Simon to betray Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into [His] hands, and that He had come from God and went to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>He rose up from supper and laid aside [His] garments. And He took a towel and girded Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>After that He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe [them] with the towel with which He was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, You do not know what I do now, but you shall know hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to Him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash [his] feet, but is clean every whit. And you are clean, but not all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For He knew who would betray Him. Therefore He said, You are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So after He had washed their feet and had taken His garments and had reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>And lying on Jesus' breast, he said to him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give the morsel when I have dipped [it]. And dipping the morsel, He gave [it] to Judas Iscariot, the [son] of Simon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and put [it] on His head. And they put a purple robe on Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck Him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Then Pilate went out again and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And [Pilate] said to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>Then when the chief priests and under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify [Him]! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Then when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And [he] went again into the praetorium and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, You could have no authority against Me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this [time], Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Then when Pilate heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement (but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was [the] preparation of the Passover, and about [the] sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away with [him]! Away with [him]! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he delivered Him up to them that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led [Him] away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called, [The Place] of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, the king of the Jews, but that he said, I am king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then when they had crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, one part to each soldier; and also [His] tunic. And the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>Therefore they said among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to find whose it shall be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among them, and  for] my garment they cast lots). Therefore the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And His mother stood by the cross of Jesus, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Then when Jesus saw [His] mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her into [his] own [home].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Then a vessel full of vinegar was set. And they filled a sponge with sour wine and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Then when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, It is finished! And He bowed [His] head and gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Then the Jews, because it was Preparation, begged Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away, so that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath. For that sabbath was a high day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced His side [with] a lance, and instantly there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who saw bore record, and his record is true. And he knows that he speaks true, so that you might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of Him shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, They shall look upon [Him] whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews) begged of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus also came, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it with linens with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>And in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one yet had been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first of the sabbaths Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, darkness still being [on it], and [she] saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Therefore Peter and that other disciple went forth and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>So they both ran together. And the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping down he saw the linens lying, yet he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb. And he saw the linens lying [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>And the grave-cloth that was on His head [was] not lying with the linens, but was wrapped up in one place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Therefore, then, that other disciple also went in, the [one] who came first to the tomb. And he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not know the Scripture that He must rise again from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside of the tomb, weeping. And as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And [she] saw two angels in white sitting there, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And when she had said this, she turned backward and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away from here, tell me where you have laid Him and I will take Him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned herself and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and Your Father, and [to] My God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when He had said this, He showed them [His] hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As [My] Father has sent Me, even so I send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when He had said this, He breathed on [them] and said to them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Of whomever sins you remit, they are remitted to them. Of whomever [sins] you retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I shall see the print of the nails in His hands, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days the disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then He said to Thomas, Reach your finger here and behold My hands; and reach your hand here and thrust [it] into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me you have believed. Blessed [are] they who have not seen and have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life in His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed [Himself] this way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, and Thomas called [the] Twin, and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We will go with you also. They went out and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when the morning had come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find. Therefore they cast, and now they no longer had [the] strength to draw, from the multitude of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loves said to Peter, It is the Lord! Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on [his] coat (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits), dragging the net of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then when they went up on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish lying on [it], and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>And Jesus said to them, Bring from the fish which you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty-three. And [though] there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And none of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This [is] now the three times Jesus was revealed to His disciples, [He] being risen from [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him the second time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him a third [time], Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you grow old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry [you] where [you] do not wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following (the one who also leaned on His breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he who betrays You?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you? You follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die, but, If I desire that he remain until I come, what [is that] to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which, if they should be written singly, I suppose the world itself [could] not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</verse>
