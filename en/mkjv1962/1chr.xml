        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.7'>And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.8'>But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to My name because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.9'>Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. And I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.17'>And David commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.22.18'>Is not the LORD your God with you? And has He not given you rest on every side? For He has given the people of the land into my hand. And the land is humbled before the LORD and before His people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.24.5'>So they divided them by lot, one sort with another. For the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</verse>
