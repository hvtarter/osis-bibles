      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, [the] Son of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>as it is written in the Prophets, Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of [the] Lord, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the land of Judea, and those of Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather girdle about his loin. And he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he proclaimed, saying, There is One coming after me who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to loosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed have baptized you in water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice from Heaven, [saying], You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. And He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God draws near. Repent, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And walking along beside the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, Come after Me and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when He going farther from there a little, He saw James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately He called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum. And immediately on the sabbath day He entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at His doctrine. For He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And in their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, What [is] to us and to You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know You, who You are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him, and crying with a loud voice, he came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>They all were amazed, so as to question among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine [is] this? For He even commands the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately His fame went out into all the Galilean neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately after they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and at once they told Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up. And instantly the fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And at evening, when the sun set, they brought all those who were diseased to Him, and those who had been demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city had gathered at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And He healed many who were sick of different diseases, and cast out many demons. And He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And rising up quite early in [the] night, He went out and went away into a deserted place, and [He] was praying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon, and those with him, searched for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And finding Him, they said to Him, All are seeking You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And He said to them, Let us go into the next towns so that I may proclaim there also. For that reason I came forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And He proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to Him, begging Him and kneeling down to Him, and saying to Him, If You will, You can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out [His] hand and touched him, and said to him, I will; be clean!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And He having spoken, the leprosy instantly departed from him and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And He strictly charged him and immediately sent him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and He said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone. But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer those things which Moses commanded for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But going out, he began to proclaim [it] very much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again He entered into Capernaum after [some] days. And it was heard that He was in [a] house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately many were gathered, so that none any longer had room, even to the door. And He proclaimed the Word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Then they came to Him, bringing one [who was] paralyzed, who was carried by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>When they could not come near to Him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where He was. And digging through, they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But some of the scribes were sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this one speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And instantly knowing in His spirit that they reasoned so within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Your] sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your cot and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But so that you may know that the Son of man has authority upon earth to forgive sins, He said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to you, Arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose and took up his cot and went out before all. So that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw [it] this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And He went out again by the seaside. And all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as He passed on, He saw Levi [the son] of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office. And [He] said to him, Follow Me. And he arose and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it happened as Jesus reclined in his house, many tax-collectors and sinners also reclined with Jesus and His disciples. For there were many, and they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eat with tax-collectors and sinners, [they] said to His disciples, How [is it] that He eats and drinks with tax-collectors and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard, He said to them, They who are strong have no need of a physician, but the ones who have illness. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>The disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>And no one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, else [it] takes away from its fullness, the new [from] the old, and a worse tear occurs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No one puts new wine into old wineskins, else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine spills, and the wineskins will be ruined. The new wine must be put into new wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it happened that He went through the grainfields on the sabbath day. And as they walked His disciples began to pluck the heads [of grain].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And He said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he, and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God in [the days of] Abiathar the high priest and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And He said to them, The sabbath came into being for man's sake, and not man for the sabbath's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of man is also Lord of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And He again entered into the synagogue. And a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched Him to see if He would heal him on the sabbath day, so that they might accuse Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise! Come into the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And He said to them, [Is it] lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? To save life, or to kill? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around on them with anger, being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand! And he stretched [it] out. And his hand was restored whole, like the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples. And a great crowd from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and [from] beyond Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a great throng came to him, having heard how much He was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And He spoke to His disciples, so that a small boat should stay near to Him, because of the crowd, lest they should press on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For He had healed many, so that they pressed on Him in order to touch Him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, [they] fell down before Him and cried, saying, You are the Son of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And He strictly charged them that they should not make Him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And He went up into a mountain and called near those whom He would. And they came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And He put on Simon [the] name Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>And He put on James [the son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, [the] names Boanerges, which is, the Sons of Thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And [He appointed] Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James [the son] of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And they went into a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And again a crowd came together, so that they could not even eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And hearing, those with Him went out to take hold [of] Him; for they said, He is insane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And He called them and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan rises up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter into a strong one's house and plunder his goods, except he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never shall have forgiveness, but is liable to eternal condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then His brothers and His mother came. And standing outside, [they] sent to Him, calling Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And the crowd sat about Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking for You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And He looked around on those who sat about Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God, the same is My brother and My sister and My mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And He began again to teach by the seaside. And there was a great crowd gathered to Him, so that He entered into a boat and sat in the sea. And the whole crowd was on the land by the seaside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And He taught them many things by a parable. And He said to them in His teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And as he sowed, it happened that indeed some fell by the wayside, and the fowls of the air came and ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And another fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth. And it sprang up at once, due to not having deepness of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>And when [the] sun rose, it was scorched. And because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And another fell on good ground and yielded fruit, going up and increasing. And one bore thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when He was alone, they who were about Him, with the Twelve, asked Him concerning the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And He said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside, all [these] things are [given] in parables</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how then will you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are those by the wayside, where the Word is sown. And when they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are those likewise being sown on stony places; who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>But they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the Word's sake, they are immediately offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are those being sown among thorns; such as hear the Word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of this world, and the deceit of riches, and the lust about other things entering in, choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are those sown on good ground, who hear the Word and welcome [it], and bear fruit, one thirty, one sixty, and one a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And He said to them, Does a lamp come to be put under a grain-measure, or under a bed? and not to be set on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed; nor became covered, but that it might come to the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With that measure which you measure, it shall be measured to you. And to you who hear, more shall be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he who has, [more] shall be given to him; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth brings out fruit of itself, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit has been brought out, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And He said, to what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what parable shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>[It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But when it has been sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches, so as to enable the birds of the air to roost under its shade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them, as they were able to hear [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But he did not speak to them without a parable. And when [they were] alone, He explained all things to His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And evening having come, He said to them on that day, Let us pass over to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And when they had sent away the crowd, they took Him with them as He was in the boat. And there were also other little boats with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there arose a windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And He was in the stern of the boat, asleep on a headrest. And they awakened Him and said to Him, Master, do You not care that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And He awakened and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How [is it] that you have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly and said to one another, What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came over to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when He had come out of the boat, immediately a man with unclean spirits met Him out of the tombs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had [his] dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, no, not with chains</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nor could anyone subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and cried with a loud voice, and said, What [is] to me and to You, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God not to torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And He asked him, What [is] your name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he begged Him very much that He would not send them outside the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>And a great herd of pigs was feeding near the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And immediately Jesus allowed them. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the pigs. And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And the ones who fed the pigs fled and told [it] in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus and saw him who had been demon-possessed, and had the legion, sitting and clothed and right-minded, the one who had the legion. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen told them how it happened to the one who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg Him to leave their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when He had come into the boat, the [former] demoniac begged Him that he might be with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>However Jesus did not allow him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and has had mercy on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And Jesus having crossed again by boat to the other side, a large crowd collected on Him. And He was near the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And, behold, one of the synagogue rulers came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, [he] fell at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>And he begged Him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come, lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And [Jesus] went with him. And many people followed Him and thronged Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been bettered any, but rather came to worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard about Jesus, she came in the press behind and touched His garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I may but touch only His clothes, I will be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And instantly the fountain of her blood dried up. And she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And knowing instantly within Himself that power had gone out of Him, Jesus turned Himself around in the press and said, Who touched My clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd pressing on You, and do You say, Who touched Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done in her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be whole from your plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While He still spoke, they came from the synagogue ruler's house, saying, Your daughter is dead; why do you still trouble the Teacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But hearing the word spoken, Jesus said to the synagogue ruler, Do not be afraid, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And He allowed no one to follow Him, except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And He came to the synagogue ruler's and saw a tumult, and weeping and much wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And going in He said to them, Why do you make a tumult and weep? The girl is not dead, but sleeps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed at Him. But when He had put [them] all out, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and went in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And He took the child's hand and said to her, Talitha koumi; (which interpreted is, Little girl, I say to you, arise!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And instantly the little girl arose and walked (for she was twelve years [old] ). And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And He strictly warned them that no one should know this. And He said to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And He went out from there and came into His native-place. And His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the sabbath day had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing [Him], were astonished, saying, Where does this one get these things? And what wisdom [is] this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are done by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his native-place, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick ones, He healed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around the villages, in [a] circuit, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And He called the Twelve and began to send them out by two and two. And He gave them authority over unclean spirits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>and commanded them that they take nothing in [the] way, except only a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in the belt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but tying on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from [that place].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went out and proclaimed that [men] should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many demons, and anointed many who were sick with oil, and healed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And king Herod heard [of Him] (for His name had become well-known,) and he said that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead, and therefore mighty works operate in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said [that it was] Elijah. And others said that he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But hearing Herod said, It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John and had bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For he had married her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>and John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>And Herodias held it against him, and desired to kill him, but she could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herod feared John, knowing that [he was] a just and holy man. And he kept him safe. And when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And a convenient day came, when Herod made a supper to great men on his birthday, and to the chiliarchs, and to the first ones of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod, and those who reclined with [him], the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you desire from me, and I will give [it] to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he swore to her, Whatever you shall ask from me, I will give [it] to you, to the half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I desire that you give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And becoming deeply grieved, the king, because of his oath, and those reclining together, he did not wish to reject her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles gathered themselves to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And He said to them, Come aside into a deserted place and rest a little. For there were many coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they departed by boat into a deserted place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And the crowds saw them leaving, and many knew Him. And [they] ran together on foot there, out of the cities. And they went before them and came together to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And going out Jesus saw a large crowd. And He was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And [it] now becoming a late hour, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place and [it is] now a late hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away so that they may go to the surrounding fields and villages and buy loaves for themselves. For they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>He answered and said to them, You give them [food] to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of loaves and give them to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And He commanded them all to recline, group [by] group, on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they reclined group [by] group, by hundred and by fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to His disciples to set before them. And He divided the two fish to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve hand baskets full [of] fragments, also from the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those eating the loaves were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately He constrained His disciples to get into the boat and to go before to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent away the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And taking leave [of] them, He went away to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening had come, the boat was in [the] middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And He saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came toward them walking on the sea, and would have passed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed that it was a phantom, and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He talked with them, and said, Be of good cheer. I AM! Do not be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And He went up into the boat to them. And the wind was cut off. And they were very much amazed within themselves beyond measure, and marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they did not understand [the miracle] of the loaves, for their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And crossing over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they had come out of the boat, at once knowing Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>they ran all around that neighborhood, and began to carry on cots those who were sick, wherever they heard He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever He entered, into villages or cities or country, they laid the sick in the streets and begged Him if only they might touch but the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made whole.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>And the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>And when they saw some of His disciples eating loaves with unclean hands, that is with unwashed hands, they found fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they immerse [their] hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And coming from the market, they do not eat without immersing, and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dippings of cups and pots, and of copper vessels, and of tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat loaves with unwashed hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>But He answered and said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors Me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>However, they worship Me in vain, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the dippings of pots and cups. And many other such things you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And He said to them, Do you do well to set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your own tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother. And, Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban! (that is, A gift [to God], whatever you may profit by me)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>and you no longer allow him to do anything toward [his] father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have delivered. And you do many such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And calling near all the crowd, He said to them, Listen to Me, every one of you, and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from outside a man which entering into him can defile [him]. But the things which come out of him, those are the ones that defile the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when He had entered into the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>And He said to them, Are you also without understanding? Do you not perceive that whatever enters into the man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the waste-bowl, purifying all food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And He said, That which comes out of the man is what defiles the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things pass out from inside and defile the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>And He arose from there and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered into a house and desired no one to know [it]. But He could not be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>The woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race. And she begged Him that He would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be filled. For it is not right to take the children's loaves and to throw [it] to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And He said to her, For this saying go, the demon has gone out of your daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter lay on the couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, He came to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the borders of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they brought a deaf one to Him, hardly speaking. And they begged Him to put [His] hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And He took him aside from the crowd and put His fingers into his ears. And He spat and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And looking up to Heaven, He sighed and said to him, Ephphatha! (that is, Be opened!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And instantly his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And He commanded them, that they should tell no one. But the more He commanded them, so much the more they proclaimed [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, the crowd being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on the crowd because they have now been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint in the way. For many of them come from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And His disciples answered Him, From where can a man satisfy these [with] loaves here in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And He commanded the people to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, and He broke and gave to His disciples to set before them. And they set [them before] the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few fish. And He blessed and commanded them to also serve these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So they ate and were filled. And [they] took up over and above seven lunch baskets [of] fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>And they who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately He entered into a boat with His disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking a sign from Heaven from Him, tempting Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And He sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, [There shall no] sign be given to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And He left them. And entering into the boat again, He departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And [the disciples] had forgotten to take loaves, and they did not have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And He charged them, saying, Take heed! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>And after that He put [His] hands again on his eyes and made him look up. And he was restored and saw all clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus and His disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And He began to speak to them by parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a fence about [it], and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and [he] let it out to vinedressers, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, so that he might receive from the vinedressers the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And taking [him], they beat him and sent [him] away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent to them another servant. And stoning that one, they struck [him] in the head, and sent [him] away, insulting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And again he sent another. And they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore, still having one son, his own beloved, he also sent him to them last of all, saying, They will respect my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And they took him and killed [him] and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>And have you not read this scripture  The] Stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of [the] corner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to seize him, but feared the crowd. For they knew that He spoke the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>And they sent certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him, to catch Him in [His] words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And coming, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that you are true and you care about no one. For you do not look to [the] face of men, but teach the way of God [in] truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought [it]. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? And they said to Him, Caesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And answering Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then the Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked Him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If a man's brother die and leaves [his] wife, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>And there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died; neither did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven had her, and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>And answering Jesus said to them, Do you not err because of this, not knowing Scriptures, nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they shall rise from [the] dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are as the angels in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And as regards the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses how God spoke to him in the Bush, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of [the] dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you greatly err.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And coming up one of the scribes heard them reasoning, knowing that He had answered them well, he asked Him, Which is [the] first commandment of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel, [the] Lord our God is one Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and you shall love [the] Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. This [is] the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And [the] second [is] like this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to Him, Right, Teacher, according to truth You have spoken, that God is one, and there is no other besides Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And seeing that he had answered intelligently, Jesus said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And answering, teaching in the temple, Jesus said, How do the scribes say that Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The LORD said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David therefore himself calls Him Lord, and why [then] is He his son? And the great crowd heard Him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who love to walk about in robes, and [love] greetings in the markets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour widows' houses, and as a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus watched how the people threw copper coins into the treasury. And many rich ones threw in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And a certain poor widow came, and she threw in two lepta, which is a kodrantes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And He called His disciples and said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast [in] more than all those who have cast into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For all cast in from their abundance. But she, out of her poverty, has cast [in] all that she had, all her livelihood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Master, see! What stones and what buildings!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>And [as] He sat on the Mount of Olives, across from the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And Jesus answering them began to say, Beware that no one deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>For many shall come in My name, saying, I AM, and shall deceive many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>And when you shall hear [of] wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. For it must happen, but the end [shall] not [be] yet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But take heed to yourselves. For they shall deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in the synagogues you shall be beaten. And you shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>But whenever they lead [you] away and deliver [you] up, take no thought beforehand what you should speak or think. But speak whatever shall be given to you in that hour. For it is not you who speaks, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>And a brother will betray a brother to death, and a father his son. And children will rise up against [their] parents and will cause them to be put to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>But when you see the abomination of desolation, that spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>And he denied it again. And a little after, those who stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are [one] of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and to swear, [saying], I do not know this man of whom you speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before a cock crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking on [it], he wept.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led [Him] away and delivered [Him] to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked Him, Are you the king of the Jews? And answering He said to him, You say [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused Him [of] many things, but He answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>And at [that] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with the insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the crowd, crying aloud, began to beg [him to do] as he had always done to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answered and said again to them, What then do you desire that I should do [to him] whom you call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Then Pilate said to them, Why? What evil has he done? And they much more cried out, Crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And deciding to do the easiest [to] the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and having scourged [Him], delivered up Jesus to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led Him away inside the court, which is [the] praetorium. And they called together all the cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed Him with purple and plaited a crown of thorns and put it around His [head].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck Him on the head with a reed, and spat on Him, and placing the knees, [they] bowed to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him and put His own clothes on Him and led Him out to crucify Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they made one who was passing by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought Him to Golgotha Place (which translated is, Place of a Skull).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink. But He did not take [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots on them, as, to what [each] should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was [the] third hour, and they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of His accusation was written over [Him], THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with Him they crucified two thieves, the one off [the] right, and one off [the] left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, And he was numbered with [the] lawless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You [razing] the temple and building [it] in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself and come down from the cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>And also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes, said to one another, He saved others but he cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let Christ the King of Israel now come down from the cross, so that we may see and believe. And they who were crucified with Him insulted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And [it] being [the] sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? (which being translated is, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And hearing, some of those standing by said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put [it] on a reed and gave [it] to him to drink. [But they said], Let alone, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And letting out a loud voice, Jesus expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion, who stood across from him, saw that He cried out so, [and] expired, he said, Truly this man was Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And also women were watching from a distance, among whom also was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>(who also, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him), and many [other] women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And it, becoming evening already, since it was [the] Preparation, that is, [the] day before sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counsellor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if He were already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether He had died already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he knew [it] from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he bought a linen cloth, and took Him down, and wrapped [Him] in the linen, and laid Him in a tomb which was cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses saw where He was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, [the mother] of James and Salome, had bought sweet spices so that they might come and anoint Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning, the first [day] of the week, they came upon the tomb, the sun having risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back, for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed [in] a long white garment. And they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he said to them, Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen, He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go tell His disciples and Peter that He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, as He said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out quickly and fled from the tomb. For they trembled and were amazed. Neither did they say anything to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>And when [Jesus] had risen early the first [day] of the Sabbath, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went [and] told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those hearing that He lives, and was seen by her, they did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that He appeared in another form to two of them, walking [and] going into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told [it] to the rest. Neither did they believe those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward He appeared to the Eleven as they reclined. And [He] reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And He said to them, Go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And miraculous] signs will follow to those believing these things: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on [the] sick, and they will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>Then indeed, after speaking to them, the Lord was taken up into Heaven, and sat on [the] right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And going out, they proclaimed everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word by miraculous] signs following. Amen.</verse>
