  <div type='book' osisID='1Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the] Thessalonians, in God [the] Father and in [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God for you always, making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, beloved brothers, your election of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in [the] Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, as you know what kind [of men] we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, welcoming the word in much affliction, with joy of [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that you were examples to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you the Word of the Lord sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves witness what kind of entrance we had to you, even how you turned from idols to God in order to serve the] living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for His Son from Heaven (whom He raised from [the] dead), Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For, my brothers, you yourselves know our coming in to you, that it was not in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But also suffering before, being insulted in Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much agony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation [to you was] not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted [with] the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor with pretense of covetousness; God [is] witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, being able to be [so] with heaviness, as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse warmly cherishes her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So affectionately longing for you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because you have become beloved to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For, brothers, you remember our labor and toil. [For] laboring night and day in order not to put a burden on any one of you, we preached the gospel of God to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You and God [are] witnesses how holily and justly and blamelessly we were to you who believe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>even as you know how we exhorted and comforted and testified to each one of you, as a father to his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to His kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And for this cause we thank God without ceasing, that when you received [the] Word of hearing, of God, you welcomed [it as] the Word of God, not as a word of men, but [as] it is, truly [the] Word of God, which also effectually works in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also have suffered these things by [your] own countrymen, even as they also by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, also driving us out and they do not please God and [being] contrary to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always; but the wrath has come upon them to [the] uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But, my brothers, when we were taken away from you for an hour's time (in presence, not in heart), more abundantly we were eager with much desire to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we desired to come to you, truly I, Paul, both once and twice; but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what [is] our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] you not even [to be] in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could no longer endure, we were pleased to be left at Athens alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And we sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>so that no one should be drawn aside by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we were going to suffer affliction, as it also happened, even you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause, when I could no longer endure, I also sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you and our labor may have been in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timothy came from you to us and brought us good news [of] your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us (as we also you),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>then, my brothers, we were comforted over you, through your faith, even in all our affliction and needs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>for now we live, if you stand fast in [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy [with] which we rejoice for your sakes before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly for [me] to see your face and to perfect the things lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>And may God Himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all, even as we also toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>in order to establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>For the rest, then, my brothers, we beseech you and exhort [you] in [the] Lord Jesus, that, as you have received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more [and more].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For we know what commands we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, your sanctification, for you to abstain from fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>each one of you to know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>(not in the passion of lust, even as the nations who do not know God),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>not to go beyond and defraud his brother in this matter (because the Lord [is the] avenger concerning all these, as we also have forewarned you and testified).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who despises does not despise man, but God, who also has given us His Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But regarding brotherly love, you do not need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we beseech you, brothers, that you abound more [and more] ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that you try earnestly to be quiet and to do [your] own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>so that you may walk becomingly toward those outside, and that you may lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you be not grieved, even as others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him all those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For we say this to you by the Word of [the] Lord, that we who are alive [and] remain until the coming of the Lord shall not go before those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the] clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. And so we shall ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know accurately that the day of [the] Lord comes like a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they shall say, Peace and safety! Then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail upon a woman with child. And they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the Day should overtake you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all the sons of light and the sons of the day. We are not of the night, or of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep as the rest [do], but let us watch and be calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those sleeping sleep in the night, and those being drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be calm, having put on [the] breastplate of faith and love and [the] hope of salvation [for] a helmet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, so that whether we watch or sleep we should live together with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore comfort one another, and edify one another, even as you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And, brothers, we beseech you to know those who labor among you, and are over you in [the] Lord, and who admonish you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brothers, warn those who are unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See [that] none gives evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue the good, both towards one another and towards all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks, for this [is the] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things, hold fast to the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blamelessly at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful [is] He who called you, who also will do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.</verse>
