      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound to thank God always for you, my brothers, as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you abounds toward one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so much so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which you endure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>For [this is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since [it is] a righteous thing with God to repay tribulation to those who trouble you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to give rest with us to you who are troubled, at the revealing of the Lord Jesus from Heaven with the angels of His power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when He shall come to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all those who believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that Day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of the calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we beseech you, my brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>that you should not be soon shaken [in] mind or troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word or letter, as through us, as [if] the Day of Christ is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let not anyone deceive you by any means. For [that Day shall not come] unless there first comes a falling away, and the man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself forth, that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you know what holds back, for him to be revealed in his own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only he [is] now holding back until it comes out of the] midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of His mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and with all deceit of unrighteousness in those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, so that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>so that all those who do not believe the truth, but delight in unrighteousness, might be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of [the] Spirit and belief of [the] truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>to which He called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Therefore, my brothers, stand fast and hold the teachings which you have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have [free] course and be glorified, even as [it] also is] with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>And pray that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all [do] not have] the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and guard [you] from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>And we have confidence in [the] Lord regarding you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly, and not after the teaching which he received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us. For we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>neither did we eat any man's bread freely, but we worked with labor and travail night and day, so that we might not be heavy on any of you</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>(not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example to you, to imitate us).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this, that if anyone would not work, neither should he eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who walk disorderly among you, not working at all, but being busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now we command and exhort those who are such, by our Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But you, brothers, do not be weary in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And if anyone does not obey our word by this letter, mark that one and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not count [him] as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>And may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord [be] with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The greeting of Paul by my own hand which is [the] sign in every letter, so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</verse>
