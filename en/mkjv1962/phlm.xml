      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, to Philemon the beloved and fellow laborer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of your faith may operate in a full knowledge of every good thing in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation over your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, having much boldness in Christ to enjoin you to do the fitting thing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>rather through love I entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I entreat you for my child Onesimus, whom I have fathered in my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>he who was] once worthless to you, but now useful to you and to me; whom I sent back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Even receive him, that is, my own heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I resolved to retain with myself, so that for you he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your consent I was willing to do nothing, that your good should not be of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps because of this he was separated from you for an hour, that you should receive him eternally,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>not now as a slave, but beyond a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the] flesh and in the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you have me as a partner, receive him as me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you or owes [you] in anything, put that on my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, wrote it] with my own] hand; I will repay, that I do not say to you that you owe even yourself to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, that I may have your help in the Lord, refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Trusting to your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But at once prepare lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
