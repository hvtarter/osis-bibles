      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The LORD has been very angry with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>And you say to them, So says the LORD of hosts: Turn to Me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have proclaimed to them, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: Turn now from your evil ways and your evil doings. But they did not hear nor listen to Me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where [are] they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But My words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they returned and said, As the LORD of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has done with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, it [is] the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I watched by night. And behold! a Man riding on a red horse, and He stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine. And behind Him were red, sorrel and white horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then I said, O my lord, what [are] these? And the angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what these [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the Man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These [are] those whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the Angel of the LORD who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sits still and is at peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the Angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah against which You have cursed these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the LORD answered the angel who talked with me [with] good words, comfortable words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion [with] a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And with great anger I am angry at the nations at ease; [in] that I was but a little angry, and they gave help for evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore so says the LORD: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies. My house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts. And a line shall be stretched over Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry out again, saying, So says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall yet be spread abroad through good, and the LORD shall again overflow with goodness, and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, four horns!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the angel who talked with me, What [are] these? And he answered me, These [are] the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>And I said, What [are] these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold! A man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what [is] its breadth and what is its length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited, [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>And I, says the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire all around, and will be the glory in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho! Ho! Flee then from the land of the north, says the LORD. For I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Ho! O Zion, escape, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For so says the LORD of hosts: He has sent me after glory, to the nations who stripped you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a prize for their servants. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For lo, I come, and I will dwell in your midst, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the LORD shall possess Judah, His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He has risen out of His holy dwelling place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the LORD said to Satan, May the LORD rebuke you, Satan! May even the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! [Is] this not a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy clothes, and stood before the Angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy clothes from him. And to him He said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with ceremonial robes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the Angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the Angel of the LORD charged Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>So says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they [are] men of symbol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold! I will bring forth My Servant the Branch. For behold the stone that I have set before Joshua: On one stone [are] seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave its engraving, says the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, says the LORD of hosts, you shall call, each man to his neighbor, to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that talked with me came again and awakened me, as a man that is awakened out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of it gold, and a bowl on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven pipes to the seven lamps on its top;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>and two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and the other on the left of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>And I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What [are] these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Do you know what these [are]? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This [is] the Word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who [are] you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel [you shall become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings, Grace! Grace to it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>And the Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish [it]; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the LORD which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>And I answered and said to him, What [are] these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered again and said to him, What [are] the two olive clusters beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden [oil] from themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Do you not know what these [are]? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>And he said, These [are] the two sons of fresh oil who stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>And I again lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! A flying scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length [is] twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>And he said to me, This [is] the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for from now on everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be cut off according to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I will bring it forth, says the LORD of hosts; and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall devour it, and its timber and its stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel who talked with me went forth and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this [is] that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What [is] it? And he said, This [is] the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This [is] their form in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and a woman [was] sitting in the middle of the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This [is] wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah. And he cast the lead stone over its opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>And I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, two women came out. And the wind [was] in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>And I said to the angel who talked with me, Where [are] they going with the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be established and set there on its own base.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! Four chariots were coming from between two mountains. And the mountains [were] mountains of bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>Red horses [were] in the first chariot; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot horses with dappled, strong [colors].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>And I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, What [are] these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said to me, These [are] the four spirits of the heavens who go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>The black horses in it go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the dappled go forth to a south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the strong [colored ones] went forth and sought to go, so to walk to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go! Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>And he cried to me and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these who go toward the north country have caused My Spirit to rest in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the Word of the LORD came to me saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, from the exiles who have come from Babylon; and in that day you go and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>And take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And speak to him, saying, So speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the Man whose name [is] The BRANCH! And He shall spring up out of His place, and He shall build the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Even He shall build the temple of the LORD; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be for a memorial in the temple of the LORD to Helem and to Tobijah and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And the distant ones shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And [this] shall be, if you will carefully obey the voice of the LORD your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it happened in the fourth year of king Darius, the Word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>And Sherezer and Regem-melech and his men had been sent [to] the house of God, to seek the favor of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>to speak to the priests who [belong] to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, consecrating myself, as I have done these many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>And came the Word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, even those seventy years, did you truly fast to Me, [even] to Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when you ate, and when you drank, was it not for you the eaters, and for you, the drinkers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Are not [these] the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited, and prosperous, and her cities all around her, and the Negev and the Shephelah were inhabited?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the Word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>So speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Judge true judgment, and practice kindness and pity, [each] man to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And do not crush the widow or the orphan, the alien or the poor. And do not devise evil in your heart, of a man [against] his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to listen, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and made heavy their ears from hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>And they made their hearts adamant from hearing the law and the words which the LORD of hosts has sent through His Spirit, by the former prophets. And great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>And it will be, as He called, and they did not listen, so they called, and I did not listen, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>But I stormed them away on all the nations whom they did not know. And the land has been wasted behind them, from passing and from returning; for they made the land of desire a waste.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the Word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>So says the LORD of hosts: I was jealous for Zion [with] great jealousy, and I was jealous for her [with] great fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>So says the LORD: I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>So says the LORD of hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women living in the streets of Jerusalem, and [each] man [with] his staff in his hand because of their many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>So says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes, says the LORD of hosts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>So says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the east country, and from the land of the setting sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>So says the LORD of hosts: Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the house of the LORD of hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before these days there was no payment for man, nor was there payment for animal; and there was no peace to him from the adversary who went out or came in. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I [will] not [be] to the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For the seed [shall be] blessed; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it will be, as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear, but let your hands be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For so says the LORD of hosts: As I thought to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says the LORD of hosts, and I did not repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>so again I have thought in these days to do well to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These [are] the things that you shall do. [Each] man speak the truth to his neighbor. Judge [with] truth and justice for peace in your gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>And let each devise no evil in your heart [against] his neighbor; and love no false oath. For all these are things that I hate, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>So says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.20'>So says the LORD of hosts: There yet shall be peoples and inhabitants of many cities;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.21'>and the residents of one shall go to another, saying, Let us go at once to seek favor of the face of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will go also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.22'>And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to seek the favor of the face of the LORD.</verse>
