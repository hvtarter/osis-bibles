        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and uprightness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give sense to the simple, knowledge and judgment to the young man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>the wise hears and increases learning; and understanding ones gets wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb and its meaning; the words of the wise, and their acute sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of knowledge; but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>for they [shall be] an ornament of grace to your head and chains around your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners lure you, do not be willing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, we will watch secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those who go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>we shall find all precious goods; we shall fill our houses [with] plunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>cast in your lot among us, and let us have one purse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, do not walk in the way with them! Keep back your foot from their path,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lie in wait for their [own] blood; they watch secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So [are] the ways of everyone who gains unjust gain; it takes away its owners' life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries outside; she utters her voice in the streets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>she cries in the chief place of gathering, in the openings of the gates; in the city she utters her words, [saying] ,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn at my warning; behold, I will pour out my Spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I called, and you refused; I stretched out my hand, and no one paid attention;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>but you have despised all my advice, and would have none of my warning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your trouble; I will mock when your fear comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when your fear comes as a wasting away, and your ruin comes like a tempest when trouble and pain come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>instead they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They would have none of my counsel; they despised all my correction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>and they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>if you seek her as silver, and search [for] her as for hidden treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then you shall understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD gives wisdom; out of His mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>He keeps the paths of judgment, and guards the way of His saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you shall understand righteousness and judgment and honesty, every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasing to your soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>judgment shall keep you, understanding shall keep you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>to deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man who speaks wicked things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil [and] delight in the perversities of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>whose ways [are] crooked, and [are] devious in their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>[They] will deliver you from the strange woman, the stranger [who] flatters [with] her words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house bows down to death, and her paths to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>All who go in to her do not return, nor do they take hold of the paths of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>in order that you may walk in the way of good and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell [in] the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>Healing shall be to your navel and marrow to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, and all her paths [are] peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She [is] a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her; and happy [is] everyone who keeps her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD has founded the earth by wisdom; by understanding He has founded the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By His knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it beside you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Do not plan evil against your neighbor, since he dwells trustingly by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Do not envy the cruel man, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the crooked man [is] hateful to the LORD, but His secret [is] with the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of the LORD [is] in the house of the wicked; but He blesses the home of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely He scorns the scorners; but He gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
