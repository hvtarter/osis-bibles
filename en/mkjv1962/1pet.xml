      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to [the] elect sojourners of [the] Dispersion of Pontus, of Galatia, of Cappadocia, of Asia, and of Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of [the] Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of [the] blood of Jesus Christ. May grace and peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us again to a living hope through [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ from [the] dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in Heaven for you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>by [the] power of God, having been kept through faith to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>in which you greatly rejoice, yet a little [while], if need be, grieving in manifold temptations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that the trial of your faith (being much more precious than that of gold that perishes, but being proven through fire) might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom having not seen, you love; in whom not yet seeing, but believing in Him you exult with unspeakable joy, and having been glorified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>obtaining the end of your faith, the salvation of [your] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>About which salvation the prophets sought out and searched out, prophesying concerning the grace for you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ made clear within them, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To them it was revealed that not to themselves, but to us, they ministered the things which are now reported to you by those who have preached the gospel to you in [the] Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore girding up the loins of your mind, being sober, perfectly hope for the grace being brought to you at [the] revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but according to the Holy One who has called you, you also become holy in all conduct,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, Be holy, for I am holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you call on [the] Father, who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, pass the time of your [earthly] residence in fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from [your] fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with [the] precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>indeed having been foreknown before [the] foundation of [the] world, but revealed in [the] last times for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>those believing in God through Him, He who raised Him up from [the] dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Purifying your souls in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, love one another fervently out of a pure heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living word of God, and abiding forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For all flesh [is] as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the Word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the Word preached as gospel to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings, and all evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>desire the sincere milk of the word, as newborn babes, so that you may grow by it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if truly you have tasted that the Lord [is] gracious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>For having been drawn to Him, a living Stone, indeed rejected by men, but elect, precious with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also as living stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore also it is contained in the Scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner Stone, elect, precious, and he who believes on Him shall never be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>Therefore to you who believe [is] the honor. But to those who are disobedient, [He is the] Stone which the builders rejected; this One came to be [the] Head of the corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a Stone-of-stumbling and a Rock-of-offense to those disobeying, who stumble at the word, to which they also were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for possession, so that you might speak of the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>[you] who then were not a people, but now the people of God, those not pitied [then], but now pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Dearly beloved, I exhort [you] as [temporary] residents and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your conduct honest among the nations, in that which they speak against you as evildoers, they may glorify God in a day of [His] visitation, seeing [your] good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Then be in obedience to every ordinance of men, because of the Lord, whether to a king as supreme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors as sent by Him for vengeance [on] evildoers, but for praise [on] well-doers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For such is the will of God, doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not having freedom as a cover of evil, but as servants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, [be] subject to [your] masters with all fear, not only to those good and forbearing, but also to the perverse ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this [is] a grace, if for conscience [toward] God anyone endures grief, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory [is it] if you patiently endure [while] sinning and being buffeted? But if you suffer [while] doing good, and patiently endure, this [is] a grace from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For you were not called to this? For Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>He who did no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who when He was reviled did not revile in return. When He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave [Himself] up to Him who judges righteously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>[He] Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that dying to sins, we might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were as sheep going astray, but now you are turned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Likewise, wives, [be] in subjection to your own husbands, so that if any do not obey the word, they may also be won without the word by the conduct of the wives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>having witnessed your chaste behavior in [the] fear [of God].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Of whom let not be the adorning of garments, or outward braiding of hair and wearing of gold, or of putting on clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but [let it be] the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, the meek and quiet spirit, which is of great price in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For so once indeed the holy women hoping in God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children you became, doing good and fearing no terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Likewise, husbands, live together according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel, the female, as truly [being] co-heirs together of [the] grace of life, not cutting off your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>And finally, all [be] of one mind, having compassion on one another, loving the brothers, tenderhearted, friendly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>Never give back evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, [giving] blessing, knowing that you are called to this so that you might inherit blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For he that wants to love life and to see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn aside from evil and do good. Let him seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of [the] Lord [are] on the righteous, and His ears [open] to their prayers. But [the] Lord's face [is] against [those] who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who [is] the [one] who will harm you if you become imitators of the good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But if you also suffer for righteousness' sake, [you are] blessed. And do not fear their fear, nor be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and [be] ready always to [give] an answer to everyone who asks you a reason of the hope in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, that while they speak against you as evildoers they may be shamed, those falsely accusing your good behavior in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For [it is] better, if the will of God wills [it], to suffer [for] well-doing than [for] evil-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, indeed being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>to disobeying ones, when once the long-suffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared (in which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>which figure now also saves us, baptism; not a putting away of [the] filth of [the] flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at [the] right [hand] of God, having gone into Heaven, where [the] angels and authorities and powers are being subjected to Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, Christ having suffered for us in [the] flesh, also you arm yourselves [with] the same thought, that he suffering in [the] flesh has been made to rest from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>in order no longer to [live] in [the] lusts of men, but in [the] will of God the remaining time in [the] flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time of life which is past is enough for us to have worked out the will of the nations, having gone on in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, parties, carousings, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In these things they are surprised, [that] you [are] not running with [them] into the same excess of riot, blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>But they shall give account to Him who is ready to judge [the] living and [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For to this [end] the gospel was preached also to [the] dead, that they might be judged according to men in [the] flesh, but live according to God in [the] Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be of sound mind, and be sensible to prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent love to yourselves, for love will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another, without grudging;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>each one as he received a gift, ministering it to yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, [let it be] as [the] words of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, so that God may be glorified in all things through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory, and the might forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as [though] a strange thing happened to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but rejoice according as you are partakers of Christ's suffering, so that when His glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reviled for [the] name of Christ, [you are] blessed, because the Spirit of God and of glory rests on you. Truly according to them, He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or a meddler in the affairs of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if [one suffers] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God because of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time [has come] for the judgment to begin from the house of God. And if [it] first [begins] from us, what [will be] the end of those disobeying the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>I exhort the elders who are among you, I being also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Feed the flock of God among you, taking the oversight, not by compulsion, but willingly; nor for base gain, but readily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>nor as lording it over those allotted [to you by God], but becoming examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, younger ones, be subject to older ones, and all being subject to one another. Put on humility. For God resists proud ones, but He gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your anxiety onto Him, for He cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sensible [and] vigilant, because your adversary [the] Devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking someone he may devour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>whom firmly resist in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions in [the] world are being completed in your brotherhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>But the God of all grace, He calling us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, [He] will perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To Him [be] the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>I wrote to you through a few [words], by Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, exhorting and testifying this to be [the] true grace of God in which you stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>The fellow-elected in Babylon greet you; also Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of holy love. Peace [be] to you, all those in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
