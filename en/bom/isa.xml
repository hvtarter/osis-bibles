        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is Godâ€™s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>We believe that a man must be called by God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul -- We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. -- Joseph Smith.</verse>
