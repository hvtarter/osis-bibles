        <verse osisID='Num.35.3'>So shall the cities be theirs, to dwell in,and their pasture lands, shall, ye for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.4'>And, the pasture lands of the cities which ye shall give unto the Levite, shall be,from the wail of the city, and outwards, a thousand cubits round about</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.5'>So ye shall measureon the outside of the citythe eastward quarter two thousand by the cubit, and the south quarter two thousand by the cubit, and the west quarter two thousand by the cubit and the north quarter two thousand by the cubit, with, the city, in the midst. This, shall be unto them the pasture lands of the cities,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.6'>And, among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give that the manslayer may flee thither,and besides them, ye shall give, forty-two cities,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.11'>then shall ye find for you, convenient cities, cities of refuge, shall they be unto you,and the manslayer, who hath slain a person, by mistake, shall flee thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.12'>So shall the cities serve you for places of refuge from the redeemer,that the manslayer may not die, until he has stood before the assembly, for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.13'>And as touching the cities which ye shall give six cities of refuge, shall there be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.14'>Three of the cities, shall ye give, on this side the Jordan, and three of the cities, shall ye give in the land of Canaan,cities of refuge, shall they be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.15'>For the sons of Israel and for the sojourner. and for the settler in your midst, shall these six cities serve, as places of refuge,that any one may flee thither who hath slain a person, by mistake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.16'>If, then, with an instrument of iron, he smote him, and he died, a manslayer, he is,a manslayer, shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.17'>Or if with a stone thrown by hand, where-by one might die, he smote him and he died, a manslayer, he is,the man-slayer, shall surely die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.18'>Or, if with hand-weapon of wood, wherewith one might die, he smote him and he died a manslayer, he is,the manslayer shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.19'>The blood-redeemer, he, shall put to death the man-slayer,when he lighteth upon him, he, shall put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.20'>Or if with hate, he shall thrust at him, or hurl at him designedly, and he have died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.21'>or if with enmity, he hath smitten him with his band and he is dead, then shall he that dealt the blow, be surely put to death. a manslayer, he isthe blood-redeemer shall put to death the man-slayer, when he lighteth upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.22'>But if suddenly, without enmity, he shall thrust him, or hurl upon him any missile, without design;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.23'>Or with any stone whereby one might die without seeing him, and it fall upon him, and he dieth; he, not being at enmity with him, nor seeking to harm him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.24'>then shall the assembly judge, between him that smote and the blood-redeemer,according to these regulations;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.26'>But if the man-slayer, go out, of the bounds of his city of refuge, whereinto he hath fled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.27'>and the blood-redeemer, find him, outside the bounds of his city of refuge, then may the blood-redeemer slay the slayer, without being guilty of blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.28'>for in his city of refuge, should he have remained, until the death of the high priest,and, after the death of the high priest, might he have returned into the land which he doth possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.29'>So shall these serve you as a regulative statute unto your generations,wheresoever ye may dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.30'>Whosoever taketh away life, at the mouth of witnesses, shall, the slayer be slain,but, one witness, shall not testify against a person, to put him to death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.32'>And ye shall accept no ransom for him that hath fled to his city of refuge, if he should return to dwell in the land before the death of the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.33'>So shall ye not pollute the land wherein ye are, for blood, doth pollute the land, and for the land, no propitiatory-covering can be made, as touching blood, that is shed therein, save with the blood of him that shed it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.34'>thou must not then make unclean the land wherein, ye, are dwelling, in the midst of which, I, have my habitation; for, I,Yahweh, am making my habitation in the midst of the sons of Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.36'>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.1'>Then came near the heads of fathers, belonging to the family of the sons of Gilead son of Machir son of Manasseh, out of the families of the sons of Joseph,and spake before Moses, and before the princes, heads of fathers belonging to the sons of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.2'>and they saidUnto my lord, did Yahweh give command, to bestow the land as an inheritance, by lot, unto the sons of Israel,my lord, therefore, was commanded by Yahweh, to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.3'>When, therefore, unto any one from among the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, they become wives their inheritance shall disappear out of the inheritance of our fathers, and be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be received,and so out of the lot of our inheritance, shall it disappear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.4'>And when the jubilee shall come to the sons of Israel, then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall be receivedand, out of the, inheritance of the tribe of our fathers, shall their inheritance disappear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.5'>Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel, at the bidding of Yahweh saying,A right thing, are, the tribe of the sons of Joseph, speaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.6'>This, is the thing which Yahweh hath commanded, as to the daughters of Zelophehad saying: Unto whomsoever it may be good in their eyes, let them become wives,save only unto the family of the tribe of their father, let them become wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.7'>So shall no inheritance belonging to the sons of Israel go round from tribe to tribe,for the sons of Israel shall, each one, cleave, unto the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.8'>And, every daughter possessing all inheritance from among the tribes of the sons of Israel, unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, shall become wife,to the intent that the sons of Israel may possess each one the inheritance of his fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.9'>and no inheritance go round from one tribe to another tribe,for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave, each one unto his own inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.10'>As Yahweh commanded Moses, so, did the daughters of Zelophehad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.11'>Thus then did Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milchah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, become wives, unto the sons of their fathers brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.12'>Unto men from among the families of the son of Manasseh son of Joseph, became they wives,and so their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.36.13'>These are the commandments and the regulations which Yahweh gave in charge, by the hand of Moses, unto the sons of Israel,in the waste plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho.</verse>
