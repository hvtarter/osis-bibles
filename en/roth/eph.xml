        <title>Let us not become vain-glorious,one another, challenging, one another, envying.</title>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through Gods will, unto the saints who are  in Ephesus  and faithful in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed, be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing, in the heavenlies, in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>According as he made choice of us, in him, before the founding of a world, that we might be holy and blameless in his presence; in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>marking us out beforehand unto sonship, through Jesus Christ, for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>Unto the praise of the glory of his favour wherewith he favoured us in the Beloved One,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>In whom we have the redemption through his blood, the remission of our offences, according to the riches of his favour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which he made to superabound towards us; in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>making known to us the sacred secret of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>For an administration of the fulness of the seasons, to reunite for himself (under one head) the all things in the Christ, the things upon the heavens, and the things upon the earth, in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In whom also we were taken as an inheritance, according to the purpose of him who energiseth all things according to the counsel of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>That we should be for the praise of his glorywe who had hoped beforehand in the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In whom, ye alsohearing the word of the truth, the glad-message of your salvation,in whom also believing,were sealed with the Spirit of the promise, the Holy   ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>Which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquisition;unto his glorious praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>For this cause, I also,having heard of the faith on your part in the Lord Jesus, and that towards all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>Cease not giving thanks in your behalf, making mention in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>That, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you a Spirit of wisdom and understanding in gaining a personal knowledge of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that ye may knowwhat is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>And what the surpassing greatness of his power unto us who believe,according to the energy of the grasp of his might</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he energised in the Christ, when he raised him from among the dead, and seated him at his right hand in the heavenlies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>Over-above all principality, authority, and power, and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And did put, all things, in subjection beneath his feet. And gave him to be head over all things unto the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>Which, indeed, is his body, the fulness of him who, the all things in all, is for himself filling up.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>you alsobeing dead by your offences and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>In which at one time ye walked, according to the age of the world, according to the prince of the authority of the air, of the spirit that now energiseth in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>Among whom also, we all, had our behaviour, at one time, in the covetings of our flesh, doing the things desired by the flesh and the mind, and were children, by nature, of angereven as the rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But, God, being rich in mercy, by reason of the great love wherewith he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>Although we were dead by our offences, gave us life together with the Christ,by favour, ye have been saved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>And raised us up together, and seated us together in the heavenlies, in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>That he might point out, in the oncoming ages, the surpassing riches of his favour in graciousness upon us, in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For, by his favour, have ye been saved, through means of faith, and this   not from you, of God, the free-gift!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>Not from works, lest anyone should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>His, in fact we arehis workmanship, created in Christ Jesus upon a footing of good works, which God prepared beforehand, that, therein, we might walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Wherefore, keep in remembrancethat, at one time, ye, the nations in flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by the so-called Circumcision in flesh, made by hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>That ye were, in that season, separate from Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and godless in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But, just now, in Christ Jesus, ye, who at one time were afar off, were made nigh in the blood of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>He, in fact, is our peacewho made both one, and, the enclosing middle-wall, took down,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>The enmity, in his fleshthe law of commandments in decreesbringing to nought,that, the two, he might create in himself, into one man of new mould, making peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>And might fully reconcile them both, in one body, through means of the cross,slaying the enmity thereby;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And, coming, he announced the glad-messageof peace, unto you, the far off, and peace, unto them that were nigh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>Because, through him, we have our introductionwe bothin one Spirit, unto the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Hence, thenno longer, are ye strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and members of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>Having been built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, there being, for chief corner stone, Jesus Christ himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>In whom, an entire building, in process of being fitly joined together, is growing into a holy shrine in   Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>In whom, ye also, are being builded together, into a habitation of God in Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>If at least ye have heard of the administration of the favour of God which hath been given unto me for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'> How that , by way of revelation, was made known unto me the sacred secret,even as I before wrote in brief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>Respecting which ye can, by reading, perceive my discernment in the sacred secret of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>Which, in other generations, had not been made known unto the sons of men, as it hath, now, been revealed by his holy apostles and prophets, in Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>That they who are of the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through means of the glad-message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>Of which I was made a minister, according to the free-gift of the favour of God which was given unto me, according to the energy of his power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>Unto methe less than least of all saints, was given this favour, unto the nations, to announce the glad-message of the untraceable riches of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>And to bring to lightwhat is the administration of the sacred secret which had been hidden away from the ages in God, who did all things create:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>In order that now, unto the principalities and the authorities in the heavenlies, might be made known, through means of the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>According to a plan of the ages which he made in the anointed Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>In whom we have our freedom of speech and introduction with assurance, through the faith of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Wherefore I request, that there be no fainting in my tribulations in your behalf, the which is your glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause, I bow my knees unto the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>From whom every fatherhood in   heavens and upon the earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>In order that he may give unto youaccording to his glorious riches, with power, to be strengthened, through his Spirit, in the inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>That the Christ may dwell, through means of your faith, in your hearts, in love, having become rooted and founded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>In order that ye may be mighty enough to grasp firmly, with all the saints,what is the breadth and length and depth and height,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>To get to know, also, the knowledge-surpassing, love of the Christ,in order that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now, unto him who is able to do, above all things, exceeding abundantly above the things which we ask or conceive,according to the power which doth energise itself within us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>Unto him, be the glory, in the assembly, and in Christ Jesusunto all the generations of the age of ages; Amen:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I exhort you, therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk in a manner worthy of the calling wherewith ye were called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>With all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, bearing one with another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>Giving diligence to keepthe oneness of the Spirit in the uniting-bond of peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>One body, and one spirit, even as ye were also called in one hope of your calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>One Lord, one faith, one immersion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>One God and Father of allwho is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>To each one of you, however, hath favour been given, according to the measure of the free-gift of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Wherefore he saithAscending on high, he took captivity captive,  and  gave gifts unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now this, He ascended; what is it,savethat he also descended into the under parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He that descended, he, it is who also ascended over-above all the heavens, that he might fill all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And, he, gavesome, indeed, to be apostles, and some, prophets, and some, evangelists, and some, shepherds and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>With a view to the fitting of the saints for the work of ministering, for an upbuilding of the body of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>Until we all advanceinto the oneness of the faith, and the personal knowledge of the Son of God, into a man of full-growth, into the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>That we may, no longer, be infantsbillow-tossed and shifted round with every wind of teaching,in the craft of men, in knavery suited to the artifice of error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>But, pursuing truthmay, in love, grow into him in all things,who is the head, Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>Out of whom all the bodyfitly framing itself together, and connecting itself, through means of every joint of supply, by way of energising in the measure of each single partsecureth the growing of the body, unto an upbuilding of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This, therefore, am I saying and protesting in the Lord:that, no longer, ye walk even as, the nations, walkin the vanity of their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>Being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of Godby reason of the ignorance that existeth within them, by reason of their hearts being turned into stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Who, indeed, having become past feeling, have delivered, themselves, up, with wantonness, unto making a trade of all impurity with greed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>Ye, however, have, not thus, learned the Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>If, at least, it is, him, ye have heard, and, in him, ye have been taughteven as truth is in Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>That ye were to strip offas regardeth the former behaviourthe old man, who corrupteth himself according to his deceitful covetings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>And were to be getting young again in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>And were to put on the man of new mould, who, after God, hath been created in his truthful righteousness and loving kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Wherefore, stripping off what is false, be speaking truth each one with his neighbour, because we are members one of another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be ye angry, and not committing sin, let not the sun be going down upon your angry mood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>Neither be giving place unto the adversary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let, the stealer, no more, steal, but rather let him be toiling,working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have   to be giving away to him that hath need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let, no putrid discourse, out of your mouth, be going forth, but if anything is goodsuited to the needful upbuilding,that it may give benefit unto them that hear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And be not grieving the Holy Spirit of God, wherewith ye have been sealed unto a day of redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>All bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and outcry, and profane speaking, let it be taken away from you, with all baseness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be ye gracious one to another, tenderly affectionate, in favour forgiving one anothereven as, God also, in Christ, hath in favour forgiven you;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Become ye, therefore, imitators of God, as children beloved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>And walk in loveeven as, the Christ also, loved you, and delivered himself up in your behalf, an offering and sacrifice unto God, for a fragrance of sweet smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But, fornication, and all impurity, or covetousness, let it not be named among youeven as becometh saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>And shamelessness and foolish talking, or jesting,which things are beneath you,but, rather, giving of thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For, this, ye know, if ye take notethat no fornicator, or impure or greedy person, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one be deceiving you with empty words; for, because of these things, is coming the anger of God upon the sons of obstinacy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Do not, then, become co-partners with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For ye were, at one time, darkness, but, now, are ye light in the Lord,as children of light, be walking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>For, the fruit of the light, is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Putting to the test what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And be not joining in fellowship in the unfruitful works of darkness, but, rather, be even administering reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For, of the secret things which are brought to pass by them, it is, shameful, even to speak!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>All things, however, when reproved by the light, become manifest, for, all that of itself maketh manifest, is, light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Wherefore it saithUp! thou sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and the Christ will shine upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Be taking heed, therefore, exactly how ye are walking,not as unwise, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>Buying out for yourselves the opportunity, because, the days, are evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>For this cause, do not become foolish, but have discernment as to what is the will of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not getting drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be getting filled in Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>Speaking to yourselves, with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; singing, and striking the strings, with your heart unto the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>Giving thanks, always, for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto your God and Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>Submitting yourselves one to another in reverence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Ye wives, unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>Because, a husband, is the head of his wife, as, the Christ also, is the head of the assembly, he, being the saviour of the body,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Nevertheless, as, the assembly, submitteth herself unto the Christ, so, the wives, unto their husbands, in everything:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Ye husbands, be loving your wives, even as, the Christ also, loved the assembly, and delivered, himself, up in her behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>That, her, he might sanctify, having purified   with the bath of water, in declaration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>That, he, might present, unto himself, the assembly, all glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any of such things, but that she should be holy and blameless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So, ought the husbands   to be loving their own wives, as their own bodies,he that loveth his own wife, loveth himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>No one, in fact, ever yet hated, his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,even as, the Christ, the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>Because, members, are we of his body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause, will a man leave his father and his mother, and will cleave unto his wife, and, they two, shall become, one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This sacred secret, is, great,I, however, am speaking as to Christ and  as to  the assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless, ye also, do ye, individually, each man be so loving, his own wife, as himself, and, the wife,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Ye children, be obedient unto your parents  in the Lord , for this is right:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honour thy father and thy mother,which indeed is the first commandment with promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>That it may come to be, well with thee, and thou shalt be long-lived upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And ye fathers, be not provoking your children to anger, but be nourishing them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Ye servants, be obedient unto them who, after the flesh, are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>Not by way of eye-service as man-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God, from the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will, rendering serviceas unto the Lord, and not unto men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>Knowing that, each one, whatsoever he may do that is good, the same, shall he receive back from the Lord, whether bond or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And ye masters, the same things, be doing towards them, forbearing your threatknowing that, both their and your Master, is in the heavens, and, respect of persons, there is none, with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>For the rest, be empowering yourselves in the Lord, and in the grasp of his might:</verse>
