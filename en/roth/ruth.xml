      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <title>Thus, the men of Israel, turned against the sons of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, beginning with the city, each and every one down to the beast, even to every one that was met with,moreover, all the cities they came to, they set on fire.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>And it came to pass, in the days when the Judges administered justice, that there was a famine in the land,and so a certain man went his way, out of Bethlehem-judah to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And, the name of the man, was Elimelech, and, the name of his wife, Naomi, and, the name of his two sons, Mahlon and ChilionEphrathites out of Bethlehem-judah,so they came into the country of Moab, and remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And Elimelech, husband of Naomi, died,and she was left, she and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>And they took them wives, of the women of Moab, the name of the one, was Orpah, and, the name of the other, Ruth,and they dwelt there, about ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>And, they also, both, died, Mahlon and Chilion,so the woman was bereft of her two sons, and of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>Then she arose, she and her daughters-in-law, and returned out of the country of Moab,for she had heard, in the country of Moab, how that Yahweh had visited his people, in giving unto them, bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>So she went forth out of the dwelling-place where she had remained, and her two daughters-in-law with her,and they went on the way, to return unto the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>Then said Naomi to her two daughters-in- law: Go return, each one to the house of her mother,Yahweh deal with you in lovingkindness, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>Yahweh grant you, that ye may find a place of rest, each one in the house of her husband,And she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>And they said to her,With thee, will we return, unto thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>Then said NaomiGo back, my daughters! wherefore should ye journey with me? Have I, yet, sons in my womb, that they should become your, husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Go back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband,If I should say, I have, hope, if I should, even to-night have a husband, and should, even bear sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>would ye, therefore, tarry until they were grown? would ye, therefore, shut yourselves up from having husbands? Nay! my daughters, for it is far more bitter for me than for you, that forth hath gone against me, the hand of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>And they lifted up their voice and wept, yet more. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in- law, but, Ruth, clave unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And she saidLo! thy sister-in-law hath gone back, unto her people, and unto her gods,go thou back, after thy sister-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And Ruth saidDo not urge me to leave thee, to go back from following thee,for, whither thou goest, I will go, and, where thou lodgest, I will lodge, thy people, shall be my people, and, thy God, my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>where thou diest, I will die, and, there, will I be buried: So, let Yahweh do to me, and, so, let him add, if, death itself, part me and thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And, when she saw that, bravely determined, was she to go with her, she ceased entreating her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>So, they two, went their way, until they entered Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they entered Bethlehem, that all the city was moved concerning them, and the women saidIs this Naomi?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>And she said unto them, Do not call me Naomi,call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me: \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I was full when I departed, but, empty, am I brought back of Yahweh,wherefore should ye call me Naomi, when, Yahweh, hath given answer against me, and, the Almighty, hath crushed me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab,and, they, entered Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>Now, Naomi, had an acquaintance of her husbands, a man of great integrity, of the family of Elimelech,whose name, was Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto NaomiLet me go, I pray thee, to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose eyes I may find favour. And she said to herGo, my daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>So she went her way, and came, and gleaned in the field, after the reapers,and it happened to her, to light upon the portion of field-land belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And lo! Boaz coming from Bethlehem, and he said to the reapers, Yahweh, be with you! and they said to him, Yahweh bless thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>Then said Boaz to his young man, that was set over the reapers,Whose is this maiden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And the young man that was set over the reapers answered and said,The Moabitish maiden, is she who came back with Naomi, out of the country of Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>and she saidLet me glean, I pray thee, and gather among the sheaves, after the reapers; so she came in, and hath continued from that time, all the morning until just now, and hath not rested in the house, for a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>And Boaz said unto RuthHearest thou not, my daughter? Do not go to glean in any other field, neither indeed shalt thou pass on, from hence,but, here, shalt thou keep fast by my maidens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>thine eyes, be on the field which they shall reap, and go thou after them, Have I not commanded the young men, that they touch thee not? And, when thou art athirst, then go unto the vessels, and drink of what the young men shall draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>Then she fell upon her face, and bowed herself to the ground,and said unto himWherefore have I found favour in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take notice of me, seeing that, I, am, a stranger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>And Boaz answered, and said to her, It hath been, told, meall that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law, since the death of thy husband,and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and come unto a people whom thou knewest not, aforetime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>Yahweh recompense thy deed,and let thy reward be full from Yahweh, the God of Israel, unto whom thou hast come to take refuge under his wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>And she saidLet me find favour in thine eyes, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken unto the heart of thy handmaid,though, I, be not as, one of thine own handmaidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And Boaz said to her at mealtimeDraw nigh hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat beside the reapers, and there was reached to her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>And, when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, sayingEven between the sheaves, let her glean, and reproach her not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>yea moreover, draw out, for her, from the bundles,and leave behind that she may glean it, and rebuke her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field, until the evening,and beat out that which she had gleaned, and there was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>And she took it up, and came into the city, and, when her mother-in-law had seen what she had gleaned, she brought forth and gave her what had been left remaining, after that she was satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And her mother-in-law said to herIn what place hast thou gleaned, today? and where hast thou wrought? May he that took notice of thee, be blessed! So she told her mother-in-law, with whom she had wrought, and saidThe name of the man with whom I wrought today, is Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>Then said Naomi, to her daughter-in-lawBlessed, be he of Yahweh, who hath not left off his lovingkindness to the living, and to the dead. And Naomi said to herNear to us, is the man, of our own kinsmen, is he!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>And Ruth the Moabitess said,Yea for he said unto meBy my young men, shalt thou keep fast, until they have ended all my harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law,Good, is it, my daughter, that thou go forth with his maidens, and that they meet thee not, in any other field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean, until the end of the barley harvest, and the wheat harvest,and dwelt with her mother-in-law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her,My daughter! shall I not seek for thee a place of rest, in which it may be well with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>Now, therefore, is not, Boaz, of our kindred, with whose maidens thou hast been? Lo! he is winnowing the barley threshing-floor, to-night!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>Thou wilt, therefore, bathe thee, and anoint thee, and put thine apparel upon thee, and go down to the threshing-floor,do not make thyself known to the man, until he have done eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he doth lie, and shalt go in and turn aside the covering of his feet, and lay thee down,and, he, will tell thee what thou shalt do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>And she said unto her,All that thou sayest, will I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>So she went down to the threshing-floor,and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And, when Boaz had eaten, and drunk, and his heart was glad, he went in to lie down at the end of the heap of corn. Then came she in softly, and turned aside the covering of his feet, and laid her down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And it came to pass, in the middle of the night, that the man started up, and turned,and lo! a woman, lying at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And he said, Who art, thou? And she said, I, am Ruth, thy handmaid, spread, therefore, thy wing over thy handmaid, for, a kinsman, thou art.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he saidBlessed, be thou of Yahweh, my daughter, for thou hast made thy last lovingkindness better than the first,in not following after young men, whether poor, or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>Now, therefore, my daughter, do not fear, whatsoever thou shalt say, I will do for thee,for all the gate of my people doth know, that, a virtuous woman, thou art.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>And, now, although it is true that, a kinsman, am I, yet is there a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Tarry the night, and it shall be, in the morning, if he will act as kinsman to thee, well, let him so act, but, if he inclineth not to act as kinsman to thee, then will, I, so act to theeby the life of Yahweh,Lie still, until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>So she lay at his feet, until the morning, and rose up before one could know his neighbour. And he saidDo not let it be known that a woman came into the threshing-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And he saidBring the cloak that is upon thee, and hold it. So she held it,and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her, and he went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And, when she came unto her mother-in- law, she saidWho art, thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And she saidThese six measures of barley, gave he unto me,for he said, Do not go in empty, unto thy mother-in- law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>And she saidAbide, my daughter, until that thou get to know, how the matter will fall out,for the man will not rest, except he have finished the thing to-day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>Now, Boaz, went up to the gate, and sat him down there, and lo! the kinsman, passing by, of whom Boaz had spoken, so he saidTurn aside! and sit down here, such a one! And he turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>Then fetched he ten men of the elders of the city, and saidSit ye down here. And they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>Then said he to the kinsman, The parcel of land that was our brother Elimelechs, is to be disposed of by Naomi, who hath returned out of the country of Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>and, I, thought, I would unveil thine ear, sayingTake it over in presence of such as are here seated, and in presence of the elders of my people. If thou wilt act as kinsman, act as kinsman, but, if thou wilt not so act, only tell methat I may know, for there is none who can set thee aside as kinsman, but, I, am after thee. And he said, I, will act as kinsman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>Then said Boaz, What day thou takest over the land from the hand of Naomi, also, of Ruth the Moabitess, wife of the dead, dost thou take   , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>Then said the kinsmanI cannot act as kinsman for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance,do, thou, for thyself act as kinsman in my right, for I cannot so redeem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>Now, this aforetime,   in Israel, at a redeeming, and at an exchanging, to confirm every word: A man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour,yea, this, was the way of taking to witness, in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>So the kinsman said unto Boaz, Take it over for thyself,and he drew off his shoe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>Then said Boaz to the elders, and all the peopleWitnesses, are ye to-day, that I have taken over all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions, and Mahlons,from the hand of Naomi:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, wife of Mahlon, have I taken over, to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut offfrom among his brethren, and from the gate of his dwelling- place,Witnesses, are ye to-day!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>Then said all the people who were in the gate, and the eldersWitnesses!,Yahweh grant the woman who is coming into thy house, to be as Rachel, and as Leah, which two of them did build the house of Israel. Do thou bravely, then, in Ephrathah, and proclaim thou a name in Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>And let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare to Judah,of the seed whichmay Yahweh give thee, of this young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in unto her,and Yahweh granted her conception, and she bare a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>Then said the women unto Naomi, Blessed, be Yahweh! who hath not let thee fail of a kinsman to-day,and may his name, be proclaimed, in Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>So shall he become a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age,for, thy daughter-in-law who loveth thee, hath borne him, even, she, who is better to thee than seven sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>So Naomi took the boy, and laid him in her bosom, and she became his nurse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>And the women, her neighbours, gave him a name, saying, There is born a son to Naomi,So they called his name Obed, he, was, the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>These, then, are the generations of Perez: Perez, begat, Hezron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>And, Hezron, begat, Ram, and, Ram, begat, Amminadab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>And, Amminadab, begat Nahshon, and, Nahshon, begat, Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>And, Salmon, begat, Boaz, and, Boaz, begat, Obed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>And, Obed, begat, Jesse, and, Jesse, begat, David.</verse>
