        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus, saith Cyrus, king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth, hath Yahweh God of the heavens, given to me,and, he himself, hath laid charge upon me, to build for him a house, in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>But, when the seventh month was come, and the sons of Israel were in cities, then did the people gather themselves together as one man, unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then aroseJeshua son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel,to offer thereon ascending-sacrifices, as it was written in the law of Moses, the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>So they settled the altar upon its stands, for, dread, was upon them, because of the peoples of the countries,therefore caused they to go up thereon, ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh, ascending-sacrifices for the morning and for the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the festival of booths, as it was written,and the ascending-offering of each day upon its own day, by number, according to regulation, the matter of a day upon its day;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month, began they to offer up ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh,but, the temple of Yahweh, had not had its foundation laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>And they gave silver, unto the masons and carpenters,and food and drink and oil, unto them of Zidon and unto them of Tyre, to bring in cedar-trees out of the Lebanon, unto the sea of Joppa, according to the grant of Cyrus king of Persia unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now, in the second year of their coming in unto the house of God, to Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brethrenthe priests and the Levites, and all that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, and stationed the Levites, of twenty years old and upwards, to preside over the work of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>So they took their stationeven Jeshua, his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, sons of Judah, as one man to preside over the doer of the work in the house of God, the sons of Henadad, their sons and their brethren, the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And, when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Yahweh, then the priests, enrobed, took their stand with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to offer praise unto Yahweh, after the instructions of David king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And, when they made responses in offering praise and in giving thanks unto YahwehFor he is good, for, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness, upon Israel, then, all the people, shouted with a great shout, in offering praise unto Yahweh, over the laying of the foundation of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But, many of the priests and the Levites and the ancestral chiefs, who were old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, were weeping with a loud voice,many, however, shouting and rejoicing, with voice raised on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not distinguish the noise of the shout of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people,for, the people, did shout with a great shout, and, the noise, was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now, when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heardthat, the Sons of the Exile, were building the temple, unto Yahweh, God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then drew they near unto Zerubbabel, and unto the ancestral chiefs, and said unto them, Let us build with you, for, like you, we seek your God, and, unto him, have, we, been sacrificing since the days of Esar-haddon, king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel and Joshua and the rest of the ancestral chiefs of Israel, said unto them, It pertaineth not to you and to us   , to build a house unto our God,but, we ourselves together, will build unto Yahweh, God of Israel, even as King Cyrus, king of Persia, hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then came it to pass, that, the people of the land, were weakening the hands of the people of Judah,and troubling them in building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hiring against them counselors, to overturn their purpose,all the days of Cyrus, king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And, in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation, against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And, in the days of Artaxerxes, wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates, unto Artaxerxes, king of Persia,and, the writing of the letter, was written in Aramean, and was to be interpreted as Aramean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum holder of judicial authority, and Shimshai the scribe, wrote a certain letter against Jerusalem,to Artaxerxes the king, thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then Rehum holder of judicial authority, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates,the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the peoples, whom the great and noble Osnappar hath exiled, and set in the city of Samaria,and the rest Beyond the River, and so forth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This, is a copy of the letter which they sent unto himunto Artaxerxes the king,Thy servants, the men Beyond the River and so forth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known unto the king,that, the Jews who came up from thee unto us, are come to Jerusalem,the rebellious and wicked city, are they building, and, the walls, have they finished, and, the foundations, will they repair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Now be it known to the king, that, if this city, be built, and, the walls thereof, be finished, neither, tribute, excise, nor toll, will they render, and so, the revenue of the kings, shalt thou damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now, because the salt of the palace we have eaten, the impoverishment of the king, it is not meet for us to see,therefore have we sent, and certified the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>so that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers, so shalt thou find out in the book of recordsand shalt ascertain, that, this city, is a rebellious city, and one that causeth damage unto kings and provinces, and that, rebellion, have they been wont to cause in the midst thereof since the days of age-past time,for this cause, was this city laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We do certify the king that, if, this city, be built, and, the walls thereof, finished, for that very reason, portion Beyond the River, shalt thou have none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The king sent, a message, unto Rehum holder of judicial authority, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, who were dwelling in Samaria, and the rest Beyond the River, Peace and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which ye sent unto us, was distinctly read before me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And, from me, went forth an edict, and they have made search and found, that, this city, since the days of age-past time, against kings, hath lifted herself up,and, sedition and rebellion, have been made therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>and, mighty kings, have there been over Jerusalem, and bearing rule everywhere Beyond the River,and, tribute, excise, and toll, have been given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Now, issue ye an edict, to forbid these men,that, this city, be not built, until, from me, the edict be issued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Beware, then, of failure to do thus,wherefore should the damage increase, to inflict loss on the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then, when, the copy of the letter of Artaxerxes the king, had been read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they journeyed in haste to Jerusalem, unto the Jews, and forbade them, with arm and force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then ceased the work of the house of God, which was in Jerusalem,yea it did cease, until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Then were moved to prophesy, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah son of Iddo, the prophets, unto the Jews who were in Judaea and in Jerusalem,in the name of the God of Israel, unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then aroseZerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God, which was in Jerusalem,and, with them, were the prophets of God, strengthening them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At that time, came unto them Tattenai pasha Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their associates,and, thus, spake they unto them, Who hath issued unto you an edict, this house, to build, and, this wall, to complete?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>Nevertheless, the eye of their God, was upon the elders of Judah, and they did not forbid them, until the matter, unto Darius, should come,and, then, answer be returned by letter, concerning this.</verse>
