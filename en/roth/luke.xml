      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <title>Now, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, were viewing how he had been laid.</title>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Seeing, indeed, that, many, had taken in hand to re-arrange for themselves a narrative, concerning the facts which have been fully confirmed amongst us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>according as they who from the beginning became eye-witnesses and attendants of the Word delivered them unto us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good, even to me, having closely traced from the outset all things accurately, to write unto thee, in order, most excellent Theophilus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that, as touching the matters which thou hadst been taught by word of mouth, thou mightest obtain full knowledge, of the certainty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>It came to pass, in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, that there was a certain priest, by name Zachariah, of the daily course of Abia; and that he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and, her name, was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>Now they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and righteous appointments of the Lord, blameless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>and they had no child, inasmuch as Elizabeth was barren, and, both, had become, advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>But it came to pass, as he was doing priestly service in the order of his daily course, before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of his priesthood, it fell to his lot to offer incense, entering into the Temple of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>and, all the throng of the people, was praying outside, at the hour of the incense offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared unto him a messenger of the Lord, standing on the right hand of the altar of incense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>and Zachariah was troubled when he beheld, and, fear, fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the messenger said unto himDo not fear, Zachariah! Inasmuch as thy supplication hath been hearkened to,and, thy wife Elizabeth, shall bring forth a son to thee, and thou shalt call his name, John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And there shall be joy to thee and exulting, and, many, over his birth, shall rejoice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord, and, wine and strong drink, in nowise may he drink, and, with Holy Spirit, shall he be filled, already, from his mothers womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And, many of the Sons of Israel, shall he turn towards the Lord their God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And, he, shall go before him, in the spirit and power of Elijah,To turn the hearts of fathers unto children, and the unyielding, into the prudence of the righteous, and to prepare, for the Lord, a people made ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zachariah said unto the messengerWhereby, shall I know this? for, I, am, aged, and, my wife, advanced in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the messenger, answering, said unto himI, am Gabriel,he that standeth near before God; and have been sent forth to speak unto thee, and to deliver the joyful message unto thee, as touching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And lo! thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak until the day when these things shall come to pass; because thou didst not believe in my words,the which shall be fulfilled for their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were expecting Zachariah, and began to marvel that he should tarry in the Temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>and when he came forth he was not able to speak unto them, and they perceived that, a vision, he had seen in the Temple,and, he, continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his public ministration were fulfilled, that he departed unto his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And, after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she disguised herself five months, saying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus, for me, hath the Lord wrought,in the days in which he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now, in the sixth month, was the messenger Gabriel sent forth from God, into a city of Galilee, the name of which was Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>unto a virgin, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and, the name of the virgin, was, Mary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>and entering in unto her, he saidJoy to thee, favoured one! The Lord, be with thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And, she, at the word, was greatly troubled, and began to deliberate, of what kind, this salutation, might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the messenger said unto herDo not fear, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And 1o! thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name, Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>the same, shall be great, and, Son of the Most High, shall be called, and the Lord God, will give unto him, the throne of David his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob, unto the ages, and, of his kingdom, there shall be, no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>But Mary said unto the messengerHow, shall this thing be, seeing that, a man, I know not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And answering, the messenger said unto herThe Holy Spirit, shall come upon thee, and, the power of the Most High, shall overshadow thee; wherefore, even that which is to be born, Holy, shall be called, Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And lo! Elizabeth thy kinswoman, even she, hath conceived a son in, her old-age;and, this month, is, the sixth, to her, the so-called barren one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>Because no declaration from God, shall be void of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary saidLo! the handmaid of the Lord! Might it come to pass unto me, according to thy declaration. And the messenger departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary, arising, in these days, journeyed into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass that, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and lifted up her voice with loud exclamation, and saidBlessed, art thou among women, and, blessed, is the fruit of thy womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And, whence, to me is, this, That the mother of my Lord should come, unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For lo! as the sound of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe in my womb, leapt in exultation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And, happy, is she who hath believed, that there shall be a perfecting of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary saidMy soul doth magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit hath exulted upon God my saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because he hath looked upon the humbling of his handmaid; for lo! from the present time, all the generations, will pronounce me happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Because he that is mighty hath done for me great things, and, holy, is his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is unto generations and generations, to them who revere him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath wrought strength with his arm, He hath scattered men arrogant in the intention of their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath deposed potentates from thrones, and uplifted the lowly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry, hath he filled with good things, and, the wealthy, hath he sent empty away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath laid hold of Israel his servant, to be mindful of mercies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>According as he spake unto our fathers,To Abraham, and to his seed,Unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>And, to Elizabeth, was the time fulfilled, that she should be bringing forth,and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard, that the Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they were rejoicing with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it, after the name of its father, Zachariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother, answering, saidNay! but he shall be called, John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said unto herThere is, no one from among thy kindred, who is called by this name!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they began making signs unto his father, as to what he might be wishing it to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And, asking for a small tablet, he wrote, sayingJohn, is his name! and they marvelled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue   , and he began to speak, blessing, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came upon all the neighbours themselves; and, throughout all the hill-country of Judaea, were all these matters being much talked of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>and all who heard laid</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And, Zachariah his father, was filled with Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed, be the Lord, the God of Israel! Because he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us, In the house of David his servant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>According as he hath spoken by mouth of his holy ancient prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Of salvation from among our foes, and out of the hand of all them that hate us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform mercy with our fathers, and to be mindful of his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he sware unto Abraham our father, To grant us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>without fear, from the hand of enemies rescued, to be rendering divine service unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in lovingkindness and righteousness before him, all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And, even thou, child, prophet of the Most High, shalt be called,for thou shall march on before the Lord, to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>Giving a knowledge of salvation unto his people, by a remission of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Because of the yearning compassion of the mercy of our God, wherein shall visit us a day-dawn from on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To shine on them who, in the darkness and shade of death, are sitting, to guide our feet into a way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And, the child, went on growing, and being strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts, until the day he was pointed out unto Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it came to pass, in those days, that there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>this enrolment, first was made while Cyrenius was governor of Syria:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>and all were journeying to be enrolled, each one unto his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of a city Nazareth, into Judaea, into the city of David which is called Bethlehem; because he was of the house and family of David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to enrol himself with Mary who was betrothed to him, she being with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass, while they were there, that the days were fulfilled for her to give birth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were, shepherds, in the same country, dwelling in the fields, and keeping the watches of the night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, a messenger of the Lord, stood over them, and, a glory of the Lord, shone round about them; and they feared, a great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the messenger said unto themBe not afraid! For lo! I bring you good tidings of a great joy, the which shall be for all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>That there hath been born unto you, this day, a saviour,Who is Christ the Lordin the city of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And, this, to you is, a sign: Ye shall find a babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And, suddenly, there came to be, with the messenger, the throng of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory, in the highest, unto God! And, on earth, peace, among men of goodwill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, when the messengers had departed from them into heaven, that, the shepherds, began to say one to anotherLet us go through forthwith as far as to Bethlehem, and see this thing which hath come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came, with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>Now, when they beheld, they made known concerning the thing which had been told them as to this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And, all who heard, marvelled concerning the things which had been told by the shepherds unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>but, Mary, was closely observing, all, these things, putting them together in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, giving glory and singing praise unto God, over all things which they had heard and seen, according as it had been told unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And, when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, then was his name called, Jesus,which it was called by the messenger, before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And, when the days of their purification, according to the law of Moses, were fulfilled, they took him up into Jerusalem, to present   unto the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>according as it is written in the law of the LordEvery male that is a firstborn, Holy unto the Lord, shall be called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to give a sacrifice, according to that which is said in the law of the LordA pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And lo! there was, a man, in Jerusalem, whose name, was Symeon; and, this man, was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and Holy Spirit was upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>and it had been intimated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came, in the Spirit, into the temple; and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do according to that which was customary by the law concerning it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>even he, welcomed it into his arms, and blessed God, and said</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now, dost thou dismiss thy servant, O Sovereign, according to thy declarationin peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>Because mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which thou hast prepared in face of all the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light for the unveiling of nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and mother were marvelling over the things which were being spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Symeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his motherLo! this one, is being set for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign to be spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>And, thou! through thy very soul, shall pass a sword, that, reasonings, may be revealed, out of many hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher;the same, advanced in many days; having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and, she, had been a widow for as long as eighty-four years,who left not the temple, with fastings and supplications, rendering divine service night and day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>and, in that very hour, coming near, she began to give thanks unto God, and to speak concerning him unto all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And, when they had finished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, into their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And, the child, went on growing, and waxing strong, becoming filled with wisdom; and, the favour of God, was upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents used to journey yearly into Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And, when he became twelve years, and they went up, according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and completed the days, and then were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,and his parents noticed it not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but, supposing him to be in the company, went a days journey, and then began to seek for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and, not finding him, returned unto Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting amidst the teachers,both hearkening unto them, and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>Now all who heard him were beside themselves, because of his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And, when they behold him, they were astounded, and his mother said unto himChild! why, hast thou dealt with us, thus? Lo! thy father and I, in anguish, were seeking thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said unto themWhy was it that ye were seeking me? Perceived ye not, that, in the courts of my Father, I must needs be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And, they, understood not the thing which he spake to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was submitting himself unto them. And, his mother, was closely observing all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And, Jesus, went on advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now, in the fifteenth year of the supremacy of Tiberius Caesar,Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and, Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanius, tetrarch of Abylene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the High-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, came a word of God unto John the son, of Zechariah, in rue desert;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>and he came into all the country about the Jordan, proclaiming an immersion of repentance into remission of sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the discourses of Isaiah the prophet: A voice of one crying aloud! In the desert, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every chasm, shall be filled up, and, every mountain and hill, be made low; and the, crooked, places shall become, straight, and the, rugged, places, smooth ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>And he went on to question him in a good many words; but, he, answered him, nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiery, having set him at nought, and mocked him, threw about him a gorgeous robe, and sent him back unto Pilate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people were standing, looking on. But the rulers were sneering, sayingOthers, he saved, let him save himself,if, this, is, the Christ of God, the Chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>Moreover the soldiers also mocked him,coming near, offering, vinegar, unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and sayingIf, thou, art the King of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>Now there was an inscription also, over himTHE KING OF THE JEWS, THIS!</verse>
