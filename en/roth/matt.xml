        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The Lineage Roll of Jesus Christ,Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob, begat Judah and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judah begat Perez and Zarah of Tamah, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nashon, and Nashon begat Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse begat David the King. And David begat Solomon of her   of Uriah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josiah begat Jechoniah, and his brethren,upon the removal to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And, after the removal to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So then, all the generations from Abraham unto David, are, fourteen, generations, and, from David unto the removal to Babylon, fourteen, generations; and, from the removal to Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen, generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth, of  Jesus  Christ, was, thus: His mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph,before they came together, she was found with child by   Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Moreover, Joseph her husband, being, righteous, and yet unwilling to expose her,intended, privately, to divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But, when, these things, he had pondered, lo! a messenger of the Lord, by dream, appeared to him, saying,Joseph, son of David! do not fear to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for, that which, in her, hath been begotten, is of   , Holy, Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>Moreover she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus,for, he, will save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>But, all this, hath come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord, through the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Lo! a Virgin, shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,and they shall call his name Emmanuel; which is, being translated, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, awaking, from his sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him,and took unto him his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not, until she had brought forth a son,and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now, when, Jesus, was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, lo! wise men from eastern parts, came into Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>sayingWhere is he that hath been born king of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and have come to bow down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But, when King Herod heard, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and, assembling all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he was enquiring of themWhere is, the Christ, to be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And, they, said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea,for, so, is it written through the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And, thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means least, art thou, among the governors of Judah,For, out of thee, shall one come forth to govern, Who shall shepherd my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, privately, calling the wise men, ascertained from them the time of the appearing star;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and sending them to Bethlehem, saidGo search out accurately concerning the child,and, as soon as ye find it, bring report unto me, that, I also, may come and bow myself down to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>Now, they, hearing the king, went, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east, was going before them, until it went and stood over where the child was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>and, seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and, coming into the house, they saw the child, with Mary its mother,and, falling down, prostrated themselves unto it, and, opening their treasures, offered unto it giftsgold and frankincense and myrrh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>and, being instructed by dream, not to return unto Herod, by another way, retired they unto their own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now, when they had retired, lo! a messenger of the Lord, appeareth by dream unto Joseph, saying, Arise, take unto thee the child and its mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there, until I tell thee,for Herod is about to seek the child, to destroy it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And, he, arising, took unto him the child and its mother, by night, and retired into Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there, until the death of Herod,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt, called I my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly enraged,and sent and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its bounds, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled, that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice, in Ramah, was heard, weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted,because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But, when Herod was, dead, lo! a messenger of the Lord, appeareth by dream unto Joseph in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>sayingArise! and take unto thee the child and its mother, and be journeying into the land of Israel,for they are dead, who were seeking the life of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And, he, arising, took unto him the child and its mother, and entered into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>Hearing, however, that, Archelaus, was reigning over Judaea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid, thither, to go,and so, being instructed by dream, he retired into the parts of Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and came and fixed his dwelling in a city called Nazareth,that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophetsA Nazarene, shall he be called.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>Now, in those days, came John the Immerser, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judaea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>saying, Repent ye,for the kingdom of the heavens hath drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For, this, is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice, of one crying aloud! In the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>But John, himself, had his raiment of camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins,while, his food, was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then, were going forth unto himJerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round about the Jordan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were being immersed in the Jordan river, by him, openly confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But, seeing, many of the Pharisees and Sadducees, coming unto his immersion, he said to them,Broods of vipers! who suggested to you, to be fleeing from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and think not to be saying within yourselves,As our father, we have, Abraham; for, I say unto you, that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Already also, the axe, unto the root of the trees, is being laid,every tree, therefore, not bringing forth good fruit, is to be hewn down, and, into fire, to be cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, am immersing you, in water, unto repentance,but, he who, after me, cometh is, mightier than I, whose, sandals, I am not worthy to bear, he, will immerse you, in Holy Spirit and fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will clear out his threshing-floor,and will gather his wheat into the granary, but, the chaff, will he burn up with fire unquenchable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then, cometh Jesus, from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John,to be immersed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But, he, would have hindered him, sayingI, have, need, by thee, to be immersed,and dost, thou, come unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answering, said unto him, Suffer   even now,for, thus, it becometh us, to fulfil, all righteousness; then, he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, having been immersed, straightway, went up from the water,and lo! the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God, descending like a dove coming upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and lo! a voice out of the heavens,saying, This, is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then, Jesus was led up into the wilderness, by the Spirit, to be tempted by the adversary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and, fasting forty days and forty nights,afterwards, he hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And, coming near, the tempter said to him,If thou art Gods, Son, speak! that, these stones, may become, loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But, he, answering, said, It is written,Not on bread alone, shall man live, but on every declaration coming forth through the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then, the adversary taketh him with him, unto the holy city,and he set him upon the pinnacle of the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and saith to himIf thou art Gods, Son, cast thyself down,for it is written, To his messengers, will he give charge concerning thee; and, on hands, will they bear thee up, lest once thou strike, against a stone, thy foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, Again, it is written,Thou shalt not put to the test, the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the adversary taketh him with him, into an exceeding high mountain,and pointeth out to him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, All these things, will I give thee,if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then saith Jesus unto him, Withdraw, Satan! for it is written,The Lord thy God, shalt thou worship, and, to him alone, render divine service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then, the adversary leaveth him,and lo! messengers came near, and began ministering unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And, hearing that, John, had been delivered up, he retired into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and, forsaking Nazareth, he came and fixed his dwelling in Capernaum, which was by the lake,within the bounds of Zebulun and Naphtali:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zebulun, and land of Naphtali, the lake-way across the Jordan,Galilee of the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people that was sitting in darkness, a great light, beheld,and, on them who were sitting in land and shade of death, Light rose on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time, began Jesus to be making proclamation, and saying,Repent ye, for the kingdom of the heavens hath drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And, walking round beside the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethrenSimon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother,casting a large fishing-net into the sea, for they were fishers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he saith unto them, Come after me,and I will make you fishers, of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And, they, straightway, leaving the nets, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And, going forward from thence, he saw other two brethrenJames the son of Zebedee, and John his brotherin the boat with Zebedee their father, putting in order their nets,and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And, they, straightway, leaving the boat and their father, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus was going round throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad-message of the kingdom,and curing every disease, and every infirmity, among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And forth went the report of him into all Syria; and they brought unto him all who were sick, with divers diseases and tortures, distressed, demonized and lunatic and paralyzed,and he cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him large multitudesfrom Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and across the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>But, seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain,and, when he had taken a seat, his disciples came unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and, opening his mouth, he began teaching them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Happy, the destitute, in spirit; for, theirs, is the kingdom of the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Happy, they who mourn; for, they, shall be comforted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Happy, the meek; for, they, shall inherit the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Happy, they who hunger and thirst for righteousness; for, they, shall be filled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Happy, the merciful; for, they, shall receive mercy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Happy, the pure, in heart; for, they, shall, see God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Happy, the peacemakers; for, they, shall be, called sons of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Happy, they who have been persecuted for righteousness sake; for, theirs, is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Happy, are ye, whensoever they may reproach you and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, falsely, for my sake:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and exult, because, your reward, is great in the heavens; for, so, persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>Ye, are the salt of the earth; but, if the salt become tasteless, wherewith shall it be salted? it is good, for nothing, any more, save, being cast out, to be trampled on by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>Ye, are the light of the world: it is impossible for a city to be hid, on the top of a mountain, lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither light they a lamp, and place it under the measure; but upon the lampstand, and it giveth light to all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>In like manner, let your light shine before men,that they may see your good works,and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think, that I came to pull down the law, or the prophets,I came not to pull down, but to fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For, verily, I say unto you, until the heaven and the earth shall pass away, one least letter, or one point, may in nowise pass away from the law, till all be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever, therefore, shall relax one of these commandments, the least, and teach men so, shall be called, least, in the kingdom of the heavens; but, whosoever shall do and teach, the same, shall be called, great, in the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say unto you, that, unless your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, in nowise, may ye enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>Ye have heard, that it was said, to them of olden time,Thou shalt not commit murder, and, whosoever shall commit murder, shall be, liable, to judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But, I, say unto you, that, every one who is angry with his brother, shall be, liable, to judgment,and, whosoever shall say to his brother, Worthless one!, shall be, liable, to the high council; and, whosoever shall say, Rebel!, shall be, liable, unto the fiery gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If, therefore, thou be bearing thy gift towards the altar, and, there, shouldst remember that, thy brother, hath aught against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave, there, thy gift before the altar, and withdraw,first, be reconciled unto thy brother, and, then, coming, be offering thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be making agreement with thine adversary, quickly, while thou art with him, in the way,lest once thine adversary deliver thee up unto the judge, and the judge, unto the officer, and, into prison, thou be cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily, I say unto thee, In nowise, mayest thou come out from thence, until thou pay the last halfpenny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>Ye have heard, that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But, I, say unto you, that, Every one who looketh on a woman so as to covet her, already, hath committed adultery with her, in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And, if, thy right eye, is causing thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee,for it profiteth thee, that, one of thy members, should perish, and not, thy whole body, be cast into gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And, if, thy right hand, is causing thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee,for it profiteth thee, that, one of thy members, should perish, and not, thy whole body, into gehenna, depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It was said, moreover, Whosoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But, I, say unto you, that, Everyone who divorceth his wifesaving for unfaithfulness, causeth her to be made an adulteress, and, whosoever shall marry a divorced woman, committeth adultery .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, ye have heard that it was said, to them of olden time, Thou shalt not swear falsely,but shalt render unto the Lord, thine oaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But, I, tell younot to swear, at all: Neither by heaven, because it is the, throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth, because it is his, footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because, it is the, city, of the Great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Nor, by thine own head, mayest thou swear, because thou art not able to make, one hair, white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be, Yea, yea,Nay, nay; and, what goeth beyond these, is, of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>Ye have heard, that it was said,Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But, I, tell you, not to resist evil,Nay, whoever is smiting thee on the right cheek, turn to him, the other also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And, him who is desiring thee to be judged, and to take, thy tunic, let him have, thy mantle also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another parable,  spake he unto them :The kingdom of the heavens is like, unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until, the whole, was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these things, spake Jesus in parables, unto the multitudes, and, without a parable, was he speaking, nothing, unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken through the prophet, sayingI will open, in parables, my mouth, I will bring up things hidden from the foundation!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>And, he, answering, saidHe that soweth the good seed, is the Son of Man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>And, the field, is the world, and, the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom,and, the darnel seeds, are the sons of the evil one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>And, the enemy that sowed them, is the adversary, and, the harvest, is, the conclusion of an age, and, the reapers, are, messengers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>Just, therefore, as collected is the darnel, and, with fire is burned, so, will it be in the conclusion of the age:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send forth his messengers, and they will collect, out of his kingdom, all the causes of stumbling, and the doers of lawlessness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and will cast them into the furnace of fire: there, will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then, the righteous, will shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>The kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a treasure hid in the field, which a man, finding, hid,and, by reason of his joy, withdraweth and selleth whatsoever he hath, and buyeth that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is, like, unto, a merchant, seeking beautiful pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.46'>and, finding one very precious pearl, departing, he at once sold all things, whatsoever he had, and bought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto, a large drag-net, cast into the sea and gathering of every kind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>which, when it was filled, they dragged up on the beach, and, sitting down, collected the good into vessels, but, the worthless, forth they cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>So, will it be in the conclusion of the age: The messengers will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.2'>Now, five of them, were foolish, and, five, prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.3'>For, the foolishthough they took, their torches, took not with them, oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.4'>But, the prudent, took oil in their vessels, with their torches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.5'>Now, the bridegroom, delaying, they all became drowsy, and were sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.6'>And, at midnight, an outcry hath been madeLo! the bridegroom! Be going forth to meet him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.7'>Then, arose all those virgins, and trimmed their torches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.8'>And, the foolish, unto the prudent, saidGive us of your oil, because, our torches, are going out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.9'>But the prudent, answered, sayingLest once, by any means, there be not enough for us and you, be going rather unto them that sell, and buy for yourselves</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.10'>But, as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and, they who were ready, went in with him, into the marriage-feast, and, the door was locked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.11'>But, afterwards, came the other virgins also, sayingLord! Lord! open unto us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.12'>And, he, answering, saidVerily, I say unto you, I know you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.13'>Be watching, therefore, because ye know, neither the day nor the hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.14'>For it is, just as a man, who, going from home, called his own servants, and delivered up to them his substance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.15'>And, to one, indeed, gave he five talents, and, to another, two, and, to another, one,to each according to his particular ability, and went from home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.16'>Straightway, he who, the five talents, had received, went and traded with them, and gained other five:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.17'>Likewise, he of the two, gained other two:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.18'>But, he who the one had received, went away, and digged up ground, and hid the silver of his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.19'>And, after a long time, cometh the lord of those servants, and reckoneth with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.20'>And he who the five talents had received, coming forward, brought other five talents, saying,Lord! five talents, to me, thou didst deliver up: See! other five talents, I gained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.21'>His lord said unto himWell-done! good and faithful servant,Over a few things wast thou faithful, over many things, will I appoint thee: Enter into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.22'>He also of the two talents, coming forward, saidLord! two talents, to me, didst thou deliver up: See! other two talents, I gained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.23'>His lord said unto himWell-done! good and faithful servant,Over a few things, wast thou faithful, over many things, will I appoint thee: Enter into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.24'>But he also who, the one talent, had received, coming forward, saidLord I knew thee, that thou art a, hard, man, reaping, where thou hast not sown,and gathering, whence thou hast not winnowed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.25'>And, overcome with fear, I went away, and hid thy talent in the ground: See! thou hast what is thine!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.26'>And his lord, answering, said unto himO wicked servant, and cowardly, knewest thou that I reap, where I have not sown, and gather, whence I have not winnowed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.27'>It was binding on thee, therefore, to cast my silver into the money-changers,and, I, when I, came, might have obtained what was mine, with interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.28'>Therefore take away, from him, the talent, and give unto him that hath the ten talents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.29'>For, to every one that hath, shall be given, and he shall be made to abound; but, from him that hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken away from him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.30'>And, the unprofitable servant, cast ye forth into the darkness, outside: There, shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.31'>But, whensoever the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the messengers with him, then will he sit on his throne of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.32'>And there will be gathered before him, all the nations, and he will separate them one from another, just as, the shepherd! separateth the sheep from the goats,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.33'>And he will set, the sheep, indeed, on his right hand, but, the goats, on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.34'>Then, will the king say to those on his right hand: Come ye, the blessed of my Father! Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.35'>For I hungered, and ye gave me to eat, I thirsted, and ye gave me drink, a stranger, was I, and ye took me home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.36'>Naked, and ye clothed me, sick, and ye visited me, in prison, was I, and ye came unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.37'>Then, will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord! when, saw we theehungry, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.38'>And, when, saw we theea stranger, and took thee home, or naked, and clothed thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.39'>And, when, saw we theesick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.40'>And, answering, the king will say unto them: Verily, I say unto youInasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my least brethren, unto me, ye did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.41'>Then, will he say unto those also, on his left hand: Depart ye from me, accursed ones! Into the age-abiding fire, which hath been prepared for the adversary and his messengers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.42'>For I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat,  and  I was thirsty, and ye gave me not to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.43'>A stranger, was I, and ye took me not home, naked, and ye clothed me not, sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.44'>Then, will, they also, answer, saying: Lord! when saw we theehungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered not unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.45'>Then, will he answer them, saying: Verily, I say unto youInasmuch as ye did it not, unto one of these least, neither unto me, did ye it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.46'>And, these, shall go away, into, age-abiding, correction, but, the righteous, into, age-abiding, life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it came to pass, when Jesus ended all these words, he said unto his disciples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>Ye know that, after two days, the passover, taketh place,and, the Son of Man, is to be delivered up, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then, were gathered together, the High-priests and the Elders of the people, into the court of the High-priest who was called Caiaphas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and they took counsel together, in order that, Jesus, by guile, they might secure, and slay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>They were saying, however: Not during the feast, lest, an uproar, arise among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>But, Jesus, happening to be in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>there came unto him a woman, holding an alabaster-jar of costly perfume, and she poured it down upon his head, as he was reclining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>And the disciples, seeing it, were greatly displeased, sayingTo what end, this loss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this could have been sold for much, and given to the destitute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, taking note, said unto themWhy vex ye the woman? for, a seemly work, hath she wrought for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For, always, the destitute, have ye with you,but, me, not always, have ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For, she, pouring this perfume upon my body, so as to prepare me for burial, did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Verily, I say unto youWheresoever this glad-message shall be proclaimed in all the world, also what she did, will be told, as a memorial of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then, went one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, unto the High-priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and saidWhat are ye willing to give unto me? and, I, unto you, will deliver him up. And they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And, from that time, was he seeking a favourable opportunity that he might, deliver him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>And, on the first of the days of unleavened bread, the disciples came unto Jesus, sayingWhere wilt thou, that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And, he, saidGo your way into the city, unto such-a-one, and say to him, The teacher, saith, My season, is, near, with thee, will I keep the passover, with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did, as Jesus directed them, and made ready the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And, when, evening, came, he was reclining with the twelve  disciples ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>and, as they were eating, he saidVerily, I say unto you, One from among you, will deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And, being exceedingly grieved, they began to be saying to him, each oneCan it be, I, Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And, he, answering, saidHe who hath dipped with me his hand in the bowl, the same, will deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man, indeed, goeth his way, according as it is written concerning him,But alas! for that man, through whom the Son of Man, is being delivered up: Well, had it been for him, if, that man, had not been born!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas, who was delivering him up, answering, saidCan it be, I, Rabbi? He saith unto himThou, hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And, as they were eating, Jesus, taking a loaf and blessing, brake,and, giving to his disciples, saidTake, eat! This, is, my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And, taking a cup, and giving thanks, he gave unto them, sayingDrink of it, all of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For, this, is my blood of the covenant, which, for many, is to be poured out, for remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>Moreover, I say unto youIn nowise, will I drink, henceforth, of this produce of the vine, until that day, whensoever I shall drink it with you, new, in the kingdom of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And, having sung praise, they went forth unto the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then, Jesus saith unto themAll ye, will find cause of stumbling in me, during this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and, the sheep of the flock, will be scattered abroad;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But, after my arising, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Now Peter, answering, said unto himThough, all, shall find cause of stumbling in thee, I, shall never find cause of stumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus saith unto him: Verily, I say unto theeDuring this night, before a cock crow, Thrice, wilt thou deny me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter saith unto him: Even though it be needful for me, with thee to die, in nowise, will I deny thee. Likewise, all the disciples also, said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus cometh with them, into a place called Gethsemane,and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And, taking with him, Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and to be in great distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then, saith he unto them: Encompassed with grief, is my soul, unto death: Abide ye here, and be watching with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And, going forward a little, he fell upon his face, offering prayer, and sayingMy Father! If it is possible, let this cup pass from me,Nevertheless, not as, I, will, but as, thou, wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he cometh unto his disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and said unto PeterThus, powerless are ye, one hour, to watch with me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Be watching and praying, that ye may not enter into temptation: The spirit, indeed, is, eager, but, the flesh, weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time, departing he prayed, saying: My Father! If it is impossible for this to pass, except I, drink, it, Accomplished, be, thy will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And coming, he, again, found them sleeping, for their eyes had become heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And, leaving them, he, again, departed, and prayed a third time, the same word, saying again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then, cometh he unto the disciples, and saith unto them,Ye are sleeping what time remaineth, and taking your rest: Lo! the hour hath drawn near, and, the Son of Man, is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise! let us be going,Lo! he that delivereth me up, hath drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And, while, yet, he was speaking, lo! Judas, one of the twelve, came, and, with him, a large multitude, with swords and clubs, from the High-priests and Elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>And, he who was delivering him up, gave them a sign, sayingWhomsoever I shall kiss, he, it is,secure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And, straightway, coming unto Jesus, he saidJoy to thee! Rabbi, and eagerly kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But, Jesus, said unto himFriend! wherefore art thou here? Then, coming forward, they thrust their hands upon Jesus, and secured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And lo! one of those with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, grasped his sword, and smiting the servant of the High-priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then, Jesus saith unto himPut back thy sword into its place, for, all they who take a sword, by a sword, shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or thinkest thou that I cannot call upon my Father, and he will set near me, even now, more than twelve legions of messengers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that, thus, it must needs come to pass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour, said Jesus unto the multitudes: As against a robber, came ye forth, with swords and clubs, to arrest me? Daily in the temple, used I to sit teaching, and ye secured me not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But, this, hath, wholly, come to pass, that, the Scriptures of the prophets, may be fulfilled. Then, the disciples, all forsaking him, fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And, they who secured Jesus, led him away unto Caiaphas the High-priest, where the Scribes and the Elders gathered themselves together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Now, Peter, was following him afar off, unto the court of the High-priest,and, entering within, was sitting with the attendants, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now, the High-priests and all the High-council, were seeking false-witness against Jesus, that they might, put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and found not any, though many came forward as false-witnesses. At length, however, there came forward, two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said: This, man saidI am able to pull down the shrine of God, and, in three days, to, build, it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the High-priest, arising, said unto himNothing, answerest thou? What are these, against thee bearing witness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But, Jesus, was silent. And, the High-priest, said unto him: I put thee on oath, by the Living God, that, to us, thou sayWhether, thou, art the Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus saith unto him: Thou, hast said; Moreover, I say unto youHereafter, ye will see the Son of Man, sitting on the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then, the High-priest rent asunder his garments, sayingHe hath spoken profanely! What further need have we, of witnesses? Lo! now, ye have heard the profanity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>How, to you, doth it seem? And, they, answering, said: Guilty of death, he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then, spat they into his face, and buffeted him; and, others, struck him smartly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>sayingProphesy unto us, O Christ! Who is he that struck thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now, Peter, was sitting without, in the court; and there came unto him a certain female servant, sayingThou also, wast with Jesus, the Galilaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But, he, denied before all, sayingI know not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And, when he went out into the porch, another female saw him, and said unto them who were thereThis, one was with Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And, again, he denied, with an oathI know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And, after a little, the by-standers, coming forward, said unto Peter: Truly, thou also, art, from among them, for, thy very speech, maketh thee, manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then, began he to be cursing and swearingI know not the man! And, straightway, a cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter was put in mind of the declaration of Jesus, of his having saidBefore a cock crow, thrice, wilt thou utterly deny me; and, going forth outside, he wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now, when morning came, all the High-priests and Elders of the people took, counsel, against Jesus, so as to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>and, binding him, they led him away, and delivered him up unto Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then, Judas who had delivered him up, seeing that he was condemned, being smitten with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver unto the High-priests and Elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>sayingI have sinned, in delivering up righteous blood. But, they, saidWhat is that to us? thou, shalt see to it for thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And, throwing the pieces of silver into the Temple, he withdrew, and, going away, hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But, the High-priests, taking the pieces of silver, saidIt is not allowed, to cast them into the treasury; since, a price of blood, they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And, taking counsel, they bought with them, the field of the potter, as a burial-place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore, that field hath been called Field of Blood, until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then, was fulfilled, that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, as the value of him whom they had valued, whom they had valued, of Israels sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>And gave them for the field of the potter, as, the Lord, directed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now, Jesus, stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, sayingThou, art the king of the Jews? And, Jesus, saidThou, sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And, while he was being accused by the High-priests and Elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then, Pilate saith unto himHearest thou not how many things against thee they are bearing witness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he answered him, no not so much as a single word, so that the governor was marvelling exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>But, feast by feast, the governor had been wont to release one unto the multitude, a prisoner whom they were desiring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>Now they had at that time a distinguished prisoner, called, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>They therefore having come together, Pilate, said to themWhom will ye I should release unto you? Barabbas? or Jesus, who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that, for envy, they had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And, as he was sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man, for, many things, have I suffered this day, by dream, because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But, the High-priests and the elders, persuaded the multitudes, that they should claim Barabbas, but, Jesus, should, destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>Now the governor, answering, said unto themWhich of the two desire ye I should release unto you? And they saidBarabbas!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate saith unto themWhat then shall I do unto Jesus, who is called Christ? They all sayLet him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>But, he, saidIndeed! what evil hath he done? But, they, vehemently, were crying aloud, sayingLet him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate, seeing, that, nothing, it availed, but rather, a tumult, was arising, taking water, washed his hands of it before the multitude, sayingInnocent, am I, of the blood of this man,Ye, shall see to it for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people, answering, saidHis blood be upon us and upon our children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then released he unto them Barabbas, but, scourging, Jesus, delivered him up, that he might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor, taking Jesus aside into the judgment-hall, gathered unto him all the band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>and, unclothing him, a scarlet scarf, put they about him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and, plaiting a crown out of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand,and, kneeling before him, began to mock him, sayingJoy to thee, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And, spitting upon him, they took the reed, and began striking upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And, when they had mocked him, they put off him the scarf, and put on him his garments, and led him away unto the crucifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And, as they were going forth, they found a man of Cyrene, by name, Simon,the same, they impressed to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And, coming into a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Skull-place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him to drink, wine, with gall, mingled, and, tasting, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And, having crucified him, they parted among themselves his garments, casting a cloth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>and, being seated, were watching him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up, over his head, his accusation, writtenTHIS, IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then, are crucified with him, two robbers,one on the right hand, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And, they who were passing by, were reviling him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and sayingThe man that taketh down the Temple and in three days buildeth it! Save, thyself! If thou art Gods, Son, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise, the High-priests,  also , mocking, with the Scribes and Elders, were saying: Others, he saved,Himself, he cannot save:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>Israels King, he is! Let him come down, now, from the cross,and we will believe on him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He hath put confidence upon God, Let him rescue him, now, if he desireth him; for he said, I am, Gods Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And, the same thing, the robbers also, who were crucified with him, were casting in his teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now, from the sixth hour, darkness, came upon all the landuntil the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And, about the ninth hour, Jesus uttered a cry, with a loud voice, sayingEloi! Eloi! lema sabachthanei? that is, My God! my God! to what end hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Now certain of them who were there standing, when they heard, began to sayThis man, calleth, Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And, straightway, one from among them, running, and taking a sponge, and filling it with vinegar and putting it on a reed, was giving him to drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>but, the rest, saidStay! let us see whether Elijah is coming, and will save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And, Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, dismissed the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And lo! the veil of the Temple, was rent, from top to bottom, into two; and, the earth, was shaken, and, the rocks, were rent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and, the tombs, were opened and, many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep, arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and, coming forth out of the tombs after his arising, entered into, the holy city, and plainly appeared unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now, the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things coming to pass, were violently affrighted, sayingTruly, Gods Son, was, he!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Now there were there, many women, from afar, beholding, who indeed had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary the Magdalene, also Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And, when, evening, arrived, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, whose name was Joseph, who also, himself, had been discipled unto Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>The same, going unto Pilate, claimed the body of Jesus. Then, Pilate commanded it to be given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph, taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean Indian-cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock, and, rolling near a large stone unto the door of the tomb, departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now there were there, Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>And, on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the High-priests and the Pharisee were gathered together unto Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>sayingSir! we have been put in mind that, that deceiver, said, while yet living,After three days, will I, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command, therefore, that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day,lest once the disciples should come and steal him, and say unto the people, He hath arisen from the dead! and, the last deception, shall be, worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate saith unto themYe have a guard: Go your way, secure it for yourselves, as ye know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>And, they, went and secured for themselves the sepulchre, sealing the stone, with the guard.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>And, late in the week, when it was on the point of dawning into the first of the week, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to view the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And lo! a great commotion occurred,for, a messenger of the Lord, descending out of heaven, and coming near, had rolled away the stone, and was sitting upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>Now his appearance, was, as lightning, and, his clothing, white as snow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>and, for fear of him, they who were keeping watch were thrown into a commotion, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the messenger, answering, said unto the womenBe not, ye, afraid! For I know that, Jesus the crucified, ye are seeking:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he hath arisen, as he said. Come! see the place where he lay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And, quickly going, tell his disciplesHe hath arisen from the dead, and lo! he is going before you into Galilee;There, shall ye yourselves see him: Lo! I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring tidings unto his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And lo! Jesus, met them, sayingJoy to you! And, they, going forward, held his feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then, Jesus saith unto themBe not afraid! Go your way, bear tidings unto my brethren, that they may depart into Galilee; and, there, shall they themselves see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now as they were, going, 1o! certain of the guard, went into the city and reported unto the High-priests all the things that had come to pass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>and, being gathered together with the Elders and taking counsel, sufficient pieces of silver, gave they unto the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>sayingSay ye, His disciples, coming, by night, stole him, while we were sleeping;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And, if this be reported unto the governor, we, will persuade him, and will make, you, free from care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>And, they, taking the pieces of silver, did as they were instructed. And this account was spread abroad among the Jewsuntil this  very  day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>And, the eleven disciples, went into Galilee, unto the mountain which, Jesus, had appointed them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>and, seeing him, they worshipped, but, some, doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus, coming near, spake unto them, sayingAll authority, in heaven and on earth, hath been given unto me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go ye, therefore, and disciple all the nations, Immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I myself have commanded you, And lo! I, am, with you, all the days, until the conclusion of the age.</verse>
