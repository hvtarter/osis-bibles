        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated unto the glad-message of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>Which he promised beforehand, through his prophets, in holy scriptures</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>Concerning his Son,who came to be of the seed of David, according to flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>Who was distinguished as the Son of Godby power, according to a Holy Spirit, through means of a resurrection of the dead,Jesus Christ our Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>Through whom we have received favour and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>Among whom are, ye also, called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>Unto all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints, favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, indeed, I give thanks unto my God, through Jesus Christ, concerning you all, because your faith is being announced throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is, my witness,unto whom I am rendering divine service in my spirit, in the glad message of his Son,how incessantly, I am making mention of you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>At all times in my prayers,making supplicationif, by some means, even now, at any time, I may have a way opened, in the will of God, to come unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift unto you, to the end ye may be established,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>That is to saythere may be a mutual encouragement among you, each by the others faith, both yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>I do not wish however that ye should be ignorant, brethren, that, many times, have I purposed to come unto you, but have been hindered, until the present,in order that, some fruit, I might have among you also, even as among the other nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>Both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, a debtor, I am:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>Thus, the eagerness on my partunto you also who are in Rome, to announce the joyful message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the joyful message; for it is Gods power unto salvation, to every one that believeth, both to Jew  first  and to Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For, a righteousness of God, is therein revealed,by faith unto faith: even as it is writtenBut, he that is righteous, by faith, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For there is being revealed an anger of God from heavenagainst all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who, the truth, in unrighteousness, do hold down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Inasmuch as, what may be known of God, is manifest among them, for, God, unto them, hath made it manifest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For, the unseen things of him, from a worlds creation, by the things made, being perceived, are clearly seen, even his eternal power and divinity,to the end they should be without excuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Inasmuch as, having come to know God, not, as God, did they glorify him, or give him thanks, but were made fruitless in their reasonings, and darkened was their undiscerning heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing to be wise, they were made foolish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And, exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God, for the likeness of an image of a corruptible man, and of birds and fourfooted beasts and reptiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Wherefore God gave them up in the covetings of their hearts unto impurity, so as to be dishonouring their bodies among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who, indeed, exchanged away the truth of God for the falsehood, and rendered worship and service unto the creature rather than unto the Creator,who is blessed unto the ages. Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this cause, God gave them up unto dishonourable passions; for, even their females, exchanged away the natural use into that which is against nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>In like manner also, even the males, leaving the natural use of the female, flamed out in their eager desire one for another, males with males, the indecency, effecting,and, the necessary recompence of their error, within themselves, duly receiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And, even as they did not approve to be holding, God, in acknowledgment, God gave them up unto a disapproved mind to be doing the things that are not becoming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>Filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, baseness, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil disposition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>Whisperers, detractors, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, vain boasters, inventors of vices, unto parents unyielding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>Without discernment, regardless of covenants, without natural affection, unmerciful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who, indeed, having acknowledged the righteous sentence of God,that, they who such things as these do practise, are worthy of death, not only, the same things, are doing, but are even delighting together with them who are practising</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore, inexcusable, thou art, O man, whoever judgest; for, wherein thou judgest some one else, thyself, thou dost condemn,for, the very things, thou dost practise, who art judging:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know, however, that, the sentence of God, is according to truth against them who, such things as these, do practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And reckonest thou this, O manwho dost judge them who such things do practise, and yet art doing the same, that, thou, shalt escape the sentence of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or, the riches of his kindness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, dost thou despise,not knowing that, the kindness of God, unto repentance, is leading thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But, according to thy hardness, and   impenitent heart, art treasuring up for thyself anger, in a day of anger and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>Who will render unto each one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>Unto them, on the one hand, who, by way of endurance in good work, are seeking, glory, honour and incorruption, life age-abiding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>Unto them, on the other hand, who are of contention, and are not yielding unto the truth, but are yielding unto unrighteousness, anger and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and anguishagainst every soul of man who worketh out what is base, both of Jew first and of Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory and honour and peaceunto every one who worketh what is good, both unto Jew first and unto Greek:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For, as many as without law sinned, without law, also shall perish, and, as many as within law sinned, through law, shall be judged;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For, not the hearers of law, are righteous with God, but, the doers of law, shall be declared righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For, whensoever the nations which have not law, by nature, the things of the law, may be doing, the same, not having law, unto themselves, are a law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>Who, indeed, shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience therewith bearing witness, and, between one another, their reasonings accusingor, even excusing, them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day on which God judgeth the secrets of men according to my glad-message through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>If, however, thou, art taking the name of Jew, and resting thyself upon law, and boasting in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>And art taking note of his will, and testing the things that differwhen receiving oral instruction out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>Art persuaded, moreover, that, thou thyself, arta guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>A trainer of the simple, a teacher of babes, having the forming of knowledge and truth in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou, therefore, that art teaching someone else, thyself, art thou not teaching? Thou that proclaimestDo not steal! Art thou, stealing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>That sayestDo not commit adultery! Art thou, committing adultery? That abhorrest sacrilege, Art thou, robbing temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>That in law dost boast, Through the transgression of the law, art thou dishonouring God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God, because of you, is defamed among the nations,even as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For, circumcision, indeed, profitethif, law, thou be practising; but, if thou be a transgressor of law, thy circumcision, hath become, uncircumcision</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If then, the uncircumcision, be guarding the righteous requirement of the law, shall not, his uncircumcision, as circumcision be reckoned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And the uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, shall judge, thee, who, notwithstanding letter and circumcision, art a transgressor of law!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For, not he who is one in appearance, is a Jew, nor is, that which is such in appearance in flesh, circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But, he who is one in secret, is a Jew,and,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What, then, is the preeminence of the Jew? Or what, the profit of his circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much, every way:First, indeed, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what? If some distrusted, shall their distrust make, the trust of God, void?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Far be it! But let, God, prove to be, true, albeit, every man, be false! Even as it is writtenThat thou mightest be declared righteous in thy words, and overcome when thou art in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But, if, our unrighteousness, commendeth, Gods righteousness, what shall we say? Surely, not unrighteous, is God who visiteth with his anger? After the manner of men, I am speaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Far be it! Else how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But, if, the truth of God, by my falsehood, hath the more abounded unto his glory, why, any longer, am, even I, as a sinner, to be judged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why not, according as we are injuriously charged,  and  according as some affirm that we say, Let us do the bad things, that the good ones may come? whose sentence is, just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? do we screen ourselves? Not at all! For we have before accused both Jews and Greeks of being, all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>Even as it is writtenthere is none righteous, not even one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that discerneth, There is none that seeketh out God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All, have turned aside, together, have become useless, There is none that doeth kindness, not so much as one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>A sepulchre opened, is their throat, with their tongues, have they used deceit, the poison of asps, is under their lips,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth, of cursing and bitterness, is full,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Swift, are their feet to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery, are in their ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And, the way of peace, have they not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that, whatsoever things the law saith, to them who are within the law, it speaketh, in order that, every mouth, may be stopped and all the world come, under penal sentence, unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Inasmuch as, by works of law, shall no flesh be declared righteous before him,through law, in fact, is discovery of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God hath been manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>A righteousness of God, through faith in  Jesus  Christ, unto all that have faith; for there is no distinction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For, all, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>Being declared righteous freely by his favour through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God hath set forth as a propitiatory covering, through faith in his blood, for a showing forth of his righteousness, by reason of the passing-by of the previously committed sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>In the forbearance of God,with a view to a showing forth of his righteousness in the present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous him that hath faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where, then, the boasting! It is excluded. Through what kind of law? Of works? Nay! but through a law of faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we reckon that a man is to be declared righteous by faith, apart from works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or,   the God, of Jews only, and not of the nations also? Yea! of the nations also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>If, at all events, God is one, who will declare righteousthe circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make, law, void through means of our faith? Far be it! On the contrary, law, we do establish!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we sayas touching Abraham our forefather?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For, if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath whereof to boast;nevertheless, not towards God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what doth the Scripture say? And Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now, unto him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned by way of favour but by way of obligation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>Whereas, unto him that worketh not but believeth on him that declareth righteous the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Just as David also affirmeth the happiness of the man unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Happy, they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Happy, the man whose sin the Lord will in nowise reckon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>This happiness, then,   for the circumcision, or for the uncircumcision? for we sayHis faith was reckoned unto Abraham as righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How, then, was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And, a sign, he received   of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while yet uncircumcised; to the end he might be father of all that believe during uncircumcision, to the end  the same  righteousness might be reckoned unto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And father of circumcisionunto them who are not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, while yet uncircumcised, of our father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For, not through means of law, doth the promise belong unto Abraham or unto his seed,that he should be heir of thee world; but, through a righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For, if they who are of law are heirs, made void is faith and of no effect is the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For, the law, worketh out anger, but, where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>For this cause, it is by faith, in order that it may be by way of favour, so that the promise is firm unto all the seed,not unto that by the law only, but unto that also</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>Even as it is writtenFather of many nations, have I appointed thee: before him whom he believedGod, who causeth the dead to live, and calleth the things that are not as things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who, past hope, upon hope believed, so that he became father of many nations,according to what had been saidSo shall be thy seed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And, without becoming weak in his faith, he attentively considered his own body, already deadenedhe being a hundred years old, the deadening also of Sarahs womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>In respect, however, of the promise of God, he was not led to hesitate by unbelief, but received power by his faith, giving glory unto God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And being fully persuaded (that),what he hath promised, able is he also to perform:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Wherefore  also , it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But for our sakes alsounto whom it is to be reckoned,even unto them that believe upon him who raised Jesus our Lord from among the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered up on account of our offences and was raised on account of the declaring us righteous.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Having, therefore, been declared righteous by faith, let us have, peace, towards God, through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>Through whom also we have had, our introduction,  by our faith  into this favour wherein we stand; and let us boast in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And, not only so, but let us boast also in our tribulations; knowing that, our tribulation, worketh out endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>And, our endurance, a testing, and, our testing, hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And, our hope, putteth not to shame. Because, the love of God, hath been poured out in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit that hath been given unto us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>Seeing that, Christ, we being weak as yet, seasonably, in behalf of such as were ungodly, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For, scarcely in behalf of a righteous man, will one die,in behalf of the good man indeed, peradventure one even dareth to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God commendeth his own love unto us in thatwe as yet being sinners, Christ in our behalf died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more, then, having now been declared righteous by his blood, shall we be saved through him from the anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For, if being enemies we were reconciled unto God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And, not only, so, but are even boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus  Christ ,through whom, now, the reconciliation we have received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>For this cause,just as, through one man, sin into the world entered, and through sin, death,and, so, unto all men death passed through, for that all had sinned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For, until law, sin was in the world, although sin is not reckoned when there is no law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet still, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression of Adam,who is a type of the Coming One;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But, not as the fault, so,  also  the decree of favour, for, if, by the fault of the one, the many died, much more, the favour of God and the free-gift in favour, by the one man Jesus Christ, unto the many superabounded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And, not as through one that sinned, is that which is freely given, for, the sentence of judgment, indeed, wasout of one   into condemnation, whereas, the decree of favour, isout of many faults, into a recovery of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For, if, by the fault of the one, death reigned through the one, much more, they who the superabundance of the favour and of  the free-gift of  the righteousness do receive, in life, shall reign through the one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Hence then, as through one fault,   is unto all men for righteous acquittal unto life;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Law, however, gained admission, in order that the fault might abound, but, where the sin abounded, the favour greatly superabounded:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What then shall we say? are we still to continue in sin that favour may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Far be it! we who have died unto sin, how, any longer, shall we live therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or know ye not that, we, as many as were immersed into Christ  Jesus , into his death were immersed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were, therefore, buried together with him through our immersion into his death, in order thatjust as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, so, we also, in newness of life should walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For, if we have come to be grown together in the likeness of his death, certainly, in that of his resurrection also, shall we be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Of this taking notethat, our old man, was crucified together with him in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we should, no longer, be in servitude to sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For, he that hath died, hath become righteously acquitted from his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Now, if we have died together with Christ, we believe that we shall also live together with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that, Christ having been raised from among the dead, no more dieth,death, over him, no more, hath lordship,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So, ye also, be reckoning yourselves to bedead indeed unto sin, but, alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin, therefore, reign in your death-doomed body, that ye should be obedient to its covetings;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law but under favour? Far be it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know ye not that, unto whom ye are presenting yourselves as servants for obedience, servants ye are unto   whom ye are obedient, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be unto God, thatwhereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient out of the heart unto the mould of teaching into which ye were delivered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And, being freed from sin, ye were made servants unto righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>In human fashion am I speaking, because of the weakness of your flesh;for, just as ye presented your members as servants unto impurity and unto lawlessness  for lawlessness , so now, present ye your members as servants unto righteousness for sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For, when ye were servants of sin, ye were free as to righteousness;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or are ye ignorant, brethren,for unto them that understand the law am I speaking, that, the law, hath lordship over a men as long as he liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For, the married woman, unto her living husband is bound by law; but, if her husband have died, she hath received a full release from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Hence then, her husband being alive, an adulteress, shall she be calledif she become another mans, but, if the husband have died, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she become another mans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So, then, my brethren, ye also, were made dead unto the law through the body of the Christ, to the end ye might become anothershis who from among the dead was raised, in order that we might bring forth fruit unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For, when we were in the flesh, the susceptibilities of sins which were through the law, used to be energized in our members unto the bringing forth of fruit unto death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But, now, we have received full release from the law, by dying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What, then, shall we say? Is the law sin? Far be it! On the contrary, I had not discovered, sin, save through law, for even, of coveting, I had not been aware if, the law, had not kept on sayingThou shall not covet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>Howbeit sin taking, occasionthrough the commandment, wrought out in me all manner of coveting; for, apart from law, sin is dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And, I, was alive, apart from law, at one time, but, the commandment coming, sin sprang up to life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>Whereas, I, died,and the commandment which was unto life was found by me to be, itself, unto death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For, sin,taking occasionthrough the commandment, completely deceived me and, through it, slew me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that, the law, indeed, is holy, and the commandment, holy, and righteous and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did, then, that which is good, unto me become death? Far be it! But</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that, the law, is spiritual,I, however, am a creature of flesh, sold under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For, that which I am working out, I do not approve,for not, what I wish, the same I practise, but, what I hate, the same I do:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now, if what I wish not, the same, I do, no longer am, I, working it out, but the, sin, that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>Hence, I find the law, to me who wish to be doing the right, that, unto me, the wrong lieth near:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>I have, in fact, a sympathetic pleasure in the law of God; according to the inner man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I behold a diverse law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and taking me captive in the law of sin which existeth in my members:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For, what was impossible by the law in that it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>In order that, the righteous requirement of the law, might be fulfilled in uswho, not according to flesh, do walk, but according to spirit;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But, ye, have not your being in flesh, but in spirit,if at least, Gods Spirit, dwelleth in you; and, if anyone hath not Christs Spirit, the same, is not his;</verse>
