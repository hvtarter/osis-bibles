        <title>And, this commandment, have we from him,that, he who loveth God, love, his brother also.</title>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The Elder, unto an elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not, I, alone, but all those also who understand the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the sake of the truth that abideth in us, and, with us, shall be unto times age-abiding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Favour, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced exceedingly, in that I had found, from among thy children, such as were walking in truth, even as, a commandment, we received from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And, now, I request thee, lady, not as writing, a new commandment, unto thee, but one which we were holding from the beginningThat we should be loving one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And, this, is love, that we should be walking according to his commandments: This, is, the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that, therein, ye should be walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>Because, many deceivers, have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh: This, is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Be taking heed unto yourselves, lest ye lose what things we earned,but, a full reward, ye may duly receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Every one that taketh a lead, and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not, God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same, hath, both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If anyone cometh unto you and, this teaching, doth not bring, be not receiving him home, and, Joy to thee! do not say;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For, he that biddeth him rejoice, hath fellowship with his wicked works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Though I had many things, unto you, to write, I was not minded   with paper and ink; but I hope to come unto you, and, mouth to mouth, to talk,that your joy may be made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thy chosen sister salute thee.</verse>
