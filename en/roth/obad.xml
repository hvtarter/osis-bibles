        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>Do not, then, look with satisfaction upon the day of thy brother, upon the day of his calamity, Neither rejoice over the sons of Judahin the day of their ruin,nor enlarge thy mouthin the day of distress:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>Do not enter into the gate of my peoplein the day of their misfortune, Do not, thou also, look with satisfaction on his miseryin the day of his misfortune; neither do thou thrust   on his substancein the day of his misfortune;</verse>
