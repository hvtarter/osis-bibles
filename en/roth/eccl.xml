        <title>Surely, the pressing of milk, bringeth forth curd, and, the pressing of the nose, bringeth forth blood, and, the pressing of wrath, bringeth forth strife.</title>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Proclaimer, son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>Vanity of vanities! saith the Proclaimer, vanity of vanities! all, is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit hath Man, in all his toil wherewith he toileth under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>Generation, goeth and, generation, cometh, but, the earth, unto times age-abiding, remaineth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>And the sun, breaketh forth, and the sun, goeth in,yea, unto his own place, he panteth, from whence he brake forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>Going unto the south, and circling unto the north,circling, circling continually, is, the wind, and, over its own circuits, returneth the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the streams, flow into the sea, yet, the sea, is not full,unto the place whither the streams flow, thither, do they again flow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All words, are weak, unable is any man to tell,not satisfied is the eye by seeing, nor filled is the ear with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which hath been, is the same that shall be, and, that which hath been done, is the same that shall be done,and there is, nothing new, under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there a thing, of which it can be said, See here, it is, new? Already, hath it been, for ages,   which was before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is, no remembrance, of the thing before,nor, even of the things after, which shall be, will there be any remembrance, with them who shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I, the Proclaimer, was king over Israel, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and to search out, wisely, concerning all things which are done under the heavens,the same, is the vexatious employment God hath given to the sons of men, to work toilsomely therein,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I saw all the works which were done under the sun,and lo! all, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>That which is crooked, cannot be straight,and, that which is wanting, cannot be reckoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>Spake, I, in my heart, saying, As for me, lo! I have become great, and have gathered wisdom, beyond any one who hath been before me over Jerusalem,and, my heart, hath seen much wisdom and knowledge:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>yea I have given my heart, to know wisdom, and to know madness, and folly,I know that, even this, is a feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For, in much wisdom, is much vexation,and, he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth pain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>Said, I, in my heart, Come now! I will prove thee with gladness, and look thou on blessedness,but lo! even that, was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>Of laughter, I said, Madness! and, of mirth, What can it do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought out with my heart, to cherish with wine, my flesh,but, my heart, was to guide with wisdom, even in laying hold of folly, until I should see which was blessedness for the sons of men, as to that which they could do, under the heavens, during the number of the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I enlarged my works,I built me houses, I planted me vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made me gardens, and parks,I planted in them trees of every kind of fruit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made me pools of water,to irrigate therefrom the thick-set saplings growing up into trees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I acquired, men-servants and women-servants, and, the children of the household, were mine,also possessions, herds and flocks in abundance, were mine, beyond all who had been before me in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I heaped me up, both silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings, and provinces,I provided me singing-men and singing-women, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I became great, and increased, more than any one who had been before me in Jerusalem,moreover, my wisdom, remained with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>and, nothing that mine eyes asked, withheld I from them,I did not keep back my heart from any gladness, for, my heart, obtained gladness out of all my toil, and so, this, was my portion, out of all my toil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>When, I, looked upon all my works, which my hands had made, and on my toil, whereon I had toilsomely wrought, then lo! all, was vanity, and feeding on wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>Thus turned, I, to look at wisdom, and madness and folly,for what can the man   that which, already, men have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then saw, I, that wisdom doth excel folly,as far as light excelleth darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>As for the wise man, his eyes, are in his head, whereas, the dullard, in darkness, doth walk,but, I myself, knew that, one destiny, happeneth to them, all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then said, I, in my heart, As it happeneth to the dullard, even to me, will it happen, but wherefore, then, became, I, wise to excess? Therefore spake I, in my heart, Even this, is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For there is no remembrance of a wise man, more than of a dullard, unto times age-abiding,seeing that, already, in the days to come, all hath been forgotten, how then cometh it that the wise man dieth equally with the dullard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life, for, a vexation unto me, was the work which was done under the sun,for, all, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>Therefore hated, I, all my toil, wherein I was toiling, under the sun,in that I should leave it for the man who should come after me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>and who could know whether a, wise man, he would be or a foolish, and yet he would lord it over all my toil, wherein I had toiled and wherein I had acted wisely, under the sun,even this, was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Then resolved I, to give my heart over to despair,concerning all the toil, wherein I had toiled, under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For here is a man, whose toil hath been with wisdom and with knowledge and with skill,yet, to a man who hath not toiled therein, shall he leave it as his portion, even this, was vanity and a great vexation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what hath the man for all his toil, and for the striving of his heart,wherein, he himself, toiled under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For, all his days, are pains, and, vexatious, is his employment, even in the night, his heart lieth not down,even this, was, vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>There was nothing more blessed for Man   that he should eat and drink, and see his desireth for blessedness in his toil,even this, saw, I myself, that, from the hand of God, it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who could eat and who could enjoy, so well as I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For, to a man who is good before him, hath he given wisdom and knowledge and gladness,whereas, to the sinner, he hath given employment, to gather and heap up, to give to one who is good before God, even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>For, every thing, there is a season,and a time for every pursuit, under the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to be born, and a time to die,A time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>A time to kill, and a time to heal,A time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>A time to weep, and a time to laugh,A time to wail, and a time to dance for joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>A time to cast away stones, and a time to heap up stones,A time to embrace, and a time to be far from loving embrace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>A time to seek, and a time to give up as lost,A time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>A time to rend, and a time to sew,A time to be silent, and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>A time to love and a time to hate,A time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein, himself, hath toiled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I looked at the employment which God hath given to the sons of men, to work therein:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>Everything, hath he made beautiful in its own time,also, intelligence, hath he put in their heart, without which men could not find out the work which God hath wrought, from the beginning even unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is no blessedness in them,save to be glad, and to do well with ones life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>Though indeed, that any man should eat and drink, and see blessedness, in all his toil, it is, the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know, that, whatsoever God doeth, the same, shall be age-abiding, unto it, there is nothing to add, and, from it, there is nothing to take away,and, God, hath done it, that men should stand in awe before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which was, already, had been, and, that which shall be, already, shall have been,but, God, seeketh that which hath been chased away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>Then, again, I saw under the sun, the place of justice, that there was lawlessness, and, the place of righteousness, that there was lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>Said, I, in my heart, Both the righteous and the lawless, will God judge,for   a time for every pursuit, and concerning every workthere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>Said, I, in my heart, as concerning the sons of men, That God was minded to prove them,and that they might see, that they were beasts, of themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For, as regardeth the destiny of the sons of men and the destiny of beasts, one fate, have they, as dieth the one, so, dieth the other, and, one spirit, have they all,and, the pre-eminence of man over beast, is nothing, for, all, were vanity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>all, go unto one place,all, came from the dust, and all, return to the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knoweth the spirit of the sons of men, whether it, ascendeth, above,or the spirit of the beast, whether it, descendeth, below, to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>So I saw, that there was nothing better than that a man should be glad in his works, for, that, is his portion,for who can bring him in, to look upon that which shall be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>Then again, I, considered all the oppressive deeds which were done under the sun,and lo! the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter, and, on the side of their oppressing, is power, and they have no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>So, I, pronounced happy the dead, who were, already, dead,more than the living, who were living, still;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>and, as better than both, him who had not yet come into being,who had not seen the vexatious work, which was done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Then saw, I, all the toil and all the skill of the work, that, for this, a man was envied of his neighbour,even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The dullard, claspeth his hands, and consumeth his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better a handfulwith quietness,than both hands, fullwith toil, and feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then again, I, looked at a vain thing under the sun:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>Here is one, without a second, even son or brother, he hath none, yet is there no end to all his toil, even his eye, is not satisfied with riches,neither   For whom, am I toiling, and letting my soul want good? Even this, was vanity, yea a vexatious employment, it was!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Better are two, than one,in that they have a good reward for their toil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For, if the one should fall,   would raise up his companion,but alas! for him who is alone when he falleth, with no second to raise him up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Moreover, if two lie together, then have they warmth,but how can, one, have warmth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>And, though an enemy should prevail against one, two, might make a stand before him,and, a threefold cord, cannot soon be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better a boy poor and wise,than a king, old and stupid, who knoweth not how to take warning any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For, out of prison, came he forth to reign, yea, even in his own kingdom, was he born poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I saw all the living, who were going hither and thither under the sun,  with the boy who was to be the second, who was to stand in the others place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There was no end to all the people, to all before whom he came, yet, they who should come later, would not rejoice in him,surely, even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Keep thy foot, when thou goest unto the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than dullards to offer sacrifice,for they make no acknowledgment of doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Be not rash with thy mouth, and, with thy heart, be not in haste to bring forth a word, before God,for, God, is in the heavens, and, thou, upon the earth, for this cause, let thy words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business,and, the voice of a dullard, is with a multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When thou vowest a vow unto God, do not defer to pay it, for there is no pleasure in dullards,what thou vowest, pay!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>Better that thou shouldest not vow,than vow, and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Do not let thy mouth cause thy flesh to sin,neither say thou, before the messenger, that it was, a mistake,wherefore should God be indignant at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For   amidst a multitude of dreams, and vanities, and many words,but, towards God, be thou reverent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If, the oppression of the poor, and the wresting of justice and righteousness, thou see in the province, do not be astonished over the matter,for, one high above the highest, is watching, yea, the Most High, is over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>And, the profit of the earth, is, for all,a king, by the field, is served.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver nor, he that loveth abundance, with revenue,-even this, was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When blessings are increased, increased are the eaters thereof,what profit, then, to the owner of them saving the sight of his eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>Sweet the sleep of the labourer, whether, little or much, he eat,but, the surfeit of the rich man, will not suffer him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>Here was an incurable evil, I had seen under the sun, riches kept by the owner thereof, to his hurt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>and those riches perish, by being ill employed,and though he begetteth a son, yet is there in his hand nothing at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came from his mothers womb, naked, he again departeth, as he came,and, nothing, can he take of his toil, which he can carry in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>Even this, moreover, is an incurable evil, altogether as he came, so, shall he depart,what profit then shall he have who toileth for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>Even all his days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Lo! what, I myself, have seenBetter that it should be excellent to eat and to drink and to see blessedness, in all ones toil wherein one toileth under the sun, for the number of the days of his life, in that God hath given it him, for, that, is his portion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>yet, as regardeth every man, to whom God hath given wealth and goods, and granted him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to find gladness in his toil, this, is, the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>Though it be not much, let him remember the days of his life,for, God, beareth witness, by the gladness of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>Here was an evil, I had seen under the sun,and it is, common, among men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>A man to whom God giveth riches and gains and honour, so that nothing doth he lack for his soulof all that he craveth, and yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but, a man unknown, eateth it,this, was vanity, and, an incurable evil, it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>Though a man should beget a hundred children, and live, many years, so that many should be the days of his years but, his own soul, should not be satisfied with the good, and he should not even have, a burial, I said, Better than he, is an untimely birth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>For, in vain, it came in, and, in darkness, it departeth,and, with darkness, its name, is covered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>even the sun, it never saw, nor aught did it know,more quietness, hath this than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Even though one hath lived a thousand years twice told, yet, good, hath he not seen,is it not, unto one place, that, all, are going?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the toil of man, is for his mouth,though, even the desire, is not satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what profit hath the wise man, over the dullard? What can, the poor man, knowso as to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better what the eyes behold, than the wandering of desire,even this, was vanity, and a feeding on wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>Whatsoever one may be, long ago, was he called by his name, and it is known that it isSon of Earth,he cannot, therefore, contend with one stronger than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>Seeing there are things in abundance which make vanity abound, what profit hath man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knoweth what is good for a man throughout his life, for the number of the days of his life of vanity, seeing he will make them, like a shadow,for who can tell a man, what shall be after him, under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>Better a name, than precious ointment,and the day of death, than the day of ones birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>Better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of banqueting, for, that, is the end of all men,and, the living, should take it to his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Better is grief than laughter,for, by the marring of the face, amended is the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise, is in the house of mourning, but, the heart of dullards, in the house of mirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>Better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for any man to hear the song of dullards,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For, a protection, is wisdom, and, a protection, is silver,but, the advantage of knowledge, is, that, wisdom, giveth life to the possessors thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>Everything, had I seen, in my days of vanity,Here was a righteous man, perishing in his righteousness, and there was a lawless man, continuing long in his wickedness.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is really a wise man, and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? The wisdom of a man, lighteth up his countenance, but, by defiance of countenance, one is disfigured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I   , The bidding of the king, observe thou, even out of regard to the oath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Not rashly from his presence, shouldst thou go: do not take thy stand in a vexatious thing,for, whatsoever he pleaseth, he will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>Where the word of a king is, there is power,who then may say to him, What wouldst thou do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>He that observeth the commandment, will not notice a vexatious thing,and, of time and manner, will the heart of the wise take note.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>For, to every pursuit, there is a time and a manner,when, the vexation of man, is great concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For there is no one who knoweth what shall be, for, when it shall be, who will tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>No man, hath power over the spirit, to retain the spirit, and, none, hath power over the day of death, and there is no furlough in war,neither shall lawlessness deliver them who are given thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this, had I seen, and tried to apply my heart to every work which was done under the sun,at such time as one man had power over another man, to his hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>And, thereupon, I considered the lawless when buried, when they had entered,   , that, from the place of the Holy One, they used to go and boast in the city that they had so done,even this, was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because sentence against a wicked work is not executed speedilyon this account, the heart of the sons of men is fully set within them, to commit wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner be committing wickedness a hundred times, and continuing long in his own way, yet I surely know that it shall be well to them who revere God, who stand in awe before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>but, well, shall it not be to the lawless man, neither shall he lengthen out his days like a shadow,because he standeth not in awe before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>Here was a vain thing which was done upon the earththat there were righteous men unto whom it happened according to the work of the lawless, and there were lawless men, unto whom it happened according to the work of the righteous,I said, that, even this, was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then extolled I, gladness, in that there was nothing better for a man, under the sun, than to eat and to drink, and to be glad,since, that, should tarry with him in his toil, for the days of his life which God had given him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I gave my heart, to know wisdom, and to consider the business that was done upon the earth, then surely, by day and by night, there was one who suffered not his eyes, to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>Then I considered all the work of God, that man could not find out the work that was done under the sun, inasmuch as man toileth in seeking and yet cannot find,yea, even though the wise man should say he knoweth, yet can he not find it out.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For, unto all this, I applied my heart, and, my heart, considered all this, that, the righteous and the wise and their servants, were in the hand of God,neither love nor hatred, could any man know, every one, was before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>Every one, was like every one else, one destiny, had the righteous and the lawless, the good and the pure and the impure, and he that sacrificed, and he that did not sacrifice,as the good man, so, the sinner, he that took an oath, as he who, of an oath, stood in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This was a misfortune in all that was done under the sun, that, one destiny, had they all,yea also, the heart of the sons of men, was full of wickedness, and, madness, was in their heart, while they lived, and, after that,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For, whosoever was united to all the living, for him, there was hope,-inasmuch as, a living dog, fared better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For, the living, knew that they should die,-but, the dead, knew not, anything, neither had they any longer a reward, because forgotten was their memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Both their love and their hatred and their envy, already had perished,and, portion, had they none any longer, unto times age-abiding, in aught that was done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go thy wayeat, with gladness, thy food, and drink, with a happy heart, thy wine,when already God is well pleased with thy works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Continually, let thy garments be white,and, ointment upon thy bead, let it not be lacking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Enjoy life, with thy wife whom thou lovest, all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity,for, that, is thy portion in life, and in thy toil wherewith, thou, art toiling under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, with thy might, do,for there is no work nor calculation nor knowledge nor wisdom, in hades, whither, thou, art going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I again saw under the sun, that not, to the swift, was the race, nor, to the strong, the battle, nay! nor, to the wise, food, nor yet, to the intelligent, riches, nor, even to the well-informed, comeliness,for, time and accident, happened to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For, indeed, man could not know his own time, like fishes which were caught in a cruel net, and like little birds which were caught in a trap,like them, were ensnared the sons of men, by a time of misfortune, when it fell upon them suddenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>Even this, had I seen of wisdom, under the sun,and, of great import, was the same unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>A little city, and men therein few,and there came against it a great king, and surrounded it, and built against it large siege-works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>but there was found therein, a man, poor   wise, and, he, delivered the city by his wisdom,yet, no one, remembered that poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then said, I, Better is wisdom than strength,although, the wisdom of the poor man, be despised, and, his words, not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise, in quietness, are heard,beyond the outcry of one who ruleth over dullards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Better is wisdom, than weapons of war,but, one sinner, may destroy much good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies, cause to stink   ferment, the oil of the perfumer,More costly than wisdom or honour, is a little folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>The sense of the wise, is on his right hand,But, the sense of the dullard, on his left:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Yea, even by the way, as the foolish man walketh along, his sense faileth himand he telleth everyone that, foolish, is he!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If, blunt, be the iron, and, himself, hath not sharpened, the edge, then, much force, must he apply,but, an advantage for giving success, is wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>If a serpent will bite, unless he is charmed, then there is nothing better for him that owneth a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise mans mouth, are pleasant,but, the lips of a dullard, will swallow him up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth, is folly,but, the latter end of his speech, is mischievous madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>Yet, a foolish man, multiplieth words,  no man knoweth that which hath been, and, that which shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The toil of dullards, shall weary a man, that he knoweth not how to go into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Alas! for thee, O land, when thy king is a boy,and, thy rulers, in the morning, do eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>How happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a son of nobles,and, thy rulers, in season, do eat, for strength, and not for debauchery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By two lazy arms, the framework sinketh in,and, by the hanging down of the hands, the house may leak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>Merrily people make bread, and, wine, gladdeneth life,but, money, answereth all things.</verse>
