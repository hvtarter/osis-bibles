      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <title>And, the command of Esther, confirmed the story of these Purim,and it was written in a book.</title>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>A man, there wasin the land of Uz, Job, his name,and that man was blameless and upright, and one who revered God, and avoided evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his substance wasseven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a body of servants exceeding large,thus was that man the greatest of all the sons of the East.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>Now his sons were wont to go, and make a banquet, at the house of each one upon his day,and to send and call their three sisters, to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And so it was, when the days of the banquet came round, that Job sent and hallowed them, and rising early in the morning offered ascending-sacrifices according to the number of them all; for Job said, Peradventure my sons have sinned, and have cursed God in their hearts. Thus and thus, was Job wont to do all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there came a certain day, when the sons of God entered in to present themselves unto Yahweh,so the accuser also entered, in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Whence comest thou? And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and wandering about therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Hast thou applied thy heart unto my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, one revering God and avoiding evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, Is it, for nought, that Job revereth God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not, thou thyself, made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? The work of his hands, thou hast blessed, and, his substance, hath broken forth in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But, in very deed, put forth, I pray thee, thy hand, and smite all that he hath,verily, unto thy face, will he curse thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Lo! all that he hath, is in thy hand, only, against himself, do not put forth thy hand. So the accuser went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there came a certain day,when his sons and his daughters were eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And, a messenger, came in unto Job, and said,The oxen, were plowing, and, the asses, feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>when the Sabeans swooped down, and took them, and, the young men, smote they with the edge of the sword,and escaped am, only I alone, too tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said,A fire of God, fell out of the heavens, and burned up the sheep and the young men, and consumed them; and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said, The Chaldeans, appointed three chiefs, and spread out against the camels, and took them, and, the young men, smote they with the edge of the sword; and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>Yet was this one speaking, when, another, came in and said,Thy sons and thy daughters, were eating, and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>when lo! a great wind, came from over the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died,and escaped am, only I alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell to the earth and worshipped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and saidNaked came I forth from the womb of my mother, and naked must I return thither, Yahweh, gave, and, Yahweh, hath taken away,The name of Yahweh be blessed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this, Job sinned not, nor imputed folly unto God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And there came a certain day when the sons of God entered in, to present themselves unto Yahwehso the accuser also entered in their midst, to present himself unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Whence comest thou? And the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from wandering about therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Hast thou applied thy heart unto my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, one who revereth God, and avoideth evil; and still he is holding fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>Then the accuser answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, and so, all that a man hath, will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>In very deed, put forth, I pray thee thy hand, and smite unto his bone, and unto his flesh,verily, unto thy face, will he curse thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Yahweh said unto the accuser, Behold him! in thy hand,only, his life, preserve thou!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So the accuser went forth from the presence of Yahweh,and smote Job with a sore boil, from the sole of his foot, unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a potsherd, to scrape himself therewith; he being seated in the midst of ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him, Art thou still holding fast thine integrity? Curse God, and die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>And he said unto her, As one of the base women speaketh, speakest thou? Blessing, shall we accept from God, and, misfortune, shall we not accept? In all this, Job sinned not with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when the three friends of Job heard of all this misfortune which had befallen him,they came, every man from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite,for they had by appointment met together to come to shew sympathy with him, and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And, when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and weptand rent, every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads, toward the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sat with him upon the ground, seven days and seven nights,and none was speaking unto him a word, for they saw that, exceeding great, was the stinging pain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this, opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>So then Job began, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Perish, the day wherein I was born, and the night it was said, Lo! a manchild!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>That day, be it darkness,Let not God enquire after it from above, May there shine upon it no clear beam:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and death-shade buy it back, May there settle down upon it a cloud, Let a days dark eclipse cause it terror:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>That night, darkness take it,May it not rejoice among the days of the year, Into the number of months, let it not enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo! that night, be it barren, Let no joyous shouting enter therein:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let day-cursers denounce it, Those skilled in rousing the dragon of the sky:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Darkened be the stars of its twilight,Let it wait for light, and there be none, neither let it see the eyelashes of the dawn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it closed not the doors of the womb wherein I was, and so hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Wherefore, in the womb, did I not die? From the womb, come forth and cease to breathe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>For what reason, were there prepared for meknees? and whybreasts, that I might suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>Surely, at once, had I lain down, and been quiet, I had fallen asleep, then, had I been at rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings, and counselors of the earth, who had built them pyramids:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with rulers possessing, gold,Who had filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or that, like an untimely birth hidden away, I had not come into being, like infants that never saw light:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There, the lawless, cease from raging, and there the toil-worn are at rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>At once are prisoners at peace, they hear not the voice of a driver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>Small and great, there, they are, and, the slave, is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore give, to the wretched, light? Or, life, to the embittered in soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, and it is not, And have digged for it, beyond hid treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice unto exultation, Are glad, when they can find the grave:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man, whose way is concealed, And GOD hath straitly enclosed him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For, in the face of my food, my sighing, cometh in, and, poured out like the water, are my groans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For, a dread, I dreaded, and it hath come upon me, and, that from which I shrank, hath overtaken me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not careless, nor was I secure, nor had I settled down,when there cameconsternation!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then responded Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one attempt a word unto thee, wilt thou be impatient? But, to restrain speech, who, can endure?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Lo! thou hast admonished many, and, slack hands, hast thou been wont to uphold:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Him that was stumbling, have thy words raised up, and, sinking knees, hast thou strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But, now, it cometh upon thee, and thou despairest, It smiteth even thee, and thou art dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not, thy reverence, thy confidence? And is not, thy hope, the very integrity of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who, being innocent, hath perished, or when, the upright, have been cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>So far as I have seen, They who plow for iniquity and sow misery, reap the same:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the blast of GOD, they perish, And, by the breath of his nostrils, are they consumed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>the roaring of the lion, and the noise of the howling lion, yet, the teeth of the fierce lions, are broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The strong lion perishing for lack of prey, Even the whelps of the lioness, are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>But, unto me, something was brought by stealth,and mine ear caught a whispering of the same:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>When there were thoughts, from visions of the night,When deep sleep falleth upon men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Dread, came upon me, and trembling, The multitude of my bones, it put in dread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then, a spirit, over my face, floated along, The hair of my flesh bristled-up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not distinguish its appearance, I looked, but there was no form before mine eyes,A whispering voice, I heard:-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall, mortal man, be more just than GOD? Or a man be more pure than, his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Lo! in his own servants, he trusteth not, and, his own messengers, he chargeth with error:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more the dwellers in houses of clay, which, in the dust, have their foundation, which are crushed sooner than a moth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Betwixt morning and evening, are they broken in pieces, With none to save, they utterly perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent-rope within them, torn away? They die, disrobed of wisdom!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call, I pray theeis there one to answer thee? Or, to which of the holy ones, wilt thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For, to the foolish man, death is caused by vexation, and, the simple one, is slain by jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I, have seen the foolish taking root, and then hath his home decayed, in a moment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far removed from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, and there is none to deliver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest, the hungry, eateth up, and, even out of thorn hedges, he taketh it, and the snare gapeth for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For sorrow, cometh not forth out of the dust,nor, out of the ground, sprouteth trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>Though, man, to trouble, were born, as, sparks, on high, do soar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>Yet indeed, I, would seek unto El, and, unto Elohim, would I set forth any cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doeth great things, beyond all search,Wondrous things, till they cannot be recounted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain, upon the face of the earth, and sendeth forth waters, over the face of the open fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>Setting the lowly on high, and, mourners, are uplifted to safety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>Who doth frustrate the schemes of the crafty, that their hands cannot achieve abiding success;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>Who captureth the wise in their own craftiness, yea the headlong counsel of the crooked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>By day, they encounter darkness, and, as though it were night, they grope at high noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saveth from the sword, out of their mouth, and, out of the hand of the strong, the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>Thus to the poor hath come hope, and, perversity, hath shut her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Lo! how happy is the man whom God correcteth! Therefore, the chastening of the Almighty, do not thou refuse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For, he, woundeth that he may bind up, He smiteth through, that, his own hands, may heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>In six troubles, he will rescue thee, and, in seven, there shall smite thee no misfortune:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine, he will ransom thee from death, and in battle from the power of the sword;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>During the scourge of the tongue, shalt thou be hid, neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and at hunger, shalt thou laugh, and, of the wild beast of the earth, be not thou afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For, with the stones of the field, shall be thy covenant, and, the wild beast of the field, hath been made thy friend;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that, at peace, is thy tent, and shalt visit thy fold, and miss nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>And thou shalt know, that numerous is thy seed, and, thine offspring, like the young shoots of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come, yet robust, to the grave, as a stack of sheaves mounteth up in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo! as for this, we have searched it outso, it is, Hear it, and know, thou, for thyself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then responded Job, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that, weighed, were my vexation, and, my engulfing ruininto the balances, they would lift up all at once!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For, now, beyond the sand of the seas, would it be heavy, On this account, my words, have wandered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For, the arrows of the Almighty, are in me, The heat whereof, my spirit is drinking up, The, terrors of GOD, array themselves against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray over grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul hath refused to touch, Those things, are like disease in my food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that my request would come! and, my hope, oh that GOD would grant!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>That it would please GOD to crush me, That he would set free his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>So might it still be my comfort, And I might exult in the anguish he would not spare,That I had not concealed the sayings of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should hope? Or what mine end, that I should prolong my desire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength, the strength of stones? Or is, my flesh, of bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is there any help at all in me? Is not, abiding success, driven from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>The despairing, from his friend, should have lovingkindness, or, the reverence of the Almighty, he may forsake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>Mine own brethren, have proved treacherous like a torrent, like a channel of torrents which disappear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which darken by reason of the cold, over them, is a covering made by the snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>By the time they begin to thaw, they are dried up, as soon as it is warm, they have vanished out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>Caravans turn aside by their course, they go up into a waste, and are lost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked about, the travelling companies of Sheba, hoped for them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They are ashamed that they had trusted, They have come up to one of them, and are confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For, now, ye have come to him, ye see something fearful, and fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Is it that I said, Make me a gift, or, out of your abundance, offer a bribe on my behalf;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>And deliver me from the hand of the adversary? And, out of the hand of tyrants, ransom me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Show me, and, I, will hold my peace, And, wherein I have erred, cause me to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How pleasant are the sayings that are right! But what can a decision from you, decide?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>To decide words, do ye intend, When, to the wind, are spoken the sayings of one in despair?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Surely, the fatherless, ye would assail, and make merchandise of your friend!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>But, now, be pleased to turn to me, that it may be, to your faces, if I speak falsehood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Reply, I pray you, let there be no perversity, Yea reply even yet, my vindication is in it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there, in my tongue, perversity? Or can, my sense, not discern, engulfing ruin?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As, a bondman, panteth for the shadow, and as, a hireling, longeth for his wage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>So, have I been made to inherit months of calamity, and, nights of weariness, have been appointed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>As soon as I lie down, I say, When shall I arise? yet he lengtheneth out the evening, and I am wearied with tossings until the breeze of twilight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and a coating of dust, My skin, hath hardened, and then run afresh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days, are swifter than a weavers shuttle, and they are spent, without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>Remember thou, that, a wind, is my life, not again shall mine eye see blessing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>Nor shall see methe eye that used to behold me, Thine eyes, are upon me, and I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>A cloud faileth, and is gone, So, he that descendeth to hades, shall not come up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.10'>He shall not return again to his house, and his own place shall be acquainted with him no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.11'>I also, cannot restrain my mouth,I must speak, in the anguish of my spirit, I must find utterance, in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.12'>Am, I, a sea, or a sea-monster,That thou shouldst set over me a watch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.13'>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall help to carry my complaint,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.14'>Then thou scarest me with dreams, and, by visions, dost thou terrify me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.15'>So that my soul chooseth strangling, Death, rather than   my bones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.16'>I am wasted away, Not, to times age-abiding, can I live, Let me alone, for, a breath, are my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.17'>What is a mortal, that thou shouldst nurture him? Or that thou shouldst fix upon him thy mind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.18'>That thou shouldst inspect him morning by morning, moment by moment, shouldst test him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.19'>How long wilt thou not look away from me? Wilt thou not let me alone, till I can swallow my spittle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.20'>I have sinned, What can I do for thee, thou watcher of men? Wherefore hast thou set me as thine object of attack, or have I become, unto thee, a burden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.21'>And why wilt thou not remove my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For, now, in the dust, should I lie down, and thou shouldst seek me diligently, and I should not be.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.8'>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.1'>Then responded Bildad the Shuhite, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.2'>How long wilt thou speak these things? Or, as a mighty wind, shall be the sayings of thy mouth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.3'>Should, GOD, pervert justice? Or, the Almighty, pervert righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.4'>Though, thy children, sinned against him, and he delivered them into the hand of their transgression,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.5'>Yet, if, thou thyself, wilt diligently seek unto GOD,and, unto the Almighty, wilt make supplication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.6'>If, pure and upright, thou thyself, art, surely, now, will he answer thy prayer, and will prosper thy righteous habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.7'>So shall thy beginning appear small,when, thy latter end, he shall greatly increase!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.8'>For inquire, I pray thee, of a former generation, and prepare thyself for the research of their fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.9'>For, of yesterday, are, we, and cannot know, for, a shadow, are our days upon earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.10'>Shall, they, not teach theetell thee, and, out of their memory, bring forth words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.11'>Can the paper-reed grow up, without a marsh? Or the rush grow up, without water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.12'>Though while still, in its freshness, it be not plucked off, yet, before any kind of grass, it doth wither:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.13'>So, shall be the latter end of all who forget GOD, and, the hope of the impious, shall perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.14'>Whose trust shall be contemptible,and, a spiders web, his confidence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.15'>He leaneth upon his house, and it will not stand, he holdeth it fast, and it will not remain erect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.16'>Full of moisture he is, before the sun, and, over his garden, his shoot goeth forth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.17'>Over a heap, his roots are entwined, a place of stones, he descrieth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.18'>If one destroy him out of his place, then will it disown him   I have not seen thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.19'>Lo! that, is the joy of his way,and, out of the dust, shall others spring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.20'>Lo! GOD, will not reject a blameless man, neither will he grasp the hand of evil-doers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.21'>At length he shall fill with laughter thy mouth, and thy lips, with a shout of triumph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.8.22'>They who hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, but, the tent of the lawless, shall not be!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.9'>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.1'>Then responded Job, and said</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.2'>Of a truth, I know that so it is, But how can a mortal be just with GOD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.3'>If he choose to contend with him, he cannot answer him, one of a thousand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.4'>Wise in heart, and alert in vigour, What man hath hardened himself against him, and prospered!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.5'>Who removeth mountains, unawares, Who overturneth them in his anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.6'>Who shaketh the earth, out of its place, and, the pillars thereof, shudder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.7'>Who commandeth the sun, and it breaketh not forth, and, about the stars, he putteth a seal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.8'>Who spreadeth out fire heavens, by himself alone! and marcheth along, on the heights of the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.9'>Who made the Bear, the Giant and the Cluster, and the chambers of the south;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.10'>Who doeth great things, past finding out, and marvels, beyond number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.11'>Lo! he cometh upon me, yet can I not see him, Yea he passeth on, yet can I not discern him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.12'>Lo! he snatcheth away, who can bring it back? Who shall say unto him, What wouldst thou do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.13'>As for GOD, if he withdraw not his anger, under him, will have submitted themselvesthe proud helpers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.14'>How much less that, I, should answer him, should choose my words with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.15'>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, to be absolved, I would make supplication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.16'>Though I had called, and he had answered me, I could not believe, that he would lend an ear to my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.17'>For, with a tempest, would he fall upon me, and would multiply my wounds without need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.18'>He would not suffer me to recover my breath, for he would surfeit me with bitter things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.19'>If it regardeth vigour, bold is he! If justice, who could summon him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.20'>If I should justify myself, mine own mouth, would condemn me,I blameless? then had it shewn me perverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.21'>I blameless? I should not know my own soul, I should despise my own life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.22'>One thing, there is, for which cause, I have said it, The blameless and the lawless, he bringeth to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.23'>If, a scourge, slay suddenly, at the despair of innocent ones, he mocketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.24'>The earth, hath been given into the hand of a lawless one, The faces of her judges, he covereth, If not, then who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.25'>My days, therefore, are swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have seen no good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.26'>They have passed away with boats of paper-reed, like a vulture   rusheth upon food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.27'>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will lay aside my sad countenance, and brighten up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.28'>I am afraid of all my pains, I know, that thou wilt not pronounce me innocent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.29'>I, shall be held guilty,Wherefore then, in vain, should I toil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.30'>Though I bathe myself in snow water, and cleanse, in cleanness itself, my hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.31'>Then, in a ditch, wouldst thou plunge me, and mine own clothes should abhor me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.32'>For he is not a man like myself, whom I might answer, nor could we come together into judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.33'>There is not, between us, a mediator, who might lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.34'>Let him take from off me his rod, and, his terror, let it not startle me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.9.35'>I could speak, and not be afraid of him, although, not so, am, I, in myself!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.10.3'>Is it seemly in thee, that thou shouldst oppress? that thou shouldst despise the labour of thine own hand, when, upon the counsel of the lawless, thou hast shone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.4'>Eyes of flesh, hast thou? or, as a mortal seeth, seest thou?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.10.6'>That thou shouldst seek for mine iniquity, and, for my sin, shouldst make search:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.10.8'>Thine own hands, shaped me, and made me, all in unison round about, and yet thou hast confounded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.9'>Remember, I pray thee, that, as clay, thou didst make me, and, unto dust, thou wilt cause me to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.10'>Didst thou not, like milk, pour me forth? and, as cheese, curdle me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.11'>With skin and flesh, clothe me? and, with bones and sinews, interweave me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.12'>Life and lovingkindness, thou didst bestow upon me,and, thy watchful care, preserved my breath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.13'>Yet, these things, thou didst hide in thy heart, I know that, this, hath been with thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.14'>If I have sinned, then couldst thou watch me, and, from mine iniquity, thou wouldst not acquit me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.15'>If I have been lawless, alas for me! Or, if I am righteous, I will not lift up my head, Surfeited with shame, look thou then on my humiliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.16'>When it is lifted up, like a howling lion, thou dost hunt me, Then again thou dost shew thyself marvellous against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.17'>Thou renewest thy witnesses before me, and dost increase thy vexation with me, Relaysyea an army, is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.18'>Wherefore then, from the womb, didst thou bring me forth? I might have breathed my last, and, no eye, have seen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.10.19'>As though I had not been, should I have become,from the womb to the grave, might I have been borne.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.40'>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.1'>And Yahweh responded to Job, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.2'>Shall a reprover contend, with the Almighty? He that disputeth with GOD, let him answer it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.3'>Then Job responded to Yahweh, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.4'>Lo! I am of no account, what shall I reply to thee? My hand, have I laid on my mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.5'>Once, have I spoken, but I will not proceed, yea twice, but I will not add.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.6'>So then Yahweh responded to Job, out of a storm, and said:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.40.18'>His bones, are barrels of bronze, his frame, is like hammered bars of iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.19'>He, is the beginning of the ways of GOD, Let his maker, present him his sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.20'>Surely the mountains bring, produce, to him, where, all the wild beasts of the field, do play;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.21'>Under the lotus-trees, he lieth down, in a covert of reed and swamp;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job responded to Yahweh, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that, all things, thou canst do, and that no purpose can be withholden from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is it that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore, have I declared, but not understood, things too wonderful for me, which I could not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear thou, I pray thee, and, I, will speak, I will ask thee, and inform thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>By the hearing of the ear, had I heard thee, but, now, mine own eye, hath seen thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>For this cause, I tremble and repent, on dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it came to pass, after Yahweh had spoken these words unto Job, that Yahweh, said unto Eliphaz the Temanite, Kindled is mine anger against thee and against thy two friends, for ye have not spoken concerning me the thing that is right, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now, therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go unto my servant Job, and ye shall offer up an ascending-sacrifice in your own behalf, and, Job my servant, shall pray over you,for, him, will I accept, that I may not deal out to you disgrace, because ye have not spoken concerning me the thing that is right, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And, Yahweh himself, turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed in behalf of his friends,and Yahweh increased all that Job had possessed, unto twice as much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came unto him all his brethren and all his sisters, and all his former acquaintances, and they did eat bread with him in his house,and shewed sympathy with him and comforted him, over all the calamity which Yahweh had brought upon him,and they gave him, every one a weight of money, and every one, a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And, Yahweh, blessed the latter end of Job, more than his beginning,and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>And he came to have seven sons, and three daughters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>and he called the name of the first Jemima, and the name of the second Kezia,and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And there were found no women so fair as the daughters of Job, in all the land,and their father gave them an inheritance, in the midst of their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And Job lived, after this, a hundred and forty years,and saw his sons and his sons sons, four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, old and satisfied with days.</verse>
