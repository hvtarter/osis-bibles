        <title>For, even our God, is a consuming fire.</title>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James, a servant, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,unto the twelve tribes that are in the dispersion, Wishes joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>All Joy, account it, my brethren, whensoever ye fall in with, manifold, temptations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>Taking note, that, the proving of your faith, worketh out endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>But let, your endurance, have, mature work, that ye may be mature and complete, in nothing, coming short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>But, if any of you is sinning short of wisdom, let him be asking of God, Who giveth unto all freely and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him be asking in faith, nothing, doubting, for, he that doubteth, is like a wave of the sea, wind-driven and storm-tossed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A two-souled man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>But boasting be the lowly brother in his uplifting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>Whereas the rich, in his being brought low,because, as a flower of grass, he will pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun hath sprung up, with it scorching heat, and hath withered the grass, and, the flower thereof, hath fallen out, and, the beauty of the face thereof, hath perished,so, also the rich, in his goings, shall languish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Happy the man who endureth temptation! Because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of lifewhich he hath promised unto them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let, no one, while tempted, be sayingFrom God, am I tempted,for, God, cannot be tempted by things evil, and, himself, tempteth no one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But, each one, is tempted, when, by his own coveting, he is drawn out and enticed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then, the coveting, having conceived, giveth birth to sin, and, the sin, when full-grown, bringeth forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Be not deceived, my brethren beloved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>Every good giving, and every perfect gift, is, from above, coming down from the Father of lightswith whom is no alternation, nor shadow cast, by turning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Because he was so minded, he hath brought us forth with a word of truth, to the end we should be a sort of firstfruit of his creatures</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>Ye know, my brethren beloved,but let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>For, mans anger, worketh not, Gods righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Wherefore, putting away all filthiness and overflow of baseness, in meekness, welcome ye the word fitted for inward growth, which is able to save your souls:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>Become ye doers of the word, and not hearers onlyreasoning yourselves astray;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>Because, if any is, a word-hearer, and not a doer, the same, is like unto a man observing his natural face in a mirror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>For he observed himself, and is gone away, and, straightway, it hath escaped him,what manner of man, he was!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But, he that hath obtained a nearer view into the perfect law of liberty, and hath taken up his abode by it, becomingnot a forgetful hearer, but a work doer, the same, happy in his doing, shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any thinketh he is observant of religion, not curbing his own tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this ones, religious observance is, vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Religious observance, pure and undefiled with our God and Father, is, thisto be visiting orphans and widows in their affliction, unspotted, to keep, himself, from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, do not, with respect for persons, be holding the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,   of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For, if there enter into your synagogue a man wearing gold rings in gay clothing, and there enter a destitute man also, in soiled clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>And ye eye him that hath on the gay clothing, and say, Thou, be sitting here, pleasantly,and, unto the destitute man, sayThou, stand, or sit there under my footstool,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Would ye not have been led to make distinctions among yourselves, and have become judges with wicked reasonings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken! my brethren beloved:Hath not, God, chosen the destitute in the world   rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>Whereas, ye, have dishonoured the destitute man! Do not, the rich, oppress you? and, themselves, drag you into courts of justice?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do not, they, defame the noble name which hath been invoked upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If ye are, indeed, fulfilling, a royal law, according to the scriptureThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, nobly, are ye doing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But, if ye are shewing respect of persons, sin, are ye working, being convicted by the law as transgressors!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For, a man who shall keep, the whole law, but shall stumble in one thing, hath become, for all things, liable,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For, he that hath saidDo not commit adultery, hath also saidDo not commit murder,now, if thou dost not commit adultery, but dost commit murder, thou hast become a transgressor of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So, be speaking, and, so, doing, as they who, through means of a law of freedom, are about to be judged;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For, the judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What profit, my brethren,if one should be saying he hath, faith, but hath not, works; can his faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If, a brother or sister, should be naked, and coming short of the daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>And one from among you should say unto themWithdraw in peace, be getting warmed and fed, but should not give them the things needful for the body, What the profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>So, also, faith, if it have not works, is dead, by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But one will say,Thou, hast faith, and, I, have works, show me thy faith apart from thy works, and, I, unto thee, will shew, by my works, my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>Thou believest that God is, one: thou doest, wellEven the demons believe, and shudder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But art thou willing to learn, O empty man! that, faith, apart from works, is, idle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Abraham our father, was it not, by works, he was declared righteouswhen he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Thou seest that, his faith, had been working together with his works, and by his works did his faith become full-grown,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And the scripture was fulfilled which saithAnd Abraham believed God, And it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and, Gods friend, was he called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>Ye see thatby works, a man is declared righteous, and not by faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>And, in like manner also, Rahab the harlot, Was it not, by works, she was declared righteous, when she gave welcome unto the messengers, and, by another way, urged them forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>Just as, the body, apart from spirit, is dead, so, our faith also, apart from works, is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>Not, many teachers, become ye, my brethren, knowing that, a severer sentence, shall ye receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For, oft, are we stumbling, one and all: If anyone, in word, doth not stumble, the same, is a mature man, able to curb even the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Now, if, the horses bits, into their mouths, we thrust, to the end they may be yielding to us, their whole body also, do we turn about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Lo! the ships also, large as they are, and, by rough winds, driven along, are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the steersman inclineth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>So, also, the tongue, is, a little member, and yet, of great things, maketh boast. Lo! how small a fire, kindleth, how great a forest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And, the tongue, is a fire,  , the world of unrighteousness, the tongue, becometh fixed among our members, that which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the wheel of our natural life, and is set on fire, by gehenna!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For, every natureboth of wild beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and of things in the sea, is to be tamed, and hath been tamed, by the human nature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But, the tongue, none of mankind can, tame,A restless mischief! Full of deadly poison</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>Therewith, are we blessing our Lord and Father, and, therewith, we are cursing the men who, after the likeness of God, have been brought into being!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth, come forth blessing and cursing! Not meet, my brethren, for, these things, thus, to be coming to pass!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Doth, the fountain, out of the same opening, teem forth the sweet and the bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Is it possible, my brethren, for, a fig-tree, to produce, olives, or, a vine, figs? Neither can, salt, water yield, sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and well-instructed-among you? Let him show, out of his comely behaviour, his works, in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But, if, bitter jealousy, ye have, and rivalry, in your hearts; be not boasting and showing yourselves false against the truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom is not one, from above, coming down, but is earthly, born of the soul, demoniacal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For, where jealousy and rivalry are, there, are anarchy and every ignoble deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But, the wisdom from above, isfirst pure, then peaceable, reasonable, easy to be entreated, fraught with mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>And, in harvest of righteousness, with peace, is sown by them that make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>Whence wars and whence fightings among you? are they not from hencedue to your pleasures which are taking the field in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>Ye covetand have not, ye commit murder, and are jealousand cannot obtain,ye fight and war. Ye have notbecause ye do not really ask,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>Ye ask and receive not, because that, basely, ye ask, in order that, in your pleasures, ye may spend   .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Adulteresses! Know ye not that, the friendship of the world, is, enmity to God? Whosoever, therefore, is minded to be, a friend, of the world, an enemy of God, doth constitute himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Or think ye that, in vain, the scripture speaketh? Is it, for envying, that the spirit which hath taken an abode within us doth crave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>Howbeit he giveth, greater, favour. Wherefore it saithGod, against the haughty, arrayeth himself, Whereas, unto the lowly, he giveth favour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Range yourselves, therefore, under God, but withstand the adversary, and he will flee from you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near unto God, and he will draw near unto you. Cleanse hands, sinners! Chasten hearts, double souls!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be miserable and lament and weep, let, your laughter, into lamentation, be turned, and, your joy, into dejection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Be made low in presence of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Be not speaking one against another, brethren! He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against law, and judgeth law; Now, if, upon law, thou art passing judgment, thou art not a doer of law, but a judge!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>One, is Lawgiver and JudgeHe who hath power to save and to destroy; but who art, thou, that judgest thy neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come now! ye that sayToday or To-morrow, we will journey unto this city here, and will spend there a year, and will trade and get gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>Men who are not versed in the morrowof what sort your life   ; for ye are, a vapourfor a little, appearing, then, just disappearing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead of your sayingIf, the Lord, be pleased, we shall both, live and do this or that;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>Whereas, now, are ye boasting in your pretensions:All boasting like this, is, wicked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>To him, therefore, who knoweth how to be doing, a right thing, and is not doing it, it is, sin, unto him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Come now! ye wealthy! Weep ye, howling, for your hardships which are coming upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your wealth, hath rotted, and, your garments, have become, moth-eaten,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver, have rusted away, and, their rust, shall be, witness against you, and shall eat your flesh, as fire! Ye have laid up treasure in days of extremity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Lo, the wage of the workers who have out down your fieldsthat which hath been kept back, by you, is crying out; and, the outcries of them who reaped, into the ears of the Lord of hosts, have entered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>Ye have luxuriated upon the land, and run riot, ye have pampered your hearts in a day of slaughter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>Ye sentencedye murdered the Righteous one! Is he not arraying himself against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the Presence of the Lord:Lo! the husbandman, awaiteth the precious fruit of the earth, having patience for it, until it receive the early and the latter rain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be, ye also, patient, Stablish your hearts, because, the Presence of the Lord, hath drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Be not sighing, brethren, one against another, lest ye be judged,Lo! the Judge, before the doors, is standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>An example, take ye, brethren, of distress and patience,the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Lo! we pronounce them happy who have endured;Of the endurance of Job, ye have heard, and, the end of the Lord, have ye seen,that, of much tender affection, is the Lord, and full of compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But, before all things, my brethren, do not swear,either by heaven, or by the earth, or by any other oath; but let your Yea be yea, and your Nay nay,lest, under judgment, ye fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>In distress, is any among you? Let him pray; Cheerful, is any? Let him strike the strings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Sick, is any among you? Let him call unto him the elders of the assembly, and let them pray for him, anointing him with oil in the name  of the Lord ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And, the prayer of faith, shall save the exhausted one, and the Lord will raise him up, and, if he have committed, sins, it shall be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Be openly confessing, therefore, one to another, your sins, and be praying in each others behalf,that ye may be healed. Much availeth, the supplication of a righteous man, when it is energised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah, was, a man, affected like us; and he earnestly prayed that there might be no moisture, and there was no moisture on the land, for three years and six months,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And, again, he prayed, and, the heaven, gave, rain, and, the land, shot up her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brethren! If one among you be led to err from the truth, and one turn him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>Be ye taking notethat, he that turneth back a sinner out of the error of his waywill save his soul out of death, and hide a multitude of sins.</verse>
