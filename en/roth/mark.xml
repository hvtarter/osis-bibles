      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <title>And, they, went and secured for themselves the sepulchre, sealing the stone, with the guard.</title>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>Beginning of the glad-message of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>According as it is written in Isaiah the prophetLo! I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A voice of one crying aloudIn the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, straight, be making his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John the Immerser came, in the wilderness, proclaiming an immersion of repentance for remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>and there were going out unto him all the Judaea country and all they of Jerusalem, and were being immersed by him in the Jordan river, openly confessing their sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>and John was clothed with camels-hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and was eating locusts and wild honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>and he proclaimed, sayingHe that is mightier than I cometh after  me , of whom I am not worthy to stoop and unloose the strap of his sandals:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I, have immersed you, with water,He, will immerse you, with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass, in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed into the Jordan by John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And, straightway, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rending asunder, and, the Spirit, as a dove, descending unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and a voice  came  out of the heavensThou, art my Son, the Beloved,In thee, I delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And, straightway, the Spirit urgeth him forth into the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>and he was in the wilderness, forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts,and, the messengers, were ministering unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the glad-message of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'> and saying The season is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God hath drawn near,Repent ye, and have faith in the glad-message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And, passing by near the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea,for they were fishers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>and Jesus said unto themCome after me, and I will make you become fishers of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>and, straightway, leaving the nets, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And, going forward a little, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, and them who were in the boat putting in order the nets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>and, straightway, he called them,and, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat, with the hired men, they came away after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they journey into Capernaum. And, straightway, on the Sabbath, entering into the synagogue, he began teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>and they were being struck with astonishment at his teaching,for he was teaching them as one having authority, and, not as the Scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And, straightway, there was in their synagogue, a man in an impure spirit,and he cried out aloud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>sayingWhat have we in common with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee, who thou art, The Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him,  saying Be silenced, and come forth out of him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the impure spirit, tearing him, and calling out with a loud voice, came forth out of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>and they were amazed, one and all, so that they began to discuss among themselves, sayingWhat is this? New teaching! With authority, to the impure spirits also, he giveth orders, and they obey him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And forth went the report of him, straightway, on every hand, into the surrounding country of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And, straightway, out of the synagogue, going forth, he went unto the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now, the mother-in-law of Simon, was lying in a fever, and, straightway, they speak to him concerning her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>and, coming near, he raised her up, grasping her hand,and the fever left her, and she began ministering unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And, evening arriving, when the sun went in, they were bearing unto him all who were sick, and them who were demonized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and all the city was gathered unto the door;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>and he cured many that were sick with divers diseases, and, many demons, he cast out, and suffered not the demons to be talking,because they knew him  to be Christ .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And, very early by night arising, he went out  and departed  into a desert place, and, there, was praying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>and Simon, and they who were with him, went in quest of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and found him, and say unto himAll, are seeking thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>and he saith unto themLet us be going elsewhere, into the neighbouring country-towns, in order that, there also, I may be making proclamation,for, to this end, came I forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>and he came, making proclamation, into their synagogues, throughout the whole of Galilee,and, was casting the demons out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there cometh unto him, a leper, beseeching him and  kneeling ,saying unto himIf thou be willing, thou canst cleanse me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>and, moved with compassion, he stretched forth the hand, and touched him, and saith unto himI am willing, Be cleansed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>and, straightway, the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>and, strictly charging him, straightway, he urged him forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and saith unto himMind! unto no one, say aught,but withdraw, thyself, show unto the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what things Moses enjoined, for a witness unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But, he, going forth, began to be proclaiming many things, and blazing abroad the story, so that, no longer, was it possible for him, openly, into a city, to enter,but, outside, in desert places,  was he , and they were coming unto him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And, entering again into Capernaum, after some days, it was heard sayHe is in a house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and many were gathered together, so that no longer was there room even in the approaches to the door,and he began speaking unto them the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>and they come, bearing unto him a paralytic, upborne by four,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>and, not being able to get near him by reason of the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was, and, having broken it up, they began letting down the couch whereon the paralytic was lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>and, Jesus, seeing their faith, saith unto the paralyticChild! forgiven are thy sins!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now there were certain of the Scribes there, sitting and deliberating in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why doth, this, man thus talk? he is speaking profanely! Who can forgive sins, save one, God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And Jesus, straightway, taking note in his spirit, that  thus  they are deliberating within themselves, saith  unto them Why, these things, are ye deliberating in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easierto say unto the paralytic, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Rise,  and  take up thy couch, and be walking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority to be forgiving sins upon the earth, he saith to the paralytic:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee, I say, Rise, take up thy couch, and be going thy way unto thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he arose, and, straightway taking up the couch, went forth before all,so that all were beside themselves and were glorifying God,  saying Thus, we never saw it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the sea,and all the multitude was coming unto him, and he began teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And, passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting over the tax-office,and saith unto himBe following me! And, arising, he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it cometh to pass, that he is reclining in his house, and many tax-collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many, and they began following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the Scribes and Pharisees, seeing that he was eating with the sinners and the tax-collectors, began saying unto his disciplesWith the tax-collectors and sinners, is he eating?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And, hearing it, Jesus saith unto themNo need, have the strong of a physician, but they who are sick, I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say unto himFor what cause, do, the disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees, fast, whereas, thy disciples, fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said unto themIs it possible for the sons of the bridechamber, while the bridegroom is with them, to be fasting? So long as they have the bridegroom with them, it is impossible, to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But there will come days, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and, then, they will fast, in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one, seweth a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old mantle,otherwise, at least, the shrinking teareth away from itthe new from the oldand, a worse rent is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And, no one, poureth new wine into fold skins,otherwise, at least, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and, the skins.  But new wine is for unused skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass, that he, on the Sabbath, was passing through the cornfields, and his disciples began to be going forward, plucking the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And, the Pharisees, were saying,See! why are they doing, on the Sabbath, what is not allowed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he saith unto themHave ye never read what David did, when he had need and hungered,he, and they who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'> how  he entered into the house of God, while Abiathar was High-priest, and, the presence-bread, did eat,which it is not allowed to eat, save unto the priests,and gave, unto them also who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he was saying unto themThe Sabbath, for man, was made, and not, man, for, the Sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So that the Son of Man is, Lord, even of the Sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into a synagogue, and there-was there, a man having, his hand, withered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they were narrowly watching him, whether, on the Sabbath, he would cure him, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he saith unto the man who hath his hand withered, Arise into the midst!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>and saith unto themIs it allowed, on the Sabbath, to do good, or to do evil? To, save, life, or, to slay? but they remained silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And, looking round upon them with anger, being at the same time grieved on account of the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the manStretch forth thy hand! and he stretched it forth, and his hand, was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And, the Pharisees, going out straightway with the Herodians, were giving counsel against him, that they should, destroy, him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And, Jesus, with his disciples, retired unto the sea; and, a great throng from Galilee, followed, also from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Zidon, a great throng, hearing whatsoever things he was doing, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spake unto his disciples that a little boat might attend him, because of the multitude,that they might not be pressing upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he cured many, so that they were besieging him, that they might touch himas many as had plagues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>and the impure spirits, as soon as they beheld him, were falling down to him, and crying aloud, while he was speaking, Thou, art the Son of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>and sternly was he rebuking them, lest they should make him manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goeth up into the mountain and calleth near whom, he, pleased,and they went away unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>and he appointed a twelve, whom also he named, Apostles,that they might be with him, and that he might be sending them forth to make proclamation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cast out the demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>and he appointed the twelve (and imposed a name on Simon) Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (and imposed on them a nameBoanerges, that is, sons of thunder);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up. And he cometh into a house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>and the multitude come together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And they who were near to him, hearing of it, went out to secure him,for they were sayingHe is beside himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And, the Scribes who from Jerusalem had come down, were sayingHe hath, Beelzebul; andIn the ruler of the demons, casteth he out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And, calling them near, in parables, began he to say unto themHow can, Satan, cast, Satan out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And, if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot be made to stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And, if a house against itself be divided, the house shall be unable to stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And, if, Satan, hath risen up against himself, and become divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But, no one is able into the house of the mighty one to enter, and, his spoils, to carry off, unless, first the mighty one, he bind, and, then his house, will he plunder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Verily, I say unto youAll things shall be forgiven unto the sons of men,the sins and the profanities wherewithal they shall profane;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But, whosoever shall revile against the Holy Spirit, hath no forgiveness, unto times age-abiding,but is guilty of an age-abiding sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they were sayingAn impure spirit, he hath!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And there come his mother and his brethren, and, standing, outside, they sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And there was sitting around him a multitude, and they say unto himLo! thy mother and thy brethren, outside, are seeking thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And, answering them, he saithWho are my mother and my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And, looking around on them who, about him, in a circle, were sitting, he saith, See! my mother and my brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same, is my brother and sister and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And, again, began he to be teaching by the sea; and there come together unto him a very great multitude, so that, he, into a boat, entering, was sitting upon the sea,-and, all the multitude, were, near the sea upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he began to teach them, in parables, many things, and was saying unto them, in his teaching</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hearken! Lo! the sower went forth to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some, indeed, fell by the pathway, and the birds came, and devoured it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And, some, fell on the rocky places,  even  where it had not much earth,and, straightway, it sprang forth, by reason of its not having depth of earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>and, when the sun arose, it was scorched,and, by reason of its not having root, it was dried up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And, some, fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and, fruit, it yielded not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And, other, fell into the good ground, and was yielding fruit, coming up and growing,and was bearing, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he was sayingHe that hath ears to hear, let him hear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone they who were about him with the twelve questioned him as to the parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>and he was saying unto themTo you, the sacred secret hath been given of the kingdom of God, whereas, to them who are outside, in parables are all things coming to pass,that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>They may surely look and yet not see, and surely hear and yet not understand, lest once they should return and it be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he saith unto themKnow ye not this parable? How then will ye get to know all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower, soweth the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are they beside the pathway where the word is sown,and, as soon as they hear, straightway, cometh Satan, and snatcheth away the word which hath been sown into them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are likewise they upon the rocky places sown,who, as soon as they hear the word, straightway, with joy receive it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and have no root in themselves, but, only for a season are,afterwards, when there ariseth tribulation or persecution by reason of the word, straightway, they find cause of stumbling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are they who among thorns are sown,these are they who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and, the anxieties of the age, and the deceit of wealth, and the covetings about the remaining things, entering in, choke up the word, and, unfruitful, it becometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And those yonder are they who on the good ground are sown,who, indeed, hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruitthirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he was saying unto themDoth the lamp come that under the measure it should be put, or under the couch? Is it not that upon the lampstand it may be put?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For it is not hidden, save that it may be made visible; neither did it get hidden away, but that it might come into a place where it could be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any one hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he was saying unto themBe taking heed what ye are hearing:with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you, and added unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For, he that hath, it shall be given, unto him, and, he that hath not, even what he hath, shall be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he was sayingThus, is the kingdom of God: As a man may cast seed upon the earth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>and, continually, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, was he crying aloud, and cutting himself in pieces with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And, seeing Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and, crying out with a loud voice, saithWhat have in common with thee? O Jesus, Son of God Most High? I adjure thee by God,Do not torment me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he was saying to himGo forth thou impure spirit, out of the man;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>And Jesus, answering, said unto themAs against a robber, came ye forth, with swords and clubs, to arrest me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>Daily, was I with you, in the temple, teaching; and ye secured me not. But, that, the Scriptures, may be fulfilled</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And, the High-priest rising up into the midst, questioned Jesus, sayingAnswerest thou, nothing? What are these, against thee, witnessing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But, he, was silent, and answered, nothing. Again, the High-priest was questioning him, and saith unto himArt, thou, the Christ the Son of the Blessed?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Heard ye the profanity? What, to you, doth it appear? And they, all, condemned him to be, worthy, of, death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to be spitting at him, and, covering up his face, and to be buffeting him, and saying to himProphesy! And, the attendants, with smart blows, took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And, Peter, being, below in the court, there cometh one of the maid-servants of the High-priest;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But, he, denied, sayingI neither know   , nor do I well understand what, thou, sayest; and went out into the porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And, the maid-servant, seeing him, began, again, to be saying unto the by-standersThis one, is, from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But, he, again, was denying. And, after a little again, the by-standers, were saying unto PeterTruly, thou, art, from among them; for thou art, a Galilaean, also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>And, he, began to be cursing and swearingI know not this man, of whom ye are speaking!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And, straightway, a second time, a cock, crowed; and Peter was reminded of the declaration, how Jesus had said to himBefore a cock, twice, crow, thrice, wilt thou deny me. And, when he thought thereon, he began to weep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And, straightway, early, when they had made, a council, the High-priest, with the Elders, and Scribes, and all the High-council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him up unto Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate questioned himArt, thou, the king of the Jews? And, he, answering him, saithThou, sayest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But, Jesus, no further, answered, anything, so that Pilate began to marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now, at feast time, he was wont to release unto them one prisoner, whom they were claiming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was the so-called Barabbas, with the rebels, bound, even with them who, in the rebellion, had committed, murder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he was getting to know that, for envy, had  the High-priests  delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But, the High-priests, stirred up the multitude, that, rather Barabbas, he should release unto them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And, they, again, cried outCrucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>But, Pilate, was saying unto themWhy! what, evil, hath he done? And, they, vehemently, cried outCrucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And Pilate, being minded to do what would satisfy, the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, having scourged him, that he should be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And, the soldiers, led him away, inside the court, which is a judgment-hall,and called together the whole band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>and they array him in purple, and set upon him, when they have plaited it; a crown of thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and began to be saluting himJoy to thee! King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>and were striking him on the head with a reed, and were spitting at him,and, bowing their knees, were doing him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And, when they had mocked him, they put off him, the purple, and put on him, his own garments. And they lead him forth, that they may crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they impress a certain passer-by, Simon a Cyrenian, coming from a field, the father of Alexander and Rufus,that he may carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him unto the Golgotha place, which is, being translated, Skull-place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of his accusation, had been inscribedTHE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And, with him, they crucify, two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And, the passers-by, were reviling him, shaking their heads, and sayingAha! thou who wast pulling down the shrine, and building one in three days!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>Save thyself,coming down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise, the High-priests also, mocking one to another, with the Scribes, were sayingOthers, he saved, himself, he cannot save!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>The Christ, the King of Israellet him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And, they who had been crucified with him, were casting it in his teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And, when it was the sixth hour, darkness, came on all the landuntil the ninth hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>and, at the ninth hour, Jesus, uttered a cry, with a loud voiceEloi! Eloi! lama sabachthanei? which is, being translatedMy God!  My God!  to what end, didst thou forsake me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But, Jesus, sending out a loud voice, ceased to breathe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And, the veil of the Temple, was rent into two, from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>Now the centurion, who was standing near, out over against him, seeing, that, thus, he ceased to breathe, saidTruly, this man, was Gods son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were, women also, from afar, looking on,among whom were both Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Little and Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who, when he was in Galilee, used to follow him, and minister unto him,and many other women, who had come up with him unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And evening, already, having begun, since it was a preparation, that is, the eve of a Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, a noble counsellor, who, also himself, was awaiting the kingdom of God, came; and, venturing, went in unto Pilate, and claimed the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>But, Pilate, wondered whether, already, he was dead; and, calling near the centurion, questioned himwhether he had, already, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And, getting to know from the centurion, he presented the corpse unto Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And, buying a fine Indian cloth, he took him down, and wrapped him about with the cloth, and laid him in a tomb, which had been hewn out of a rock,and rolled near a stone upon the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Now, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, were viewing how he had been laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And, the Sabbath having passed, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that, coming, they might anoint him.</verse>
