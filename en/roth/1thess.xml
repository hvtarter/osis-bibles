      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <title>For, he that acteth unrighteously, shall get back what he had unrighteously done, and there is no respect of persons;</title>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothyunto the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ,favour unto you, and peace!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We are giving thanks unto God continually, concerning you all, making, mention, in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>Unceasingly, rememberingyour work of faith and labour of love and endurance of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>How that, our glad-message, came not unto you, in word only, but also in power, and in Holy Spirit, and in much assurance,even as ye know what manner of men we became unto you, for your sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And, ye, became, imitators of us, and of the Lord, giving welcome unto the word, in much tribulation, with joy of Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that ye became an ensample unto all who were coming to the faith, in Macedonia and in Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>From you, in fact, hath sounded forth the word of the Lordnot only m Macedonia and in Achaia, but, in every place, your faith which is toward God, hath gone forth, so that, no need, have we to be saying anything;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For, they themselves, concerning us, do tellwhat manner of entrance we had unto you, and how ye turned unto God from the idolsto be serving a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>And awaiting his Son out of the heavenswhom he raised from among the dead,Jesus: Who is to rescue us out of the anger that is coming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For, yourselves, know, brethren, our entrance which was unto youthat it hath not proved void;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But, though we had previously suffered, and been insulted, even as ye know, in Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the glad-message of God with much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For, our exhortation, is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But, even as we have been approved by God, to be entrusted with the glad-message, so, we speak,not as, unto men, giving pleasure, but unto Godwho proveth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time were we found, using words of flattery,even as ye know, nor a pretext for greedGod, is witness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor, of men, seeking gloryeither from you, or from others, though we could have assumed, dignity, as Apostles of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we became gentle in your midst,as though, a nursing mother, had been cherishing her own children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Thus, yearning after you, we could have been well-pleased to impart unto younot only the glad-message of God, but, our own lives also,because, very dear to us, had ye become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brethren, our toil and hardship: night and day, working, so as not to be a burden unto any of you, we proclaimed unto you the glad-message of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye, are witnessesGod also, how kindly and righteously and blamelessly, unto you who were believing, we were found to behave;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>Even as ye know how, unto each one of you, we were as a father unto his own children, consoling you, and soothing, and calling o witness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>To the end ye might be walking in a manner worthy of God, who is calling you unto his own kingdom and glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And, for this cause, we, are also giving thanks unto God unceasingly, that, when ye received a spoken word from uswhich was Gods, ye welcomed itnot as a human word, but, even as it truly is, a divine word,which is also inwardly working itself in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For, ye, became, imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea, in Christ Jesus, in that, the same things, ye, also suffered by your own fellow-countrymen, even as, they, also by the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who have both slain the, Lord, Jesusand the prophets, and, us, have persecuted, and, unto God, are displeasing, and, unto all men, are contrary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Hindering us from speaking, unto the nations, that they might be saved, to the filling up of their own sins, continually; but anger hath overtaken them at length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>Now, we, brethren, having been bereaved away from you, for the season of an hour,in presence, not in heart, gave more abundant diligence, your face, to behold, with much longing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Wherefore, we desired to come unto youeven, I, Paul, both once and again,and, Satan, thwarted us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what shall be our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Shall not even, ye, before our Lord Jesus, in his Presence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>Ye, in fact, are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore, no longer concealing our anxiety, we were well-pleased to be left in Athens, alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And sent Timothyour brother, and Gods minister in the glad-message of the Christthat he might confirm and console you over your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That, no one, might be shrinking back in these tribulations. For ye, yourselves, know, that, hereunto, are we appointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For, even when we were with you, we told you beforehandwe are destined to suffer tribulation! even as it also came to pass, and ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause, I also, no longer concealing my anxiety, sent, that I might get to know your faith, lest by any means he that tempteth, should have tempted you, and, in vain, should have been our toil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But, when, just now, Timothy came unto us, from you, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love,and that ye have good remembrance of us, continually, longing to see, us,even as, we also, to see you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>For this cause, were we consoled, brethren, over you, in all our necessity and tribulation, through your faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>Because, now, we live,if only, ye, stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanksgiving can we render back, unto God, concerning you, on occasion of all the joy wherewith we rejoice, for your sakes, before our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day, making very abundant entreaties, that we may see your face, and fit in the things which are lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may, our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus, make straight our way unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And, you, may the Lord cause to abound and excel in your love one toward another, and toward all,even as, we, do toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>To the end he may confirms your hearts, faultless in holiness, before our God and Father, in the Presence of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>For the rest, brethren, we request and exhort you, in our Lord Jesus,  that , even as ye received from us, how ye must needs walk and please God,even as ye also do walk, that ye would abound still more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye know what charges we gave you, through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For, this, is a thing willed of God, your sanctification,that ye should abstain from unchastity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That ye should know, each one of you, how, of his own vessel, to possess himself in sanctification and honour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not with a passion of coveting,just as even the nations who know not God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>Not over-reaching and defrauding, in the matter, his brother; because, an avenger, is the Lord, concerning all these things,even as we before told you, and solemnly called you to witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us, with a permission of impurity, but, in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore, indeed, he that disregardethit is, not a man, he disregardeth, but God,Who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But, concerning brotherly loveno need, have ye, that we be writing unto you; for, ye yourselves, are, God-taught, to the loving of one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And, in fact, ye are doing it unto all the brethren  who are  in the whole of Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, to abound still more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And to be ambitious to be quiet, and to be attending to your own affairs, and to be working with your hands,even as, unto you, we gave charge</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That ye should walk reputably toward those without, and, of no one, have, need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are falling asleep,lest ye be sorrowing, even as the rest also, who are without hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For, if we believe that, Jesus, died, and rose again, so, also will, God, bring forth with him, them who have fallen asleep through Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For, this, unto you, do we say, by a word of the Lord,that, we, the living who are left unto the Presence of the Lord, shall in nowise get before them who have fallen asleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Because, the Lord himself, with a word of command, with a chief-messengers voice, and with a trumpet of God, shall descend from heaven,and, the dead in Christ, shall rise, first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>After that, we, the living who are left, together with them, shall be caught away, in clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:and, thus, evermore, with the Lord, shall we be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>So then, be consoling one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But, concerning the times and the seasons, brethren,ye have, no need, that, unto you, anything be written;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For, ye yourselves, perfectly well knowthat, the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so, cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>As soon as they begin to sayPeace! and safety! then, suddenly, upon them, cometh destruction,just as the birth-throe unto her that is with child,and in nowise shall they escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But, ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that, the day, upon you, as upon thieves, should lay hold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>For, all ye, are, sons of light, and sons of day,we are not of night, nor of darkness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Hence, then, let us not be sleeping, as the rest, but let us watch and be sober:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For, they that sleep, by night, do sleep, and, they that drink, by night, do drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But, we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and, for helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>Because God did not appoint us unto anger, but unto acquiring salvation through our Lord Jesus  Christ :</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Who died for us, in order that, whether we be watching or sleeping, together with him, we should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore be consoling one another, and building up, each the other,even as ye are also doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now we request you, brethren,to know them who are toiling among you, and presiding over you, in the Lord, and admonishing you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>And to hold them in very high esteem, in love, their works sake. Be at peace among yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>But we exhort you, brethrenadmonish the disorderly, soothe them of little soul, help the weak, be longsuffering towards all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none, evil for evil, unto any, do render: but, evermore, what is good, be pursuing, towards one another, and towards all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Evermore, rejoice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Unceasingly, pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything, give thanks,for, this, is a thing willed of God, in Christ Jesus, towards you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>The Spirit, do not quench,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Prophesyings, do not despise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'> But , all things, put to the proofwhat is comely, hold ye fast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>From every form of wickedness, abstain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>But, the God of peace himself, hallow you completely, and, entire, might your spirit, and soul, and body,  unblameable in the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ,be preserved!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful, is he that is calling you,who, also will perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren! be praying for us  also .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you, by the Lord, that the letter be read unto all the brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with you.</verse>
