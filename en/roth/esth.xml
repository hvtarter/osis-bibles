      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <title>Now, all Israelin the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, used to give the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, the need of a day upon its day,and they hallowed them unto the Levites, and, the Levites, hallowed them unto the sons of Aaron.</title>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>And it came to pass, in the days of Ahasuerus,the same, Ahasuerus that reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>in those days,when King Ahasuerus was sitting on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shusan the palace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign, he made a banquet unto all his rulers, and his servants,the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and the rulers being before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>when he showed the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the splendour of his excellent majesty, many days, a hundred and eighty days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>that, when these days were fulfilled, the king madefor all the people that were present in Shusan the palace, both for great and smalla banquet, seven days,in the court of the garden of the palace of the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>white stuff, cotton and blue, being held fast with cords of fine linen and purple, upon rods of silver, and pillars of white marble,the couches being of gold and silver, upon a pavement of alabaster and white marble, and pearl and black marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, vessels, from vessels, being diverse,even the wine of the kingdom in abundance, by the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And, the drinking, was according to the law, no one compelling,for, so, had the king appointed unto every chief of his household, that every man, should do according to his pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen, made a banquet for the women,in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when merry was the heart of the king with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who were waiting before King Ahasuerus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring in Vashti the queen, with the royal crown,to show the peoples and the rulers her beauty, for, of pleasing appearance, was she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But Queen Vashti refused to come in at the command of the king, which was given through the eunuchs,and the king was exceeding wroth, and, his anger, burned within him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then said the king unto the wise men having knowledge of the times,for, so, was the manner of the king before all having knowledge of law and judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>and, near unto him, were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan,the seven rulers of Persia and Media, who used to behold the face of the king, who sat first, in the kingdom</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>According to law, what ought to be done, with Queen Vashti,for that she hath not performed the command of King Ahasuerus, through the eunuchs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>Then said Memucan before the king and the rulers, Not against the king alone, hath Vashti the queen acted perversely,but against all the rulers, and against all the peoples, who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For the report of the queen, will go forth, unto all women, so putting contempt upon their lords, in their eyes,when it is reported to them, King Ahasuerus, commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>And, this day, shall the ladies of Persia and Media, who have heard the report of the queen, tell it, unto all the lords of the king,with enough of contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If, unto the king, it seem good, let there go forth a royal declaration from before him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Media, so that it shall not pass away,That Vashti, is not to come in, before King Ahasuerus, and, her royal estate, let the king give unto her neighbour, who is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>When the edict of the king which he shall make, is published throughout all his kingdom, for, great, it is, then, all wives, will give honour unto their lords, both great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the thing seemed good in the eyes of the king, and the rulers,and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>So he sent letters, into all the provinces of the king, into every province according to she writing thereof, and unto every people according to their tongue,That every man should he ruler in his own house, and issue his commands, according to the tongue of his people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then said the young men of the king, who waited upon him,Let them seek out for the king young virgins, of pleasing appearance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>and let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom, and let them gather together every young virgin of pleasing appearance unto Shusan the palace, unto the house of the women, into the custody of Hegai eunuch of the king, keeper of the women, and let there be given the things needed for their purification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>and, the maiden that is pleasing in the eyes of the king, let her be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing seemed good in the eyes of the king, and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>A certain Jew, there was, in Shusan the palace,whose, name, was Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a man of Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been exiled from Jerusalem, with the exiles who were carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,whom, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, exiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And it came to pass, that he was bringing up Hadassah, the same, was Esther, his uncles daughter, for she had neither father nor mother,and, the maiden, was of beautiful form and pleasing appearance, and when her father and mother died, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the kings command and decree was heard, and there had been gathered together many maidens unto Shusan the palace, unto the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the house of the king, unto the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>and the maiden was pleasing in his eyes, and she received lovingkindness before him, and he hastened to give her, the things needed for her purification, and things apportioned her, and to give her, seven select maidens, out of the house of the king,and he removed her and her maidens to the best place in the house of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not told of her people, nor of her kindred,for, Mordecai, had laid charge upon her, that she should not tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And, throughout every day, Mordecai, used to walk to and fro, before the court of the house of the women,to get to know the welfare of Esther, and what would be done with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now, when the turn of each maiden came, to go in unto King Ahasuerus, after it had been done to her according to the law of the women for twelve months, for, so, were filled the days of their purification,six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes, and with things for the purification of the women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>then, indeed, the maiden came in unto the king,whatsoever she might mention, was given her, to go with her, out of the house of the women up to the house of the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>in the evening, she went in, and, in the morning, she returnedunto the second house of the women, unto the custody of Shaashgaz the kings eunuch, who kept the concubines,she went not in again unto the king, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>But, when the turn came for Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecaiwho had taken her as his own daughterto go in unto the king, she requested nothing, save what Hegai the kings eunuch who kept the women might direct,but so it was, that Esther obtained favour in the eyes of all who beheld her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So then Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus, into his royal house, in the tenth month, the same, was the month Tebeth,in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favour and lovingkindness before him, above all the virgins,so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen, instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great banquet, for all his rulers and his servants, the banquet of Esther,and, a remission, for all the provinces, made he, and gave a present, according to the bounty of a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>Now, when virgins were gathered together second time, then, Mordecai, was sitting in the gate of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not told of her kindred, nor her people, as, Mordecai, had laid charge upon her,and, the command of Mordecai, Esther performed, like as when she was being brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, when, Mordecai, was sitting in the gate of the king, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the eunuchs of the king who guarded the threshold, were wroth, and sought to thrust a hand upon King Ahasuerus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>but the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen,and Esther told it unto the king, in the name of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And, when the thing was searched into and found</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things, did King Ahasuerus promote to power Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and exalted him,and placed his seat above all the rulers who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And, all the kings servants who were in the kings gate, used to bend and bow themselves down unto Haman, for, so, had the king given command concerning him,but, Mordecai, bent not nor bowed himself down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then said the kings servants who were in the kings gate unto Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Wherefore art, thou, transgressing the command of the king? And it came to pass, when they had spoken unto him day by day, and he had not hearkened unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether the account of Mordecai would stand, for he had told them, that, he, was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And, when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bend nor bow down unto him, then was Haman filled with wrath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>but, it was contemptible in his eyes, to thrust forth a hand on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai,and Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout all the kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first monththe same, was the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, was Pur castthe same, is the Lot, before Haman, from day to day, and from month to month,and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the same, is the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>Then said Haman unto King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people, scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples, throughout all the provinces of thy kingdom,whose laws, are diverse from every people, and, the laws of the king, they observe not, for the king, therefore, it is not fit, to suffer them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If, unto the king, it seem good, let it be written, to destroy them,and, ten thousand talents of silver, will I weigh out upon the hands of them who are doing the business, to bring   into the treasuries of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>So then the king took his signet-ring from off his hand, and gave it unto Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the adversary of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>and the king said unto Haman, The silver, is granted thee,and the people, to do with them, as may seem good in thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then were called the scribes of the king, in the first month, on the thirteenth day therein, and it was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the satraps of the king, and unto the pashas, who were over every province, and unto the rulers of every people, every province according to the writing thereof, and every people according to the tongue thereof,in the name of King Ahasuerus, was it written, and sealed with the signet- ring of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>Then were sent letters, by the hand of the runners, into all the provinces of the king, To destroy, to slay and to cause to perish all Jews, both young and old, little ones and women, in one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, the same, is the month Adar,and the spoil of them to be a prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>A copy of the writing, to be delivered as an edict throughout every province, was published to all the peoples,that they should be ready against this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The runners, went forth, urged on by the word of the king, and, the edict, was given in Shusan the palace,and, the king and Haman, sat down to drink, but, the city of Shusan, was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>When, Mordecai, came to know all that had been done, Mordecai rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and ashes,and went forth into the midst of the city, and cried out with an outcry loud and bitter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>and went in as far as before the gate of the king,for, none, might enter into the gate of the king, clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And, throughout every province, whithersoever the word of the king and his edict came, was great mourning to the Jews, and fasting and weeping, and lamentation,sackcloth and ashes, were spread out for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>So the maidens of Esther and her eunuchs went in and told her, and the queen writhed in great anguish,and sent garments to clothe Mordecai, and to remove his sackcloth from off him, but he accepted them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the eunuchs of the king whom he had stationed before her, and charged him, concerning Mordecai,to get to know what this was, and why this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hathach went forth unto Mordecai,in the broadway of the city, which was before the gate of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him all that had befallen him,and an exact statement of the silver, that Haman had promised to weigh out unto the treasuries of the king, for the Jews, to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also, a copy of the writing of the edict which had been given in Shusan to destroy them, gave he unto him, to shew unto Esther, and to tell her,and to lay charge upon her, to go in unto the kingto make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hathach came in and told Esther, the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Then spake Esther unto Hathach,and gave him charge, unto Mordecai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the servants of the king, and the people of the provinces of the king, do know, that, whatsoever man or woman shall go in unto the kinginto the inter courtwho hath not been called, one, is his law, to put him to death, saving any to whom the king may hold out the golden sceptre, who then shall live,but, I, have not been called to go in unto the king, these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told Mordecai, the words of Esther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther,Do not think in thine own soul, to escape in the house of the king from among all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>But, if thou, do indeed hold thy peace, at this time, respite and deliverance, will be appointed for the Jews, from another place, but, thou, and thy fathers house, will perish,and who knoweth whether, for a time such as this, thou hast attained unto the royal estate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther commanded, to answer Mordecai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go! gather ye together all the Jews who are to be found in Shusan, and fast ye for meand neither eat nor drinkthree days, night nor day, and, I and my maidens, will fast so,and, in this manner, will I go in unto the king, though it is not according to the law, and, when I have perished, I have perished!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai departed,and did according to all that Esther had charged upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>And it came to pass, on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the house of the king, over against the house of the king,and, the king, was sitting upon his royal seat, in the royal house, over against the opening of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it came to pass, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his eyes,and the king held out to Esther, the golden sceptre which was in his hand, so Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then said the king unto her, What aileth thee, Queen Esther? and what is thy request? Unto the half of the kingdom, shall it be given thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>Then said Esther, If, unto the king, it seem good, let the king with Haman come in this day, unto the banquet which I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>And the king said, Hasten ye Haman, to perform the word of Esther. So the king with Haman came in, unto the banquet which Esther had prepared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>Then said the king unto Esther, during the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, that it may be granted thee?and what is thy request-unto the half of the kingdomthat it may be performed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then answered Esther, and said,As touching my petition and my request,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found favour in the eyes of the king, and if, unto the king, it seem good, to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king with Haman come in unto the banquet which I will prepare for them, and, to-morrow, I will do according to the word of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then went Haman forth on that day, joyful and of a merry heart,but, when Haman saw Mordecai in the gate of the king, that he rose not up nor moved because of him, then was Haman filled with wrath against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and came into his own house,and sent and brought in his friends, and Zeresh his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>and Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children,and all the things wherein the king had promoted him to power, and how he had advanced him, above the rulers and the servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>And Haman said, Moreover Esther the queen did bring in no one with the king into the banquet which she had prepared, saving myself,yea moreover, even for to-morrow, I, am invited unto her, with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet, all this, sufficeth me not,so long as, I, see Mordecai the Jew, sitting in the gate of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let them make ready a gallows, of the height of fifty cubits, and, in the morning, speak thou unto the king, that they hang Mordecai thereon, then go with the king into the banquet joyfully. And the thing seemed good before Haman, and he made ready the gallows.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>During that night, the sleep of the king fled,and he commanded to bring in the book of remembrance, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written, how that Mordecai had told concerning Bigthana and Teresh, the two eunuchs of the king guarding the threshold,who had sought to thrust forth a hand upon King Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>Then said the king, What honour and dignity hath been done unto Mordecai, for this? Then said the kings young men, who were ministering unto him, Nothing hath been done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>Then said the king, Who is in the court? Now, Haman, had come into the outer court of the kings house, to speak unto the king, to hang Mordecai, upon the gallows which he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>So the kings young men said unto him, Lo! Haman, standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in, and the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man in whose honour, the king delighteth? Then said Haman, in his own heart, Unto whom will the king delight to do honour, more than unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>So Haman said unto the king,As touching the man in whose honour, the king, delighteth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let them bring in royal apparel wherewith the king hath clothed himself,and the horse whereon the king hath ridden, and the royal crown which hath been set upon his own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>and let the apparel and the horse be delivered unto the hand of one of the kings rulers, one of the nobles, and so let them array the man, in whose honour, the king, delighteth,and cause him to ride upon the horse through the broadway of the city, and let them proclaim before him, Thus and thus, shall it be done unto the man in whose honour, the king, delighteth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then said the king unto Haman, Haste, take the apparel and the horse, just as thou hast said, and do even so unto Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting in the kings gate,do not let fail a thing, of all which thou hast spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>So Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,and caused him to ride through the broadway of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus and thus, shall it be done unto the man in whoso honour, the king, delighteth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>Then Mordecai returned unto the gate of the king,but, Haman, hurried unto his own house, mourning, and with covered head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife, and unto all his friends, everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men, and Zeresh his wife, unto him, If, of the seed of the Jews, is Mordecai before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt, utterly fall, before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>While yet they were speaking with him, the eunuchs of the king, had come,and they hastened to bring Haman, unto the banquet which Esther had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman came in, to banquet with Esther the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>Then said the king unto Esther, on the second day also, during the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, Queen Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what is thy requestunto the half of the kingdomthat it may be performed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then answered Esther the queen, and said, If I have found favour in thine eyes, O king, and if, unto the king, it seem good, let my life be granted me, as my petition, and my people, as my request;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain and to be caused to perish. If indeed, for bondmen and for bondwomen, we had been sold, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have made good the damage to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>Then spake King Ahasuerus, and said unto Esther the queen,Who is he now, and where is he, whose heart is set to act thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said, A man who is an adversary and enemy, this wicked Haman. And, Haman, was terrified, before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>Now, the king, arising in his wrath from the banquet of wine, and going into the palace garden, Haman, stood to make request for his life from Esther the queen, for he saw that ruin, was determined against him, by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>When, the king, returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, Haman, was lying prostrate upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he, even dare to force the queen, while I am in the house? No sooner had the word gone forth out of the mouth of the king, than, the face of Haman, they had covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>Then said Harbonahone of the eunuchs before the kingYea lo! the gallows that Haman made ready for Mordecai, who had spoken well for the king, is standing in Hamans house, of a height of fifty cubits. Then said the king, Hang him thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai,and, the wrath of the king, was appeased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that day, did King Ahasuerus give unto Esther the queen, the house of Haman, the adversary of the Jews,and, Mordecai, came in before the king, for Esther had told, what he was to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>And the king took off his signet-ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai,and Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>Yet again, spake Esther before the king, and fell down at his feet,and wept and made supplication unto him, to cause the mischief of Haman the Agagite to pass away, even the plot which he had plotted against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>And the king held out unto Esther, the golden sceptre,so Esther arose, and stood before the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>and saidIf, unto the king, it seem good, and if I have found favour before him, and the thing be approved before the king, and, I myself, be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written, to reverse the letters plotted by Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy thee Jews, who are in all the provinces of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how can I endure to see the ruin that shall overtake my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>Then said King Ahasuerus unto Esther the queen, and unto Mordecai the Jew,Lo! the house of Haman, have I given unto Esther, and, him, have they hanged upon the gallows, because he thrust forth his hand against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>Ye, therefore, write concerning the Jews as may seem good in your own eyes, in the name of the king, and seal it with the kings signet-ring,for a writing which hath been written in the kings name, and sealed with the kings signet-ring, none can reverse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>Then were called the kings scribes at that timein the third month, the same, is the month Siwan, on the twenty-third thereof, and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and unto the satraps and pashas and rulers of the provinces, which are from India even unto Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, every province according to the writing thereof, and every people according to their tongue,and unto the Jews, according to their writing, and according to their tongue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>and he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the kings signet-ring,and sent letters by the hand of runners on horses, riding the swift steeds used in the kings service, bred of the stud:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>That the king had granted unto the Jews who were in every city, to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perishall the force of the people and province who should distress them, their little ones and women,and   the spoil of them as a prey:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>upon one day, throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus,upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month, the same, is the month Adar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>A copy of the writing to be given, as an edict, throughout every province, was published to all the peoples,and that the Jews be ready against that day, to avenge themselves on their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>The runners that rode on the swift steeds used in the kings service, went forth, being urged forward and pressed on, by the word of the king,and, the edict, was given in Shusan the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>And, Mordecai, went forth from the presence of the king, in royal apparel, of blue and white, with a large diadem of gold, and a mantle of fine linen and purple,and, the city Shusan, was bright and joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>To the Jews, had come light, and joy,and gladness and honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And, in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the word of the king and his edict did reach, joy and gladness, had the Jews,a banquet and a happy day,and, many from among the peoples of the land, were becoming Jews, for the dread of the Jews had fallen upon them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>And, in the twelfth month, the same, is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day thereof, when the word of the king and his edict arrived to be put in execution,on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, though it, was changed, so that the Jews themselves should have power over them who hated them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>the Jews assembled themselves together in their cities, throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to thrust forth a hand against them who were seeking their hurt, and, no man, stood before them, for the dread of them had fallen upon all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>And, all the rulers of the provinces, and the satraps and the pashas, and the doers of business that pertained to the king, were extolling the Jews,for the dread of Mordecai, had fallen upon them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>since great was Mordecai, in the house of the king, and, his fame, was going forth throughout all the provinces,for, the man Mordecai, went on waxing great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>So then the Jews smote all their enemies, with the smiting of the sword and slaughter, and destruction,and they dealt with them who hated them according to their pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>Yea, in Shusan the palace, did the Jews slay and destroy five hundred men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the adversary of the Jews, slew they,but, on the spoil, thrust they not forth their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>On that day, came in the number of the slain into Shusan the palace, before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>Then said the king unto Esther the queen, In Shusan the palace, have the Jews slain and caused to perish five hundred men, and the ten sons of Haman,in the rest of the provinces of the king, what have they done? What, then, is thy petition, that it may be granted thee? and what is thy request further, that it may he performed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>Then said Esther, If, unto the king, it seem good, let it be granted, to-morrow also, unto the Jews who are in Shusan, to do according to the edict of to-day,and that, the ten sons of Haman, be hanged upon the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>And the king commanded it to be done so, and there was given an edict, in Shusan,and, the ten sons of Haman, they hanged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>So the Jews who were in Shusan assembled themselves together, on the fourteenth day also, of the month Adar, and slew in Shusan three hundred men,but, on the spoil, thrust they not forth their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>And, the remainder of the Jews who were in the provinces of the king, assembled themselves together and stood for their life, and then had rest from their enemies, having slain of them that hated them seventy-five thousand,but, on the spoil, thrust they not forth their hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>on the thirteenth day of the month Adar,and then had rest on the fourteenth day thereof, and made it a day of banqueting and rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But, the Jews who were in Shusan, assembled themselves together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth day thereof,and then had rest on the fifteenth day thereof, and made it a day of banqueting and rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>For this cause, the country Jews, who dwelt in the country towns, were making the fourteenth day of the month Adar one of rejoicing and banqueting, and a day of happiness,and of sending portions every one to his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mordecai wrote these things,and sent letters unto all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, near, and far off;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>to establish for them, that they should continue to observe the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day thereof,always year by year;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>according to the days wherein the Jews found rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned for them, from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to a happy day,that they should make them days of banqueting and rejoicing, and of sending portions, every one to his neighbour, and gifts, unto the needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>And the Jews took upon them that which they had begun to do,and that which Mordecai had written unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>because, Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews, to cause them to perish,and had cast Pur, the same, is the Lot, to terrify them, and to destroy them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>but, by   going in before the king, he commanded by letter, that his wicked plot which he had plotted against the Jews, should return, upon his own head,and that he and his sons should be hanged upon the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>For this cause, called they these days Purim, after the name Pur, for this cause,for all the words of this epistle,and what they had seen concerning such a matter, and what had reached unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>The Jews established and took upon themselvesand upon their seed, and upon all who should join themselves unto them, that it might not pass away, that they would continue to keep these two days, according to the writing concerning them and at their set time,always year by year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>And, these days, were to be remembered and to be kept, always from generation to generation, by every family, every province, and every city,that, these days of Purim, should not pass away, out of the midst of the Jews, and, the memorial of them, not cease from their seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>Then wrote Esther the queen daughter of Abihail and Mordecai the Jew, with all authority,to confirm this second epistle concerning the Purim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>and he sent letters unto all the Jews, throughout the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,words of peace and stability:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>to establish these days of the Purim, in their set times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined upon them, and according as they had enjoined upon their own soul, and upon their seed,the story of the fastings and of their outcry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>And, the command of Esther, confirmed the story of these Purim,and it was written in a book.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>And King Ahasuerus laid tribute upon the land, and upon the shores of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>But, all the acts of his authority, and his might, and the clear story of the promotion of Mordecai, wherewith the king promoted him, are, they, not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>For, Mordecai the Jew, was next unto King Ahasuerus, and became great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren,seeking happiness for his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</verse>
