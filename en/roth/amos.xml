        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>Ye who are putting far away the day of calamity,but bringing near the abode of violence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>Who are lying on beds of ivory, and sprawling on their couch of pleasure,and eating the well-fed of the flock, and the fatted calves out of the midst of the stalls:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>Who are quaffing bowls of wine, and, with the best of oils, anointing themselves,and are not afflicted for the injury of Joseph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore, at once, shall they go into exile among the first of the exiles,so shall be disturbed the revelry of sprawlers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>Sworn hath the Lord, Yahweh, by his own life, Declareth Yahweh, God of hosts, abhorring am I, the grandeur of Jacob, and, his palaces, I hate,therefore will I cast off the city and the fulness thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>And a mans near of kin, even he who is about to burn the bones, shall carry him out of the house, when he shall say to him that is in the hinder parts of the houseAre there yet any with thee? and he shall sayNo one. Then shall he sayHush! for we must not invoke the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For lo! Yahweh, is giving command, and will smite the great house into ruins,and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run upon crag? or will a man plough   with oxen? For ye have turned to poison the sentence of justice, and the fruit of righteousness, to wormwood:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But, at Bethel, not again, any more, mayest thou prophesy,for, the holy place of the king, it is, and, the house of the kingdom, it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said unto Amaziah, No prophet, was I,nor the son of a prophet, was I,but, a herdman, was I, and a preparer of sycamore fruit;</verse>
