      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <title>Lest, when I again come, my God should humble me in regard to you,and I should grieve over many who had before sinned, and not repented of the impurity, and fornication, and wantonness which they had committed.</title>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle,not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from among the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>And all the brethren with me;unto the assemblies of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Favour unto you and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>Unto whom be the glory unto the ages of ages: Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that, thus quickly, ye are moving away from him that called you in the favour of Christ, unto a different glad-message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>Which is not, another, only there are, some, that are troubling you, and wishing to change the glad-message of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But, even if, we, or, a messenger out of heaven, announce a glad-message  unto you  aside from that which we announced unto you, accursed, let him be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, even now, again, I say: If anyone is announcing unto you a glad-message aside from that which ye accepted, accursed, let him be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For am I, even now, persuading, men, or God? Or am I seeking to please, men? If I had been still pleasing, men, Christs servant, had I not been!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>For I make known unto you, brethren, as to the glad-message which was announced by me, that it is not after man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For neither, from man, did I accept it, nor was taught   ,but through a revealing of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard, as to my own manner of life, at one time, in Judaism, how that, exceedingly, was I persecuting the assembly of God, and laying it waste,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And was making advancement, in Judaism, above many contemporaries in my nation, being, surpassingly zealous, of my paternal instructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But, when God, who set me apart from my mothers womb and called me through his favour, was well-pleased</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me, that I might announce the glad-message regarding him among the nations, straightway, I conferred not with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>Neither went I up unto Jerusalem unto them who, before me, were apostles,but I went away into Arabia, and again returned unto Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then, after three years, went I up unto Jerusalem, to become acquainted with Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But, other of the apostles, saw I none, save James the brother of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now, as touching the things which I am writing to you, lo! before God, I am not guilty of falsehood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>After that, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And was still unknown, by face, unto the assemblies of Judaea which were in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>Only they were hearingHe that was persecuting us formerly, now, is announcing the glad-message of the faith which he formerly laid waste;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they were glorifying, God, in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>After that, fourteen years later, I, again, went up unto Jerusalem, with Barnabas, taking with me Titus also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation, and laid before them the glad-message which I proclaim among the nations; privately, however, to them of repute,lest, by any means, in vain, I should be running, or had run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But, not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But,   because of the false brethren secretly introduced,who, indeed, came in secretly to spy out our freedom, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>Unto whom, not even for an hour, gave we place by the   submission,in order that, the truth of the glad-message, might still abide with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>Moreover, from them who were reputed to be something,whatsoever at one time, they were, maketh no difference to me, God accepteth not a mans person,unto me, in fact, they who were of repute added nothing further;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But, on the contrary,when they saw that I had been entrusted with the glad-message to the uncircumcision, even as, Peter,   to the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>For, he that energised in Peter, into an apostleship to the circumcision, energised also in me, for the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>And when they perceived the favour which had been given unto me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave, the right hand of fellowship, unto me and Barnabas, in order that, we,   unto the nations, and, they, unto the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>Only that we should remember, the destitute,as to which I had given diligence, this very thing, to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But, when Cephas came unto Antioch, to the face,   , him, I resisted, because he stood condemned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For, before that certain came from James, with them of the nations, used he to eat; whereas, when they came, he used to withdraw, and keep himself separate, fearing them of the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews  also  used hypocrisy with him, so that, even Barnabas, was carried away by their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But, when I saw that they were not walking with straightforwardness as regardeth the truth of the glad-message, I said unto Cephas, before all: If, thou, although, a Jew, like them of the nations, and not like the Jews, dost live, how dost thou compel, them of the nations, to live like Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We, by nature Jews, and not sinners from among the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Knowing, however, that a man is not declared righteous by works of law,   save through faith in Christ Jesus; even we, on Christ Jesus, believed, that we might be declared righteousby faith in Christ, and not by works of law; because, by works of law, shall no flesh be declared righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>Now, if in seeking to be declared righteous in Christ we, ourselves also, were found sinners,is Christ, therefore, a minister, of sin? Far be it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For, if, the things that I pulled down, these, again, I build, a transgressor, I prove, myself, to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For, I, through means of law, unto law, died, that, unto God, I might live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>With Christ, have I been crucified; and, living no longer, am, I, but, living in me, is, Christ,while, so far as I now do live in flesh, by faith, I liveThe faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up in my behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not set aside the favour of God; for, if, through law, is righteousness, then, Christ, without cause, died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O thoughtless Galatians! who hath bewitched you,before whose very eyes, Jesus Christ, was openly set forth as a crucified one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only, am I wishing to learn from you:by works of law, received ye, the Spirit? or by a believed report?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>So thoughtless, are ye? Having made a beginning in Spirit, are ye, now, in flesh, to be made complete?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Such things, suffered ye, in vain,if at least   even in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He then who was supplying unto you the Spirit, and energising mighty works among you, by works of law, or by a believed report</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abrahambelieved in God, and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Be taking note, thereforethat, they who are of faith, the same, are, sons, of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And, the scripture, foreseeing, that, by faith, God would declare the nations righteous, fore-announced the good news unto Abraham, saying, All the nations shall be blessed in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then, they who are of faith, are blessed with believing Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For, as many as are of works of law, are, under a curse,for it is writtenAccursed, is everyone that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Moreover, that, in law, no one, is declared righteous with God,   evident,because, The righteous one, by faith, shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>And, the law, is not of faith, buthe that hath done them, shall live in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ, hath redeemed, us, out of the curse of the law, having become, in our behalf, a curse;because it is writtenCursed, is every one that hangeth upon a tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>In order that, unto the nations, the blessing of Abraham, might come about in Jesus Christ,in order that, the promise of the Spirit, we might receive through means of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren! in human fashion, am I speaking: yet still, a mans confirmed covenant, no one setteth aside or addeth unto:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now, unto Abraham, were spoken the promisesand unto his seed;He saith notand unto thy seeds, as of many, but, as of oneand unto thy seed, which is Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And, this, I saya covenant previously confirmed by God, the law which, after four hundred and thirty years, hath been brought into being, doth not annul, so as to do away with the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For, if, by law, is the inheritance, it is, no longer, by promise; but, unto Abraham, through promise, hath God favoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why, then, the law? Because of the transgressions, it was added, until such time as the seed should come, unto whom the promise had been made, and was given in charge through messengers, at the hand of a mediator;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now, a mediator, is not   of one, but, God, is, one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is, the law, then, against the promises  of God ? Far be it! For, if a law had been given, which had been able to give life, verily, in law, would have been our righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the Scripture, did shut up, all things, under sin, that, the promise by faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to them who have faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>Before the coming of the faith, however, under law, were we being kept in ward, being shut up unto the faith which should afterwards, be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So that, the law, hath proved, our tutor, training us, for Christ, in order that, by faith, we might be declared righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But, the faith having come, no longer, are we, under a tutor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye, all, are, sons of God, through the faith in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For ye, as many as, into Christ, have been immersed, have put Christ, on:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There cannot be Jew or Greek, there cannot be bond or free, there cannot be male and female, for, all ye, are one, in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>Now, if, ye, are of Christ, by consequence ye are, Abrahams seed, according to promise, heirs.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>But I say:for as long a time as, the heir, is an infant, he differeth, nothing, from a servant, though, lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>But is, under guardians, and stewards, until the   fore-appointed of the father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So also, we, when we were infants, under the elementary principles of the world, were held in servitude;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But, when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, who came to be of a woman, who came to be under law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>That, them who were under law, he might redeem, that, the sonship, we might duly receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And, because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, exclaiming, Abba! Oh Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So that, no longer, art thou a servant, but a son; and, if a son, an heir also, through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But, at that timenot knowing God, ye were in servitude unto them who, by nature, are not Gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>Whereas, now, having acknowledged God,or rather, having been acknowledged by God, how turn ye back again unto the weak and beggarly elementary principles, unto which, over again, ye are wishing, to come into servitude?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Days, ye do narrowly observer, and months, and seasons, and years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid of youlest by any means, in vain, I should have toiled for you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Become ye as, I, because, I also,   as, ye,brethren, I entreat you. Not at all, have ye wronged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>Howbeit ye know that, by reason of a weakness of the flesh, I myself announced the glad-message unto you, formerly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And, your trial, in my flesh, ye despised not, neither spat ye   , but, as a messenger of God, ye welcomed meas Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where, then, is the happiness ye accounted yours? For I bear you witnessthat, if possible, your eyes, ye would have dug out, and given unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>So then, your enemy, have I become, by dealing truthfully with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They shew a zeal for you, not honourably, but wish, to shut you out, in order that ye may be zealous for, them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>Howbeit it is, honourable, to show zeal in what is honourable at all times, and not only when I am present with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My dear children! for whom I, again, am in birth-pains, until Christ be formed within you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I could wish, however, to be present with you, even now, and to change my voice,because I am perplexed regarding you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me! ye who, under law, are wishing to be: The law, do ye not hear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that, Abraham, had two sonsone by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But, he that was of the bondmaid, after the flesh, had been born, whereas, he that was of the free woman, through means of a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things, indeed, may bear another meaning; for, the same, are two covenants,one, indeed, from Mount Sinai, into bondage, bringing forth, the which is Hagar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>And, the Hagar, is Mount Sinai, in Arabia,she answereth, however, unto the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But, the Jerusalem above, is free,the which is our mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is writtenBe gladdened, O barren one! that wast not giving birth, break forth and shout, thou that wast not in birth-pains,because, more, are the children of the deserted one, than of her that had the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>And, we, brethren, after the manner of Isaac, are children of a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But, just as, then, he that after the manner of the flesh had been born, did persecute him who   after the manner of the Spirit, thus, also now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But, what saith the scripture? Cast out the serving woman and her son; for in nowise shall the son of the serving woman inherit with the son of the free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a serving woman, but of the free:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>With her freedom, Christ hath made you, free. Stand fast, therefore, and do not, again, with a yoke of servitude, be held fast!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>See! I, Paul, say unto youif ye be getting circumcised, Christ will profit you, nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>Yea, I bear solemn witness again, unto every man getting circumcised,that he is, a debtor, to do, the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Ye have been set aside from Christ, ye who, by law, are to be declared righteous,out of his favour, ye have fallen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For, we, in Spirit, by faith, for a hope of righteousness, are ardently waiting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For, in Christ  Jesus , neither, circumcision, availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith, through love, energising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye were running well:who hath hindered you, that, by truth, ye are not to be persuaded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>The persuasion,   not of him that calleth you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven, leaveneth, the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I, am persuaded regarding you, in the Lordthat, for nothing else, ye will have any regard; but, he that is troubling you, shall bear the sentence,whosoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>I, however, brethrenif, circumcision, I yet proclaim, why am I yet persecuted? After all, the stumbling-block of the cross hath been set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>Oh! that they would even leave off in dismay, who are unsettling you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For, ye, on a footing of freedom, were called, brethren,only,   not your freedom into an occasion to the flesh, but, by means of your love, be serving one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For, the whole law, in one word, is summed up  in this,Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>If, however, one another, ye bite and devour, take heed lest, by one another, ye be consumed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>I say, moreoverby Spirit, be walking, and, fleshly coveting, ye will in nowise fulfil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For, the flesh, coveted against the Spirit, but, the Spirit, against the flesh,for, these, unto one another, are opposed, lest, whatsoever things ye chance to desire, these, ye should be doing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>And, if, by Spirit, ye are being led, ye are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Manifest, however, are the works of the flesh, which, indeed, arefornication, impurity, wantonness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, enchantment, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of wrath, factions, divisions, parties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envyings, drunkenness, revellings;and such things as these: as to which I forewarn you, even as I have forewarned you,that, they who such things as these do practise, shall not inherit, Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But, the fruit of the Spirit, islove, joy, peace, long-suffering, graciousness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, self-control;against such things as these, there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And, they who are of Christ Jesus, have crucified, the flesh, with its susceptibilities and covetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by Spirit, by Spirit, let us also walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become vain-glorious,one another, challenging, one another, envying.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren! if a man should even be overtaken in any fault, ye, the spiritual, be restoring such a one, in a spirit of meekness, looking to thyself, lest, even thou, be put to the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>One anothers burdens, be ye bearing, and, so, fill up the law of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For, if any one thinketh he is something, when he is, nothing, he deceiveth himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But, his own work, let each one be putting to the proof, and, then, for himself alone, the matter of boasting, shall he have, and not for some other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For, each one, his own proper load, shall bear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Howbeit, let him who is being orally instructed in the word, have fellowship with him that is so instructing him, in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceiving yourselves! God, is not to be mocked; for, whatsoever a man soweth, the same, shall he also reap,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>Because, he that soweth into his own flesh, out of the flesh, shall reap corruption, whereas, he that soweth into the Spirit, out of the Spirit, shall reap age-abiding life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And, in doing that which is honourable, let us not be fainthearted; for, in due season, we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>Hence, then, as we have opportunity, let us be working what is good, towards all,but, especially, towards the family of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See! with what large letters, unto you, I have written, with my own hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as are wishing to make a good show in flesh, the same, are compelling you to get circumcised,only that, for the cross of Christ  Jesus , they may not be suffering persecution!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For, not even they who are getting circumcised, are, themselves, observing law,but are wishing you to be circumcised, that, in your flesh, they may boast themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>With me, however, far be it! to be boasting, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,whereby, unto me, a world hath been crucified, and, I, unto a world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And, as many as, by this rule, shall walk, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>For the rest, annoyances, unto me, let no one be offering; for, I, the brandmarks of Jesus, in my body, am bearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
