      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <title>And she saidAbide, my daughter, until that thou get to know, how the matter will fall out,for the man will not rest, except he have finished the thing to-day.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>And there was a certain man, of Ramathaim-zuphi, of the hill country of Ephraim,whose name, was Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>and, he, had two wives, the name of the one, Hannah, and, the name of the other, Peninnah,and Peninnah had children, but, Hannah, had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>So then that man went up, out of his city, from time to time, to worship and to sacrifice unto Yahweh of hosts, in Shiloh,and, there, were the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And, when the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he used to give, to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>and, unto Hannah, used he to give one portion,howbeit, Hannah, he loved, although, Yahweh, had restrained her from having children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival used even to cause her great vexation, for the sake of provoking her,because Yahweh had restrained her from having children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And, thus, used she to do, year by year, whenever she went up to the house of Yahweh, thus, used she to vex her,and she wept, and would not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>So Elkanah her husband said to herHannah! wherefore shouldst thou weep? and wherefore wilt thou not eat? and wherefore should thy heart be sad? Am, I, not better to thee, than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>And Hannah rose up, after she had eaten in Shiloh, and after she had drunk,and, Eli the priest, was sitting upon his chair, by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>and, she being in bitterness of soul, prayed unto Yahweh, and, wept sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and saidYahweh of hosts! If thou wilt, look, upon the humiliation of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then will I give him unto Yahweh, all the days of his life, and no, razor, shall come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And so it was, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli was watching her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>But as for, Hannah, she, was speaking in her heart, only her lips, were moving, but, her voice, could not be heard,so Eli thought she had been drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said unto her, How long, wilt thou be, drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah responded and saidNay! my lord; A woman depressed in spirit, am I: neither wine nor strong drink, have I drunk,but I poured out my soul, before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Do not count thy handmaid for an abandoned woman,for, out of the abundance of my grief and my vexation, have I spoken, hitherto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then responded Eli, and saidGo and prosper! And the, God of Israel, grant thy petition which thou hast asked of him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said: Let thy serving-woman find favour, in thine eyes. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and, her countenance, was sad no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up early in the morning, and worshipped before Yahweh, and returned, and entered their own house, in Ramah,and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Yahweh remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And so it was, when the days had come round during which Hannah was with child, that she bare a son,and called his name Samuel, Because, of Yahweh, I asked him. \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up, to offer unto Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and   his own vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But, Hannah, went not up,for she said to her husband  till the boy is weaned, then will I take him, and he shall appear before Yahweh, and abide there evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to herDo what is good in thine own eyes, tarry until thou have weaned him, only may Yahweh establish his word! So the woman tarried, and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>Then took she him up with her, when she had weaned him, with a bullock of three years old, and one ephah of meal, and a skin of wine, and took him to the house of Yahweh, at Shiloh,the boy yet being young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>So they slew the bullock,and took the boy in, unto Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she saidPardon, my lord! By the life of thy soul, my lord,I, am the woman who was standing near thee here, praying unto Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this boy, I prayed,And Yahweh hath given me my petition which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Hence, I also, have loaned him unto Yahweh, all the days that he liveth. He, is lent unto Yahweh. And he bowed down there, unto Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>Then prayed Hannah, and said, My heart hath leaped for joy in Yahweh, My horn is exalted in Yahweh, My mouth is opened wide, oer my foes, Because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy like Yahweh, Nay! there, is none, except Thee, Nor, is, there a rock, like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Do not multiply words, so loftilyloftily, Nor let arrogance proceed from your mouth,For, a GOD of knowledge, is Yahweh, And, for himself, are great doings made firm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow of the mighty, is dismayed,While, the fainting, are girded with strength;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>The sated, have, for bread, taken hire, But, the famished, have left off their toil,So that, the barren, hath given birth unto seven, While, she that hath many sons, languisheth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>Yahweh, doth kill, and make alive,Taketh down to hades, and bringeth up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>Yahweh, maketh poor, and enricheth,Layeth low, yea exalteth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>Raiseth, from the dust, the poor, From the dunghill, uplifteth the needy, To give them a dwelling with nobles, And, a throne of glory, to make them inherit. For, to Yahweh, belong the pillars of the earth, And he setteth thereon the habitable world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>The feet of his loving ones, he doth guard, But, the lawless, in darkness shall be silent,For, by strength, shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>As for Yahweh,they shall be shattered who contend with him, Over him, in the heavens will he thunder, Yahweh, will judge the ends of the earth,That he may give strength to his King, And exalt the horn of his Anointed One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>Then went Elkanah to Ramah, unto his own house,but, the boy, remained ministering unto Yahweh, before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now, the sons of Eli, were abandoned men,they knew not Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And, the custom of the priests with the people, waswhen any man offered a sacrifice, then would come the priests young man, as the flesh was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and would strike it into the boiler, or into the trough, or into the kettle, or into the pot, all that the fork would bring up, the priest took for himself. Thus and thus, used they to do unto all Israel, who came thither, in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also, before any could make perfume with the fat, the priests young man would come in and say to the person who was sacrificing, Come! give flesh for the priests roastings,for he will not take of thee boiled fleshonly raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And, if the man said to him, Let them at least, make incense, at once with the fat, then take thou as much as thy soul craveth, Then said he to him, But, at once, shalt thou give it; or else, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And so it was, that, the sin of the young men, was exceeding great, before Yahweh,for men scorned the offerings of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But, as for Samuel, he was ministering before Yahweh,a boy girded with an ephod of linen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Also, a little robe, used his mother to make for him, and bring it up to him, from year to year,when she came up with her husband, to offer the sacrifice of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli used to bless Elkanah and his wife, and to sayYahweh give thee seed of this woman, instead of the loan that hath been lent unto Yahweh. So they went their way to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons, and two daughters. Thus did the boy Samuel grow up with Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now, Eli, was very old,but he used to hear all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how they even lay with the women who did service, at the opening of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>So he said to them, Wherefore should ye do such things as these? for I keep hearing of your wicked doings, from all these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Nay, my sons! for it is no good report that I do hear: leading into transgression the people of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, God will interpose, but, if, against Yahweh, a man sin, who will intercede, for him? But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, for Yahweh was pleased to put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>But, the boy Samuel, went on growing in stature, and in favour,both with Yahweh, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God, unto Eli,and said unto himThus, saith Yahweh, I, did indeed reveal myself, unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, as servants unto the house of Pharaoh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>choosing him out of all the tribes of Israel unto myself, to minister as priest, to offer upon mine altar, to perfume with incense to bear an ephod before me,Therefore gave I unto the house of thy father all the altar-flames of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore have ye been kicking at my sacrifices, and my presents, which I commanded, to serve for a home,and shouldest have honoured thy sons more than me: fattening yourselves, with the first of every present of Israel, before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Hence, the oracle of Yahweh God of Israel, I, said, that, thy house, and the house of thy father, should go to and fro in my presence, unto times age-abiding: But, now, (is the oracle of Yahweh)Be it far from me! For, them who honour me, will I honour, but, they who despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Lo! days are coming, when I will hew off thine arm, and the arm of the house of thy father,that there shall be no elder in thy house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>But thou shalt descry distress at home, in all that shall gladden Israel,and there shall not be an elder in thine own house, all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>But, any man of thine whom I may not cut off from mine altar, it shall beto consume his eyes, and grieve his soul; Howbeit, all the multitude of thy house, shall die, by the sword of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And, this, for thee is the sign, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas,In one day, shall they, both of them, die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, According to that which is in my heart and in my soul, will he do; Therefore will I build for him an assured house, and he shall go to and fro in presence of mine Anointed, all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall be, that, any that is left in thy house, shall come bowing down to him for a small coin of silver, and for a cake of bread, and shall say: Appoint me, I pray thee, to one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>Now, the boy Samuel, was ministering unto Yahweh, before Eli,and, the word of Yahweh, had become rare in those days, there was no well-known vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>But it came to pass, at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, his eyes, having begun to be dim, he could not see,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>though, the lamp of God, was not yet to be put out, and, Samuel, was lying down in the temple of Yahweh, where was the ark of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>that Yahweh called unto Samuel, and he saidBehold me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>So he ran unto Eli and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. And he saidI called not, returnIts down. So he went, and lie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And again Yahweh called once thereSamuel! Then rose Samuel, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. And he saidI called not, my son, returnlie down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now, Samuel, as yet knew not Yahweh,nor, as yet, had been revealed unto him, the word of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And again Yahweh calledSamuel! a third time. Then he arose, and went unto Eli, and saidBehold me! for thou calledst me. Then did Eli perceive, that, Yahweh, was calling the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>So Eli said to SamuelGo, lie down, and it shall be, if he call unto thee, that thou shalt saySpeak, Yahweh, for thy servant is listening. And Samuel went, and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>Then came Yahweh, and stood, and called as time after timeSamuel! Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant is listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And Yahweh said unto Samuel, Lo! I am doing a thing, in Israel,at which both ears of everyone that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day, will I confirm against Eli, all that I have spoken against his house,beginning and finishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>Therefore do I tell him, that I am about to judge his house unto times age-abiding, for the iniquity which he knoweth, in that his sons are cursing God, and he hath not rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore have I sworn, respecting the house of Eli,that the iniquity of the house of Eli shall receive no propitiatory-covering, by sacrifice or by present, unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh,but, Samuel, feared to tell the appearing, unto Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>So Eli called Samuel, and saidSamuel! my son. And he saidBehold me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he saidWhat is the word, which he spake unto thee? I pray thee, do not hide it from me. So, let God do to thee, and, so, let him add, if thou hide from me a word, out of anything which he hath spoken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>So Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And he said, Yahweh, he is; what is good in his own eyes, let him do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew,and, Yahweh, proved to he with him, and let none of all his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>So all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, came to know,that Samuel had become confirmed as a prophet unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>Thus did Yahweh again appear in Shiloh,for Yahweh had revealed himself unto Samuel in Shiloh, in the word of Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And so it was, when the word of Samuel had reached all Israel, that Israel went forth to meet the Philistines in battle, and they encamped near Eben-ezer, while, the Philistines, encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines set themselves in array to meet Israel, and, when the battle spread, then was Israel smitten before the Philistines,and there were slain of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And, when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Yahweh smitten us to-day, before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us, out of Shiloh, the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that, when it cometh into our midst, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and bare from thence the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts, who inhabiteth the cherubim,and, there, were the two sons of Eli, with the ark of the covenant of God, namely, Hophni and Phinehas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And so it was, when the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, that all Israel brake out into a loud shout of joy,so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And, when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they saidWhat meaneth the noise of this loud shout of joy in the camp of the Hebrews? And they learned that, the ark of Yahweh, had come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they saidGod hath come into the camp. And they saidWoe to us! for there hath not happened the like of this, heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who shall rescue us out of the hand of these majestic gods? These, are the gods, who smote the Egyptians with all manner of smiting in the desert!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Take courage, and quit yourselves like men, ye Philistines, lest ye come into bondage to the Hebrews, as they have been in bondage unto you,therefore must ye quit yourselves like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his home; and the slaughter became exceeding great,and there fell of Israelthirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And, the ark of God, was taken,and, the two sons of Eli, were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and entered Shiloh on the same day,with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And, when he entered, lo! Eli was sitting upon his chair, by the wayside, watching, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God,and, the man, entered to tell the news in the city, and all the city made outcry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And, when Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he saidWhat meaneth the noise of this tumult? And, the man, hasted, and came, and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now, Eli, was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were fixed, that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>So the man said unto Eli, I, am he that came in from the army, yea, I, from the army, fled to-day. And he saidWhat is the thing that hath happened, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the bearer of tidings answered, and saidIsrael hath fled before the Philistines, Moreover also, a great smiting, hath taken place among the people,Moreover also, thy two sons, are slain, Hophni and Phinehas, And, the ark of God, is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backwards, at the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died, for, old, was the man, and, heavy,and, he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>Now, his daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, was with child, ready to give birth, and, when she heard the tidings, as to the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law, and her husband, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her pains had seized her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And, about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said: Do not fear, for, to a son, hast thou given birth. But she neither answered nor regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she called the boy I-chabod! saying, Exiled is the glory from Israel,In regard to the taking of the ark of God, and to her father-in-law, and to her husband. \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>So she saidExiled is the glory from Israel,For the ark of God hath been taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>Now, the Philistines, having taken the ark of God,brought it in from Eben-ezer, unto Ashdod.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>So then Saul called together the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen,and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>And Saul came as far as the city of Amalek,and stirred up strife in the ravine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.10'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Samuel, saying</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>I am grieved that I made Saul to be king, for he hath turned back from following me, and, my words, hath he not established. And it was vexing to Samuel, so that he made outcry unto Yahweh, all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.12'>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul, in the morning, and it was told Samuel, sayingSaul having come to Carmel, and lo! having set him up a sign, hath gone round, and passed over, and descended to Gilgal.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.8'>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel,and he said, Neither of this one, hath Yahweh made choice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.6'>But so it was, when they came in on the return of David from the smiting of the Philistine, that the women went forth out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet Saul the king,with timbrels, with rejoicing, and with instruments of three strings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.7'>And the women that made merry responded to each other in song, and said,Saul, hath smitten, his thousands, but, David, his, tens of thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.8'>Then was Saul exceeding angry, and this saying was offensive in his eyes, and he said,They have ascribed, to David, ten thousands, but, to me, have they ascribed thousands,What, more, then, can he have but, the kingdom?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.9'>And Saul was eyeing David from that day forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.10'>And, when it came to pass, on the morrow, that a superhuman spirit of sadness came suddenly upon Saul, and he was moved to raving in the midst of the house,and, David, began playing with his hand, as he had done day by day, that a spear being in Sauls hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.11'>Saul hurled the spear, and said to himselfI will smite David, even to the wall! But David moved round from before him, twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.12'>And Saul feared because of David,for Yahweh was with him, whereas, from Saul, he had departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.13'>So Saul removed him from him, and appointed him to be for him the captain of a thousand,and he went out and came in before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.14'>And it came to pass that David, in all his ways, acted prudently,and, Yahweh, was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.15'>And, when Saul saw that, he, was acting very prudently, he was afraid of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.16'>But, all Israel and Judah, were in love with David,for he was going out and coming in before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.17'>So then Saul said unto DavidLo! my elder daughter Merab, her, will I give thee to wife, only, approve thyself unto me as a son of valour and fight the battles of Yahweh. Saul, however, had said to himselfLet not, my own hand, be upon him, but let, the hand of the Philistines, be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.18'>And David said unto SaulWho am, I, or who are my kinsfolk, the family of my father, in Israel,that I should become son-in-law, to the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.19'>But it came to pass, within the time for giving Merab daughter of Saul to David, that, she, was given to Adriel the Meholathite, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.20'>Then did Michal, Sauls daughter, love David,and it was told Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.21'>And Saul said to himselfI will give her unto him, that she may prove to him a snare, and that, the hand of the Philistines, may be upon him. So then Saul said unto David, A second time, mayest thou become my son-in-law to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.22'>And Saul commanded his servantsSpeak ye unto David quietly saying, Lo! the king delighteth in thee, and, all his servants, love thee,now, therefore, become thou son-in-law to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.23'>And the servants of Saul spake, in the ears of David, these words. And David saidSeemeth it a light thing, in your eyes, to become son-in-law to the king, seeing that, I, am a poor man and lightly esteemed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.24'>So the servants of Saul told him, saying,According to these words, spake David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.25'>Then said SaulThus, shall ye say unto DavidThe king hath no delight in purchase-price, but rather in a hundred foreskins of Philistines, by avenging himself on the enemies of the king. But, Saul, thought to let David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.26'>So, when his servants told David these words, the thing was right in the eyes of David, to become son-in-law unto the king,and the days had not expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.27'>Wherefore David arose, and wenthe and his men, and smote among the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought in their foreskins, and gave them in full tale unto the king, that he might become son-in-law unto the king, and Saul gave him Michal his daughter, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.28'>And Saul saw and knew that, Yahweh, was with David, and that, all Israel, loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.29'>So then Saul went on to fear because of David, yet more,and it came to pass that Saul was hostile to David, all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.30'>And, when the princes of the Philistines came forth, so it was, that, as often as they came forth, David was more circumspect than any of the servants of Saul, so that his name was, precious exceedingly.</verse>
