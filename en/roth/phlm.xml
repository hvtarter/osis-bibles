        <title>As to these things, be speaking and exhorting and reproving, with all manner of precept: let, no one, disregard thee!</title>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy my brother,unto Philemon the beloved, and a fellow worker of ours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And unto Apphia our sister. And unto Archippus our fellow-soldier, and unto the assembly which meeteth, at thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I am giving thanks unto my Godalways, making mention, of thee, in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus and towards all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>To the end that, the fellowship of thy faith, may become, energetic, by a personal knowledge of every good thing that is in us towards Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For, much joy, have I had, and encouragement, by occasion of thy love, in that, the tender affections of the saints, have had rest given them by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, though I have, much, freedom of speech, in Christ, to be enjoining upon thee that which is befitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet, for loves sake, I rather exhort,being, such a one, as Paul the aged, now, also, even a prisoner of Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I exhort thee concerning my own child, whom I have begotten in my bonds,Onesimus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Him who, at one time, was, unto thee, unserviceable, but, now, unto thee and unto me, serviceable;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent back unto theehim, that is, my own, tender affections!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom, I, was minded, with myself, to detain, that, in thy behalf, unto me, he might be ministering in the bonds of the joyful message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But, apart from thy mind, I wished to do, nothing, that, not as by necessity, thy goodness should be, but, by choice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For, peradventure, for this cause, was he separated for an hour, that, as an age-abiding possession, thou mightest have him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>No longer as a servant, but above a servanta brother beloved, very greatly to me, but, how much rather, to theeboth in the flesh and in the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If, therefore, thou holdest me as one in thy fellowship, take him unto thee, as myself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>And, if he hath wronged thee at all or oweth thee aught, the same, unto me, do thou reckon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, have written   ; that I may not tell theethat, thyself, unto me, thou still owest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea! brother, I, would, from thee, have help, in the Lord: give rest unto my tender affections in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Confident of thine obedience, I have written unto thee, knowing that, even beyond what I say, thou wilt do:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time, moreover, be also getting ready for me, a lodging; for I am hoping that, through your prayers, I shall be granted as a favour unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There salute theeEpaphras my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke,my fellow-workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The favour of the Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit.</verse>
