        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>Now, the earth, had become waste and wild, and darkness, was on the face of the roaring deep,but, the Spirit of God, was brooding on the face of the waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God saidLight, be, And light was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was, good, and God divided the light, from the, darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>and God called the light, day, but the darkness, called he, night. So it was eveningand it was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a means of dividing, between waters and waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the expanse, and it divided between the waters that were under the expanse and the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the expanse, heavens. So it was eveningand it was morning, a, second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God saidLet the waters under the heavens be gathered together, into one place, and let the dryground appear. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called, the dry-ground, land, but the gathering together of the waters, called he seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God saidLet the land put-forth vegetation-herb yielding seed, fruit-tree, bearing fruit, after its kind, whose seed is within it on the land. And it was so,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the land brought-forth vegetationherb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, whose seed is within it, after its kind, And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>So it was eveningand it was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God saidLet there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night,and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>yea let them be for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great luminaries,the greater luminary to rule the day, and the lesser luminary to rule the night, also the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens,to give light on the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>So it was eveningand it was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God saidLet the waters swarm with an abundance of living soul, and, birds, shall fly over the earth, over the face of the expanse of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great sea-monsters,and every living soul that moveth  which the waters swarmed after their kind and every winged birdafter its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying,Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let, the birds, multiply in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>So it was eveningand it was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God saidLet the land, bring forth, living soul, after its kind, tame-beast and creeping thing and wild-beast, of the land, after its kind. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the wild-beast of the land after its kind, and the tame-beast after its kind, and every creeping thing of the ground, after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God saidLet us make man in our image after our likenessand let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the bird of the heavens and over the tame-beastand over all the land, and over every creeping thing, that creepeth on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created the man in his own image, In the image of God, created he him,Male and female, created he, them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, and God said to them Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it,and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the bird of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God saidLo! I have given to youevery herb yielding seed which is on the face of all the land, and every tree wherein is the fruit of a tree yielding seed,to you, shall it be, for food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every living thing of the landand to every bird of the heavens, and to every thing that moveth on the land, wherein is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it wins so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw every thing which he had made, and lo! it was very good. So it was eveningand it was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus were finished the heavens and the earth and all their host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>Thus God finished, on the seventh day his work which he had made, and rested, on the seventh day, from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it,because therein, rested he from all his work which God, by creating, had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the geneses of the heavens and the earth when they were created,in the day when Yahweh God made earth and heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>Now, no bush of the field, as yetwas in the earth, and, no herb of the field, as yet had sprung up,because Yahweh God had not sent rain on the earth, and, man, was there none to till the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but, a vapour, went up from the earth,and watered all the face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>So then Yahweh God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed in his nostrils the breath of lifeand man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Yahweh God planted a garden in Eden, on the east,and put there the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And Yahweh God, caused to spring up, out of the ground, every tree pleasant to the sight and good for food,and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>Now, a river, was coming forth out of Eden, to water the garden,and, from thence, it parted, and became four heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the one, is Pishon,the same, is that which surroundeth all the land of Havilah, where is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>moreover the gold of that and, is good,there, is the bdellium, and the beryl stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river, is Gihon,the same, is that which surroundeth all the land of Cush,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And, the name of the third river, is Hiddekel, the same, is that which goeth in front of Assyria; and the fourth river, is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>So Yahweh God took the man,and placed him in the garden of Eden, to till it and to keeps it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Yahweh God laid command on the man, saying,Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not cat of it,for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shelf die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Yahweh God said, It is, not good, that the man should remain alone,I will make for him a helper as his counterpart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>Now Yahweh God had formed from the ground every living thing of the field and every bird of the heavens, which he brought in unto the man, that he might see what he should call it,and, whatsoever the man should call itany living soul, that, should be the name thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>So the man gave names to all the tame-beasts, and to the birds of the heavens, and to all the wild-beasts of the field,but, for man, had there not been found a helper as his counterpart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept,and he took one of his ribs, and closed up flesh instead thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And Yahweh God builded the rib which he had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her in unto the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said, This, one, now, is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh! This, one shall be called Woman, for, out of a man, hath this one been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>For this cause, will a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both of them naked, the man and his wife,and put not each other to shame.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now, the serpent, was more crafty than any living thing of the field which Yahweh God had made, so he said unto the woman, Can it really be that God hath said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said unto the serpent,Of the fruit of the trees of the garden, we may eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it,lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said unto the woman,Ye shall not die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then shall your eyes be opened,and ye shall become like God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And, when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was desirable to the eyes and the tree was pleasant to make one knowing, then took she of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and she gave to her husband also, along with her, and he did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>Then were opened the eyes of them both, and they knew that, naked, they were,so they tacked together fig-leaves, and made for themselves girdles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>Then heard they the sound of Yahweh God, walking to and fro in the garden at the breeze of the day,so he hid himselfthe man with his wife, from the face of Yahweh God, amid the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Yahweh God called unto the man,and said to him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, The sound of thee, heard I in the garden, and I was afraid, for, naked, was I, so I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that, naked, thou wast? Of the tree whereof I commanded thee not to eat, hast thou eaten?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said,The woman whom thou didst put with me, she, gave me of the tree, so I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>Then said Yahweh God to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, the serpent, deceived me, so I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>Then said Yahweh God unto the serpentBecause thou hast done this, Accursed, art thou above every tame-beast, and above every wild-beast of the field,on thy belly, shall thou go, and dust, shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And enmity, will I put between thee, and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed,He shall crush thy head, but, thou, shalt crush his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Unto the woman, he said, I will, increase, thy pain of pregnancy, In pain, shalt thou year children,Yet, unto thy husband, shall be thy hinging, Though, he, rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And, to the man, he said, Because thou didst hearken to the voice of thy wife, and so didst eat of the tree as to which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, Accursed be the ground for thy sake, In pain, shalt thou eat of it, all the days of thy life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Thorn also and thistle, shall it shoot forth to thee,when thou hast come to eat of the herb of the field:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face, shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground, because therefrom, wast thou taken,For, dust, thou art, And, unto dust, shalt thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>So the man called the name of his wife, Eve,in that, she, was made mother of every one living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And Yahweh God made for the manand for his wifetunics of skin and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>Then said Yahweh GodLo! man, hath become like one of us, in respect of knowing good and evil,Now, therefore, lest he thrust forth his hand, and take even of the tree of life, and eat, and live to times age-abiding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>So Yahweh God put him forth from the garden of Eden,to till the ground wherefrom he had been taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he expelled the man,and caused to dwellin front of the garden of Edencherubim and a brandishing swordflame, to keep the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>Now, the man, having come to know Eve his wife,she conceived and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a Man, even Yahweh!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And she went on to hear his brother, Abel,and Abel became a feeder of sheep, whereas Cain, was a tiller of the round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>So it came to pass, after certain days, that Cain brought in of the fruit of the ground, a present to Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Abel, also, even, he, brought in of the firstlings of his sheep, and of their fat, and Yahweh approved of Abel and of his present;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but of Cain and his present, he approved not,and it angered Cain greatly, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>So then Yahweh said unto Cain,Wherefore hath it angered thee, and wherefore hath thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>Shall it not, if thou do right, be lifted up? But if thou do not right, at the entrance a sin-bearer is lying,Unto thee, moreover, shall be his longing, though, thou, rule over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain said unto Abel his brother Let us go into the field And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>Then said Yahweh unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said know not, the keeper of my brother, am, I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What hast thou done? With a voice, the shed-blood of thy brother is crying out to me from the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>Now therefore, accursed, art thou,from the ground which hath opened her mouth, to receive the shed-blood of thy brother at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>Though thou till the ground, it shall not go on to give its vigour to thee. A wanderer and a fugitive, shalt thou be in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said unto YahwehGreater is my punishment than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Lo! thou has driven me out, this day, from off the face of the ground And from thy face, shall I be hid, So shall I become a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth. And it shall come to pass, whosoever findeth me, will slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Yahweh said to himNot so, whosoever slayeth Cain sevenfold, shall it be avenged. So Yahweh set, for Cain, a sign, that none finding him should smite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>So Cain went forth from the presence of Yahweh,and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bare Enoch,Now it happened that he was building a city, so he called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And there was born to Enoch Irad, and, Irad, begat Mehujael,and Mehujael, begat Methusael,and Methusael, begat Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took to himself two wives,the name of the one, was Adah, and, the name of the second Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bare Jabal,he, was father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>and, the name of his brother, was Jubal,he, was father of everyone handling lyre and flute,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And, as for Zillah, she also, bare Tubal-Cain, a sharpener of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron,and, the sister of Tubal-Cain, was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>Then said Lamech to his wives, Adah and Zillah! hear ye my voice, Ye wives of Lamech! give ear to my tale, For a man, have I slain in dealing my wounds, Yea, a youth, in smiting my blows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If, sevenfold, be, the avenging of Cain, Then, of Lamech, seventy and seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam again knew his wife, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth,For God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Sethto him also, was born a son, and he called his name Enosh,then, was a beginning made, to call on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This, is the record of the generations of Adam. In the day when God created man, In the likeness of God, made he him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>Male and female, created he them,and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day they were created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat   in his likeness after his image,and called his name Seth:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.26.7'>Then asked the men of the place as to his wife, and he said, My sister, is she,For he feared to say My wife, lest   the men of the place should slay me on account of Rebekah, for fair to Nook on, she is.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.2'>and put the handmaids and their children first,and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph next;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.3'>but he himself, passed over before them, and bowed himself to the earth seven times, until he had come near unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.4'>Then ran Esau to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,and they wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.5'>Then lifted he up his eyes, and beheld the women and the children, and said What are these to thee? And he saidThe children wherewith God hath favoured thy servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.6'>Then came near the handmaids, theyand their children,and bowed themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.7'>Then came near Leah also with her children,and they bowed themselves. And afterwards, came near Joseph with Rachel, and they bowed themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.8'>Then said he, What to thee is all this camp, which I have fallen in with? And he said,To find favour in the eyes of my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.9'>Then said Esau, I have an abundance,my brother, be thine what thou hast!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.10'>Then said Jacob, Nay, I pray thee, if, I pray thee, have found favour in thine eyes, then thou wilt take my present at my hand,For on this account, hath my seeing thy face been like seeing the face of God in that thou wast well-pleased with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.11'>Take, I pray thee my blessing which hath been brought in to thee, because God hath shewed me favour and because I have everything. So he was urgent with him and he took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.12'>Then he said, Let us break up and go, and let me go on before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.13'>And he said unto him, My lord, is taking note, that, the children are tender,and the flocks and the herds are giving suck with me,and, should I overdrive them a single day, then would all the flocks die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.14'>Let my lord, I pray thee pass over before his servant, and let, me, lead on in my own easy way, at the pace of the cattle that are before me, and at the pace of the children, until that I come in unto my lord, towards Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.15'>Then said Esau: Let me leave, I pray thee, along with thee, some of the people who are with me! And he saidWhy so? let me find favour in the eyes of my lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.16'>So Esau returned, that day, to his journey towards Mount Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.17'>But, Jacob, brake up towards Succoth, and built for himself a house, for his cattle, made he places of shelter, for which cause, the name of the place was called, Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.18'>And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan,when he came in from Padan-aram,and he encamped before the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.19'>And he bought the portion of the field where he had spread out his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem,for a hundred kesitahs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.20'>And he set up there an altar,and called it, El-elohe-Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.34'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.1'>Then went forth Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob,to see the daughters of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.2'>And Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the lend, saw her,so he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.3'>And his soul clave unto Dinah, daughter of Jacob,and he loved the young woman, and spake to the heart of the young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.4'>Then spake Shechem unto Hamor his father, saying,Take me this girl to wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.5'>Now, Jacob, had heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, but, his sons, happened to be with his cattle in the field,so Jacob kept quiet until they came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.6'>Then came forth Hamor, father of Shechem, unto Jacob,to speak with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.7'>Now the sons of Jacob came in from the field as soon as they heard, and the men were grieved, and it was vexing to them exceedingly,for, a disgraceful deed, had he done with Israel in lying with Jacobs daughter, seeing that so, it should not be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.8'>So then Hamor spake with them sayingAs for Shechem my son, his soul hath be-come attached to your daughter,I pray you give her to him, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.9'>And exchange ye daughters with us in marriage,your daughters, shall ye give to us, and our daughters, shall ye take to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.10'>And with us, stroll ye dwell,and, the land, shall be before you, tarry, and go through it, and get possessions therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.11'>Then said Shechem unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favour in your eyes,and, whatsoever ye may say unto me, will I give:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.12'>Heap on me, exceedingly, dowry and gift, and I will give, just as ye may say unto me,but give me the young woman, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.13'>And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and spake (because he had defiled Dinah their sister)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.14'>and said unto themWe cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man that is uncircumcised,for a reproach, it would be to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.15'>Only herein, can we consent to you,If ye will become like us, by circumcising to you every male,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.16'>then will we give our daughters to you, and your daughters, will we take to us,and we will dwell with you, and become one people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.17'>But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.18'>And their words looked fair in the eyes of Hamor,and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamors son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.19'>and the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacobs daughter,he, moreover being more honourable than all the house of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.20'>So Hamor entered with Shechem his son into the gate of their city,and they spake unto the men of their city, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.21'>As for these men, in peace, they are with uslet them therefore dwell in the land and go through it, for, the land, lo! it is roomy on both hands before them,their daughters, let us take to us for wives, and our daughters, let us give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.22'>Only herein, will the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people,If we circumcise to us every male, even as they are circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.23'>Their herds and their substance, and all their beasts, shall they, not be, ours? Only, we must consent to them, that they may dwell with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.24'>And they hearkened unto Hamor, and unto Shechem his son, even all that were going forth out of the gate of his city,and every male was circumcised, all that were going forth out of the gate of his city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.25'>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi, Dinahs brothers, took each man his sword, and came in upon the city, boldly,and slew every, male;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.26'>Hamor also, and Shechem his son, slew they with the edge of the sword,and took Dinah out of the house of Shechem, and came forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.27'>The sons of Jacob, came in upon the slain and plundered the city,because they had defiled their sister:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.28'>their flocks, and their herds and their asses,and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, they took;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.29'>and all their wealth and all their little ones, and their women, took they captive, and seized as plunder,even all that was in their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.30'>Then said Jacob unto Simeon and unto LeviYe have troubled me by making me odious among them that dwell in the land, among the Canaanites, and among the Perizzites,I, having only men that may be counted, they will gather themselves, together against me and smite me,and I shall be destroyed both I and my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.34.31'>And they said,As with a harlot, was he to deal with our sister.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.35'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.1'>Then said God unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there,and make there an altar, to the GOD who appeared unto thee, when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.2'>And Jacob said unto his house, and unto all who were with him,Put away the gods of the alien which are in your midst, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.3'>And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el,that I may make there an altar to the GOD who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way that I went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.4'>So they gave unto Jacob all the gods of the alien which were in their hand, and the earrings which were in their ears,and Jacob hid them under the oak, which was by Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.5'>And they brake up,and it came to pass that the terror of God, was on the cities which were round about them, so that they pursued not after the sons of Jacob.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.9'>And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came in from Padan-aram,and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.10'>And God said to him, Thy name, is Jacob,Thy name shall no longer he called Jacob But, Israel, shall be thy name. So he called his name, Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.11'>And God said to himI, am GOD Almighty! Be fruitful and multiply, A nation, and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee,And, kings, from thy loins, shall come forth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.13'>And God went up from him at the place where he had spoken with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.14'>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone,and he poured out thereon a drink-offering, and poured thereon oil.</verse>
