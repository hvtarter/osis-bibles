      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <title>on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month,in the second year of Darius the king.</title>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>Yahweh, was sore displeased, with your fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>therefore shalt thou say unto them, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Return ye unto me, urgeth Yahweh of hosts,that I may return unto you, saith Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Do not become like your fathers, unto whom the former prophets, proclaimed, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Return, I pray you, from your wicked ways, and from your wicked practices; but they heard not, nor hearkened unto me, declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where are they? and, the prophets, to times age-abiding, do they live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>Howbeit, as for my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and so they returned and said, Just as Yahweh of hosts planned to do unto us, according to our ways and according to our practices, So hath he dealt with us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the same, is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Yahweh unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, the prophet, as followeth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I looked by night, And lo! a man riding upon a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees, in the shade; and, after him, were horses, red, bay, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then said I, What are these, my lord? And the messenger who was speaking with me, said unto me, I, will shew thee what these, are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>So the man who was standing among the myrtle-trees responded, and said,These, are they whom Yahweh, hath sent, to go to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>Then responded they to the messenger of Yahweh, who was standing among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have gone to and fro through the earth,and lo! all the earth, resteth and is quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the messenger of Yahweh responded, and said, O Yahweh of hosts! How long wilt, thou, not have compassion upon Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah,against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And Yahweh answered the messenger who was speaking with me, in words that were pleasant,words that were consoling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>Then the messenger who was speaking with me, said unto me, Proclaim thou, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem, and for Zion, with a great jealousy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And, with a great displeasure, am I displeased with the careless nations,in that, when, I, was displeased (for) a little, then, they, helped forward the calamity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Wherefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, I have returned to Jerusalem, with compassions,, My house, shall be built therein, declareth Yahweh of hosts, and, a line, shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Further, proclaim thou, saying, Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Yet, shall my cities overflow with blessing! So will Yahweh yet, have compassion, upon Zion, and yet make choice of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked,and lo! Four Horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, What are these? And he said unto me, These, are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>Then Yahweh shewed me Four Craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>And I said, What are these coming in to do? And he spake, saying, These, are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head, but these</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! a Man,and, in his hand, a Measuring Line.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>And I said, Whither art thou going? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what   the breadth thereof, and what the length thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And lo! the messenger who was talking with me, coming forward,and another messenger, coming forward to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>So he said unto him, Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Like open villages, shall Jerusalem remain, for the multitude of men and cattle in her midst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>And, I, will become to her, declareth Yahweh, A wall of fire round about,and, a glory, will I become in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho! ho! flee ye, therefore, out of the land of the North, urgeth Yahweh. For, as the four winds of the heavens, have I spread you abroad, declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Ho! Zion, deliver thyself,thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. For,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, For his own honour, hath he sent me unto the nations that are spoiling you,Surely, he that toucheth you, toucheth the pupil of mine eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For behold me! brandishing my hand over them, and they shall become a spoil unto their own slaves,and ye shall know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing out and rejoice, O daughter of Zion,For behold me! coming in, and I will make my habitation in thy midst, declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>Then shall many nations, join themselves, unto Yahweh, in that day, and shall become my people,and I will make my habitation in thy midst, so shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>Thus will Yahweh inherit Judah, his portion, on the soil of the sanctuary,and make choice, yet again, of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Hush! all flesh, before Yahweh,For he hath roused himself up out of his holy dwelling.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he shewed me, Joshua the high priest, standing before the messenger of Yahweh,and, the Accuser, standing at his right hand, to accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>Then said Yahweh unto the Accuser, Yahweh rebuke thee, O Accuser, Yea Yahweh rebuke thee, he who is choosing Jerusalem,Is not, this, a brand snatched out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now, Joshua, was clothed with filthy garments,though standing before the messenger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>Then responded he and spake unto those who were standing before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him; and he said unto him, See! I have caused to pass from off thee, thine iniquity, And will cause thee to be clothed in robes of state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>Then said I, Let them put a clean turban upon his head,So they put the clean turban upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and, the messenger of Yahweh, was standing up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>So then the messenger of Yahweh did solemnly affirm unto Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, If, in my ways, thou wilt walk, and if, of my charge, thou wilt keep charge, Then, even thou, shalt govern my house, Moreover also, thou shalt have charge of my courts,and I will give thee free access among these who stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear, I pray thee, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy friends who are sitting before thee, for, men to serve as signs, they are,For behold me! bringing in my servant, the Bud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For lo! the stone which I have set before Joshua, Upon one stone, are Seven (pairs of) Eyes,Behold me! cutting the engraving thereof, declareth Yahweh of hosts. So will I take away the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, declareth Yahweh of hosts, Ye shall invite one another,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And once more the messenger who was speaking with me, roused me up, just as a man might be roused up out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>Then said he unto me, What canst thou see? And I saidI have looked, and lo! a Lampstandall of gold, with the Bowl thereof upon the top thereof, and its Seven Lamps upon it, Seven Pipes each, to the lamps which are upon the top thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>and, Two Olive-trees, by it,one upon the right hand of the bowl, and one upon the left hand thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>Then responded I, and said unto the messenger who was speaking with me, saying,What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then answered the messenger who was speaking with me, and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these, are? And I said, No my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then responded he, and spake unto me, saying, This, is the word of Yahweh, unto Zerubbabel, saying,Not by wealth, nor by strength, but by my spirit, saith Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who, art, thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel,   to a plain! So shall he bring forth the headstone, with thundering shouts Beautiful! Beautiful! thereunto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel, have founded this house, and, his hands, shall finish it,So shalt thou know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who hath despised the day of small things? Yet shall they rejoice, when they see the plummet-stone in the hand of Zerubbabel,these seven! The eyes of Yahweh, they arerunning to and fro throughout all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then responded I, and said unto him,What are these two olive-trees, upon the right of the lampstand, and upon the left thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I responded a second time, and said unto him,What are the two branches of the olive- trees which join the two golden tubes, which empty out of them the golden oil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he spake unto me, saying, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then said he, These, are the two Anointed Ones,who stand near the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>And once more lifted I mine eyes, and looked,and lo! a Flying Volume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said unto me, What canst thou see? So I said, I, can see a flying volume, the length thereof, twenty by the cubit, and, the breadth thereof, ten by the cubit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then said he unto me, This, is the curse, which is going forth over the face of all the earth,Because, every one who stealeth, on the one side, hath in one way been let off, and, every one who sweareth, on the other side, hath in another way been let off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>fehlt</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then came forward, the messenger who was talking with me,and said unto meLift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see what this is which is coming forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? Then said he, This, is an ephah that is coming forth. And he said, This, is their iniquity, throughout all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And lo! a leaden disc uplifted,and here a certain woman, sitting inside the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>Then said he, This, is Lawlessness. So he thrust her back inside the ephah,and then thrust the leaden weight into the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then lifted I up mine eyes and looked, and lo! Two Women coming forward, with the wind in their wings, and, they, had wings, like the wings of the stork,and bare up the ephah, between the earth and the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then said I unto the messenger who was speaking with me,Whither are they carrying the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said unto me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar,so shall it be ready, and they shall settle it there, upon its own base?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And once again I lifted mine eyes, and looked, and lo! four chariots, coming forward from between two mountains,now, the mountains, were mountains of copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot, were red horses,and, in the second chariot, black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>and, in the third chariot, white horses,and, in the fourth chariot, horses spotted, deep red.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then began I, and said, unto the messenger who was speaking with me,What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the messenger answered, and said unto me,These, are the four winds of the heavens, coming forward after each hath presented itself near the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>They in whose chariot are the black horses, are going forth into the land of the North, and, the white, have gone forth after them,and, the spotted, have gone forth into the land of the South;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>and, the deep red, have come forward and sought to go their way, that they might journey to and fro in the land, so he said, Go your way, journey to and fro in the land,and they journeyed to and fro in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then made he outcry beside me, and spake unto me, saying,See, these who are going forth into the land of the North, have settled my spirit in the land of the North.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of them of the exile, of Heldai, and of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah,then shalt, thou thyself, enter, on that day, yea thou shalt enter the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah,   who have come in out of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>yea thou shalt take silver and gold, and make a crown,and set   upon the head of Jehoshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>then shalt thou speak unto him, saying, Thus, speaketh Yahweh of hosts, saying,Lo! a man! Bud, is his name, and, out of his own place, shall he bud forth, and shall build the temple of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Yea, he, shall build the temple of Yahweh, and, he, shall bear the honour, and shall sit and rule upon his throne,and shall become a priest upon his throne, and, the counsel of peace, shall be between the two of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>But, the crown, shall belong to Heldai and to Tobiah and to Jedaiah, and to Hen son of Zephaniah,for a memorial in the temple of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And, they who are afar off, shall come in and shall build at the temple of Yahweh, so shall yea know that, Yahweh of hosts, hath sent me unto you,and it shall come to pass if ye will, indeed hearken, unto the voice of Yahweh your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass, in the fourth year of Darius the king, that the word of Yahweh came unto Zechariah, on the fourth of the ninth month, in Chisleu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>yea when Bethel sent Sherezer and Regemmelech, and his men,to pacify the face of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>to speak unto the priests that pertained to the house of Yahweh of hosts, and unto the prophets, saying,Shall I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then came the word of Yahweh of hosts unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak thou unto all the people of the land, and unto the priests, saying,When ye fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh, even these seventy years, did ye, really fast, unto, me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And, when ye used to eat and when ye used to drink, was it not, of your own accord, ye did eat, and, of your own accord, ye did drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Should ye not</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of Yahweh came unto Zechariah, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus, spake Yahweh of hosts, saying,With true justice, give ye judgment, and, lovingkindness and compassions, observe ye, one with another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And, the widow and the fatherless, the sojourner and the humbled, do not ye oppress,and, wickedness between one man and another, do not ye devise in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>Howbeit they refused to give heed, but put forth a rebellious shoulder,and, their ears, made they hard of hearing, that they might not hear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>and, their heart, turned they into adamant, that they might not hear the law, nor the words which Yahweh of hosts sent by his spirit, through the former prophets,and so there came great wrath from Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>Therefore came it to pass thatjust as he cried out and they hearkened not, so, used they to cry out, and I used not to hearken, saith Yahweh of hosts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>But I whirled them over all the nations whom they had not known, and, the land, was made desolate after them, that none passed through and returned,Yea they made of a delightful landa desolation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>And the word of Yahweh of hosts came, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, I am jealous for Zion with a great jealousy,Yea, with great wrath, am I jealous for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus, saith Yahweh, I have returned unto Zion, and will make my habitation in the midst of Jerusalem,and Jerusalem, shall be called, The city of fidelity, and the mountain of Yahweh of hosts, The mountain of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Yet shall old men and old women sit in the broadways of Jerusalem,Yea, each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And, the broadways of the city, shall be full of boys and girls,playing in the broadways thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Because it will be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people, in those days, In mine own eyes also, shall it be marvellous? Demandeth Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Behold me! saving my people out of the land of the dawn,and out of the land of the going in of the sun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them in, and they shall have their habitation in the midst of Jerusalem,and shall become my people, and, I, will become their God, In faithfulness and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Let your hands be strong, ye who are hearing, in these days, these words,from the mouth of the prophets who, on the day the house of Yahweh of hosts, was founded,   that, the temple, should be built:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>That, before those days, hire for man, could not be obtained, and, hire for beast, was there none,and, neither to him who went out nor to him who came in, was there success by reason of the danger, Yea I let all men loose, each one against his neighbour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But, now, not as in the former days, am I to this remnant of the people,Declareth Yahweh of hosts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For, the seed, shall be securethe vine, shall yield her fruit, and the land, yield her increase, and the heavens, yield their dew,and I will cause this remnant of the people to inherit all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass thatJust as ye had become a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, So, will I save you, and ye shall become a blessing,Do not fear, let your hands, be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For, thus, saith Yahweh of hosts, Just as I planned to bring calamity upon you, when your fathers provoked me, saith Yahweh of hosts,and I relented not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>So, have I again planned, in these days, to do good unto Jerusalem, and unto the house of Judah,Do not fear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These, are the things which ye shall do: Speak ye the truth, every man with his neighbour, truth and the sentence of peace, pronounce ye in your gates;</verse>
