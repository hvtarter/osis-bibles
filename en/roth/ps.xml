        <title>Every thing lofty, he beholdeth, he, is king over all ravenous beasts.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'> BOOK THE FIRST  How happy the man, who hath not walked in the counsel of the lawless,and, in the way of sinners, hath not stood, and, in the seat of scoffers, hath not sat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But, in the law of Yahweh, is his delight,and, in his law, doth he talk with himself day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>So doth he become like a tree planted by streams of waters,that yieldeth, its fruit, in its season, whose leaf, also doth not wither, and, whatsoever he doeth, prospereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>Not so, the lawless,but as chaff which is driven about by the wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>For this cause, shall the lawless not stand in the judgment,nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For Yahweh doth acknowledge the way of the righteous; but, the way of the lawless, shall vanish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult? Or should, peoples, mutter an empty thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of earth take their station, and, grave men, have met by appointment together,against Yahweh, and against his Anointed One   :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let us break asunder their bonds,and cast from us their cords!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He that sitteth in the heavens, will laugh,My Lord, will mock at them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then, will he speak unto them in his anger, and, in his wrath, confound them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet, I, have installed my king,on Zion my holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>Let me tell of a decree,Yahweh, hath said unto me, My son, thou art, I, to-day, have begotten thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and let me give nations as thine inheritance, and, as thy possession, the ends of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>Thou shalt shepherd them with a sceptre of iron,as a potters vessel, shalt thou dash them in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Now, therefore, ye kings, show your prudence, Be admonished, ye judges of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve Yahweh with reverence, and exult with trembling:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish by the way, for soon might be kindled his anger,How happy are all who seek refuge in him!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>Yahweh! how have mine adversaries multiplied, Multitudes, are rising against me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Multitudes, are saying of my soul,No salvation for him in God.  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But, thou, Yahweh, art a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>With my voiceunto Yahweh, do I cry, and he hath answered me out of his holy mountain.  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I, laid me down and slept,I awoke, Surely, Yahweh, sustaineth me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I will not be afraid of myriads of people, who, round about, have set themselves against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Rise! Yahweh, Save me, my God. Surely thou hast smitten all my foes on the cheekbone, The teeth of the lawless, hast thou broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>To Yahweh, belongeth Salvation! Upon thy people, be thy blessing.  Selah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>When I cry, answer me, O mine own righteous God, In a strait place, thou hast made room for me, Show me favour, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>Ye sons of the great! how long, turning my glory to contempt, will ye love emptiness, will ye seek falsehood?  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>Know ye, then, that Yahweh hath set apart the man of lovingkindness for himself: Yahweh, will hear, when I cry to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Be deeply moved, but do not sin,Ponder in your own heart upon your bed, and be silent.  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness; and put your trust in Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>Multitudes, are saying, Who will show us prosperity? Lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance, O Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>Thou hast put gladness in my heart,beyond the season when, their corn and their new wine, have increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>In peace, will I lay me down and at once sleep; for, thou, Yahweh alone, wilt cause me, in security, to dwell.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.1'>To my words, give ear, O Yahweh, Understand thou my softly murmured prayer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.2'>Attend to the voice of my cry, my King and my God, for, unto thee, do I pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>O Yahweh! in the morning, shalt thou hear my voice, In the morning, will I set in order unto thee, and keep watch;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For, not a GOD finding pleasure in lawlessness, art thou, and wrong can be no guest of thine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>Boasters, shall not station themselves, before thine eyes,Thou hatest all workers of iniquity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>Thou wilt destroy them who speak falsehood,The man of bloodshed and of deceit, Yahweh abhorreth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But, I, in the abounding of thy lovingkindness, will enter thy house, I will bow down towards thy holy temple, in reverence of thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>O Yahweh! lead me in thy righteousness, because of mine adversaries, Make even, before me, thy way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For in his mouth is nothing worthy of trust, Their inward purpose, is engulphing ruin,An opened sepulchre, is their throat, With their tongue, speak they smooth things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall by their own counsels,Into the throng of their own transgressions, thrust them down, For they have rebelled against thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>That all may rejoice who seek refuge in thee, to times age-abiding, may shout in triumph, that thou wilt protect them, and they may leap for joy in thee who are lovers of thy Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For, thou, wilt bless the righteous man, O Yahweh, As with an all-covering shieldwith good pleasure, wilt thou encompass him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>O Yahweh! do not, in thine anger, correct me, nor, in thy wrath, chastise me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Show me favour, O Yahweh, for languishing am I: Heal me, O Yahweh,for dismayed are my bones:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>Yea, my soul, is dismayed greatly, Thou, then, O Yahwehhow long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O Yahweh, deliver my soul, Save me, for the sake of thy lovingkindness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For, in death, is no remembrance of thee,In hades, who shall give thanks unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary with my sighing, I flood, through the whole night, my couch,With my tears, I cause, my bed, to dissolve:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>My face, is all sunken with sorrow,it hath aged, because of all mine adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for Yahweh hath heard the voice of my weeping:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>Yahweh, hath heard my supplication, Yahweh, will receive, my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.10'>Let all my foes, turn pale and be greatly dismayed, Again let them turn pale in a moment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.7.1'>O Yahweh my God, in thee, have I sought refuge,Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.2'>Lest one tear, as a lion, my soul,and there be no deliverer to rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O Yahweh my God, If I have done this, If there hath been perversity in my hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>If I have requited my friend with wrong,or have oppressed mine adversary without need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>Let an enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, that he may tread down, to the earth, my life,and, mine honourin the dust, he may cause to dwell.  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Rise! Yahweh! in thine anger, Lift thyself up, because of the haughty outbursts of mine adversaries, Stir up for me the justice thou hast commanded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>When, the assembly of peoples, gather round thee, then, above iton high, do thou return!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.8'>Yahweh, will judge the peoples,Do me justice, O Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity upon me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.9'>Let the wrong of the lawless, I pray thee, come to an end, and establish thou him that is righteous,for, a trier of hearts and reins, is God the righteous one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.10'>My shield, is held by God, who is ready to save the upright in heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.11'>A God to vindicate the righteous,and yet a Got to be indignant throughout every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.12'>If he turn not, his sword, will he whet,his bow, hath he bent, and made ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.13'>But, for himself, hath he made ready the weapons so deadly, His arrows, he, so fiery, would make:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.14'>Lo! he gendereth trouble, and conceiveth mischief, but giveth birth to a disappointment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>A pit, he cut out, and digged it, and then fell into the ditch he had made:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His mischief, turneth back, on his own head,and, on his own crown, his violence, descendeth.</verse>
