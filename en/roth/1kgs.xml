      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <title>Uriah, the Hittite, In all, thirty and seven.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now, King David, was old, advanced in days,and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Wherefore his servants said unto himLet there be sought for my lord the king, a young womana virgin, so shall she stand before the king, that she may become his companion,and she shall lie in thy bosom, and my lord the king shall get, heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought a fair young woman, throughout all the bounds of Israel,and found Abishag, the Shunammite, and brought her in, unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>Now, the young woman, was exceeding fair,so she became unto the king a companion, and ministered unto him, but, the king, knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>And, Adonijah son of Haggith, exalted himself, sayingI, will be king. Therefore prepared he for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>Now his father had not displeased him all his days, by sayingWhy, thus, hast thou done? Moreover also, he, was of exceeding handsome appearance, and, him, did his mother bear, after Absolom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>So then he had speech with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest,and they gave help, following Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But, Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and heifers, near the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel,and invited all his brethren, sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, servants of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then spake Nathan unto Bath-sheba mother of Solomon, sayingHast thou not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith hath become king, and, our lord David, knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now, therefore, come; let me give thee counsel, I pray thee,so shalt thou rescue thine own life, and the life of thy son, Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go, and get thee in unto King David, and thou shalt say unto himDidst not, thou thyself, my lord O king, swear unto thy handmaid, sayingSolomon thy son, shall become king after me, yea, he, shall sit upon my throne? Why, then, hath, Adonijah, become king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Lo! while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I also, will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bath-sheba went in unto the king, into the chamber, now, the king, was very old,and Abishag the Shunammite, was ministering unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bath-sheba bowed, and did homage unto the king,and the king saidWhat aileth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said unto himMy lord, thou thyself, didst swear by Yahweh thy God, unto thy handmaid, Assuredly, Solomon thy son, shall become king after me,yea, he, shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>But, now, lo! Adonijah, hath become king; now, therefore, my lord, O king, thou knowest it not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>and he hath sacrificed oxen and heifers and sheep, in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab general of the army,but, Solomon thy servant, hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>Thou, therefore, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel, are upon thee,to tell them, who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king, after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, then shall I and my son Solomon be counted, offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And lo! while yet she was speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>So they told the king, saying, Lo! Nathan the prophet! And, when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself down to the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>Then said NathanMy lord, O king, hast, thou, said, Adonijah, shall become king after me,yea, he, shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he hath gone down to-day, and hath sacrificed oxen and heifers and sheep, in abundance, and hath invited all the sons of the king, and the generals of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and, there they areeating and drinking before him,and they have saidLong live King Adonijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But, me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and Solomon thy servant, hath he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>If, of my lord the king, this thing had been brought to pass, then wouldest thou not have made known unto thy servant, who should sit upon the throne of my lord the king, after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then responded King David, and said, Call me Bath-sheba. So she came in before the king, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king sware, and said,By the life of Yahweh, who hath redeemed my life out of every strait,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>even as I sware unto thee by Yahweh, God of Israel, saying, Assuredly, Solomon thy son, shall become king after me, yea, he, shall sit upon my throne, in my stead, even so, will I do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the ground, and did homage unto the king,and saidLet my lord, King David, live to times age-abiding!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>Then said King DavidCall me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada. And they came in before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>Then said the king unto themTake ye with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon the mule which pertaineth unto myself,and bring him down unto Gihon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>then shall Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel,and ye shall blow with the horn, and sayLong live King Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then shall ye come up after him, and he shall enter, and sit upon my throne, yea, he, shall become king in my stead; even, him, have I charged to become leader, over Israel, and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>Then did Benaiah son of Jehoiada make response unto the king, and sayAmen! so, say Yahweh, God of my lord the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As Yahweh hath been with my lord the king, so, let him he with Solomon,and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord, King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon the mule of King David,and they escorted him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>Then took Zadok the priest, the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon,and they blew with a   horn, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, the people themselves also, playing with flutes, and rejoicing with great joy,so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah, and all the guests who were with him, heard it, just as, they, had made an end of eating,and, when Joab heard the sound of a horn, he saidWherefore the noise of the city, in tumult?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While yet he was speaking, lo! Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest, came in,and Adonijah saidCome in, for, a worthy man, thou art, and, good tidings, dost thou bring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>But Jonathan responded and said to Adonijah,Of a truth, our lord, King David, hath made, Solomon, king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king hath sent with himZadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,and they have caused him to ride upon the mule of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king, in Gihon, and they went up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again,That, is the noise ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>Moreover also, Solomon hath taken his seat upon the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>Moreover also, the servants of the king have been in, to bless our lord King David, sayingThy God make the name better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne,And the king bowed himself upon his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>Moreover also, thus and thus, hath said the king,Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who hath given, to-day, one to sit upon my throne, mine own eyes also beholding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>Then trembled and rose up, all Adonijahs guests,and departed, every man his own way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>Adonijah also, feared because of Solomon,and rose and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Lo! Adonijah, feareth King Solomon,lo! therefore, he hath laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me at once that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>Then said Solomon, If he will be a man of worth, there shall not one hair of him fall to the earth,but, if mischief be found in him, then shall he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So King Solomon sent, and brought him down from the altar, and he came in, and bowed himself down to King Solomon,and Solomon said unto himGo to thine own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And, when the days of David drew near that he must die, he charged Solomon his son, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I, am going the way of all the earth,thou must be strong, therefore, and show thyself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the observances of Yahweh thy God, by walking in his ways, by keeping his statutes, his commandments, and his regulations and his testimonies, as written in the law of Moses,to the end thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>to the end that Yahweh may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy sons will take heed to their way, by walking before me, in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, (then, said he) there shall not be cut off to thee a man, from off the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover also, thou, knowest what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with two generals of the armies of Israelwith Abner son of Ner, and with Amasa son of Jetherboth of whom he slew, shedding the blood of war in peace,and putting the blood of war upon his girdle that was on his loins, and upon his sandals, that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Thou, therefore, must do according to thy wisdom,but will not let his grey hair go down in peace, to hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But, with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, thou wilt deal in lovingkindness, and they will be among them who eat at thy table,for, so, drew they near unto me, when I fled from Absolom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>Lo! also, there is with theeShimei son of Gera a Benjamite, of Behurim, well, he, it was who cursed me with a grievous curse; on the day I journeyed to Mahanaim,but he, came down to meet me, at the Jordan, and so I sware to him by Yahweh, sayingI will not put thee to death, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now, therefore do not hold him guiltless, for, a wise man, thou art, and wilt know how thou oughtest to deal with him, and wilt suffer his grey hairs to go down with blood, to hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So then David slept with his fathers,and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>Now, the days that David reigned over Israel, were forty years,in Hebron, reigned he seven years, and, in Jerusalem, reigned he thirty and three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>But, when, Solomon, took his seat upon the throne of David his father, then was the kingdom firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah son of Haggith came in unto Bath-sheba, mother of Solomon: And she saidPeaceably, comest thou? And he saidPeaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>Then said heI have somewhat to say unto thee. And she saidSay on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he saidThou, knowest that, mine, was the kingdom, and, on me, had all Israel set their faces, that I should become king,howbeit the kingdom, hath turned about, and become my brothers, for, from Yahweh, became it, his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>Now, therefore, one request, have I to ask of thee, do not turn away my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And she said unto himSay on. And he saidSpeak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, for he will not turn away thy face,that he give me Abishag the Shunammite, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bath-sheba said: Good! I myself, will speak for thee, unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>So Bath-sheba went in unto King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah,and the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself down to her, and sat down upon his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then said sheOne small request, am I asking of thee, do not turn away my face. And the king said to herAsk on, my mother, for I will not turn away thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>Then answered King Solomon, and said to his motherWherefore, then, art thou asking Abishag the Shunammite, for Adonijah? ask, then, for him the kingdom, because he is mine elder brother,even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab, son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then swore King Solomon by Yahweh, saying,So, let God do to me, and, so, let him add, if, at the cost of his life, Adonijah hath not spoken this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now, therefore, by the life of Yahweh, who hath established me, and seated me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made for me a household, as he had spoken, surely, to-day, shall Adonijah be put to death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah son of Jehoiada,and he fell upon him, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>Also, unto Abiathar the priest, said the kingTo Anathoth, get thee unto thine own fields, for, death-doomed, thou art,but, this day, will I not put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of My Lord, Yahweh, before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Yahweh,to fulfil the word of Yahweh which he spake concerning the household of Eli, in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And, the report, came unto Joab, for, Joab, had inclined after Adonijah, although, after Solomon, he had not inclined,so then Joab fled into the Tent of Yahweh, and laid hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told King SolomonJoab hath fled into the Tent of Yahweh, and, there he is, beside the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, sayingGo fall upon him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came into the Tent of Yahweh, and said unto himThus, saith the king, Come forth! And he saidNay! but, here, will I die! So Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus, spake Joab, and, thus, he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to himDo as he hath spoken, fall, then, upon him, and bury him,and so put away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from off me, and from off the house of my father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>thus will Yahweh bring back his blood upon his own head, in that he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it,even Abner son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa son of Jether, general of the army of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>thus shall their blood come back upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed unto times age-abiding,but, David and his seed, and his house, and his throne, shall have peace, unto times age-abiding, from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and put him to death,and he was buried in his own house, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in his stead, over the army,and, Zadok the priest, did the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent, and called for Shimei, and said to himBuild thee a house, in Jerusalem, so shalt thou dwell there,and shalt not go forth from thence, hither or thither;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>but it shall be that, on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the Kidron ravine, know, that thou shalt, die,thy blood, shall be, upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the kingGood, is the word, as my lord the king hath spoken, so, will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>But it came to pass, at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei fled unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath,and they told Shimei, sayingLo! thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>So Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, unto Achish, to seek his servantsand Shimei went and brought in his servants, from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told SolomonShimei hath been out of Jerusalem to Gath, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>Then sent the king and called for Shimei, and said unto himDid I not put thee on oath by Yahweh, and adjure thee, sayingOn the day thou goest forth and takest thy journey hither or thither, know, that thou shalt, die. Then saidst thou unto meGood, is the word I have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then, hast thou not kept the oath of Yahweh,and the charge which I laid upon thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>Then said the king unto ShimeiThou, knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, which thou didst unto David my father,therefore shall Yahweh bring back thy wickedness, upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But, King Solomon, shall be blessed,and, the throne of David, shall be established before Yahweh, unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king charged Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and fell upon him, that he died,and, the kingdom, was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon contracted an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt,and took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem, round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Save only, that the people were sacrificing in the high places,because there had not been built a house unto the Name of Yahweh, until those days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>Solomon loved Yahweh, by walking in the statutes of David his father,save only, that, in the high places, he himself, was sacrificing and offering incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>So then the king went to Gibeon, to sacrifice there, for, that, was the great high place,a thousand ascending-sacrifices, did Solomon offer up on that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon, Yahweh appeared unto Solomon, in a dream by night,and God said, Ask, what I shall give thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.21'>And the king of Israel went forth, and took the horses and the chariots,and he went on smiting the Syrians, with a great smiting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.22'>Then drew near the prophet, unto the king of Israel, and said unto himGo strengthen thyself, and mark and see, what thou wilt do,for, at the return of the year, is, the king of Syria, coming up against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.23'>And, the servants of the king of Syria, said unto him,Gods of the mountains, are their gods, for this cause, prevailed they against us,but, only let us fight with them in the plain, and verily we shall prevail against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.24'>But, this thing, do,set aside the kings, every man out of his place, and put governors in their stead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.25'>and, thou, must number thee a force, like the force which thou hast lost, both horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and, if we fight with them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.26'>And so it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians,and came up to Aphek, to fight with Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.27'>and, the sons of Israel, were numbered, and provisioned, and went to meet them,and the sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, whereas, the Syrians, filled the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.28'>Then approached the man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and saidThus, saith YahwehBecause the Syrians have saidA god of the mountains, is Yahweh, but, not a god of the vales, is he, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude, into thy hand, so shalt thou know, that, I, am Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.29'>So they encamped, these, over against, those, seven days,and it came to pass, on the seventh day, that the battle was joined, and the sons of Israel smote the Syrians, a hundred thousand footmen, in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.30'>And they who were left fled to Aphek, into the city, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men who were left,and, Ben-hadad, fled, and came into the city, into a chamber within a chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.31'>And his servants said unto him, Lo! we pray thee, we have heard, of the kings of the house of Israel, that, kings known for lovingkindness, they are.

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.32'>So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and   ropes about their heads, and came in unto the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant, Ben-hadad, saith,Let my soul live, I pray thee. And he said,Is he yet alive? My brother, he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.33'>Now, the men, could divine, so they hastened to let him confirm the word of his own accord, and they said,Thy brother, is Ben-hadad! He said therefore,Go fetch him. So Ben-hadad came forth unto him, and he made him come up unto him on his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.34'>And he said unto himThe cities which my father took from thy father, will I restore, and, bazaars, shalt thou make thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. So then, I, with this covenant, will let thee go. So he solemnised with him a covenant, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.35'>And, a certain man of the sons of the prophets, said unto his neighbour, by the word of YahwehSmite me, I pray thee. But the man refused to smite him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.37'>Then found he another man, and said,Smite me, I pray thee. So the man smote himkept on smiting and wounding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.38'>Then the prophet departed, and waited for the king, by the way,and disguised himself with his turban over his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.39'>And so it was, when, the king, was passing, he, cried out unto the king,and saidThy servant, went out in the midst of the battle, and lo! a man, turned aside and brought unto me a man, and saidKeep this man, if he be, missing, then shall, thy life, go for, his life, or, a talent of silver, shalt thou weigh out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.40'>And so it was, as thy servant was busy here and there, that, he, was gone. And the king of Israel said unto himSuch, is thy judgment, thou thyself, hast decided it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.41'>Then hastened he, and removed the turban from over his eyes,and the king of Israel knew him, that, of the prophets, was, he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.42'>And he said unto himThus, saith Yahweh, Because thou hast let go the man whom I had devoted, out of thy hand, therefore shall, thy life, be instead of, his life, and, thy people, instead of, his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.43'>And the king of Israel departed unto his house, sullen and disturbed,and entered Samaria.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.1'>And it came to pass, after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had, a vineyard, which was in Jezreel,hard by the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.2'>Ahab, therefore, spake unto Naboth, sayingCome! give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, for, the same, is near by my house, and let me give thee, instead thereof, a vineyard better than it,if it be good in thine eyes, I will give thee silver to the value of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.3'>And Naboth said unto Ahab,Far be it from me, of Yahweh! that I should give up the inheritance of my fathers, unto thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.4'>So Ahab came into his house, sullen and disturbed, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken unto him, that he should have said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. So he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and did eat no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.5'>Then came unto him Jezebel his wife,and said unto himWhy is it, that thy spirit is sullen, that thou art, not eating food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.6'>And he said unto herBecause I spake unto Naboth, the Jezreelite, and said unto himCome! give me thy vineyard for silver, or, if thou wouldst prefer, I will give thee a vineyard, in its stead; and he saidI will not give thee my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.7'>Then Jezebel his wife said unto him: Art, thou, still, going to carry on the kingdom over Israel? Rise! eat food, and let thy heart be merry, I, will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.8'>So she wrote letters, in the name of Ahab, and sealed them with his signet-ring,and sent the letters unto the elders, and unto the nobles who were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.9'>Now she wrote in the letters, saying,Proclaim ye a fast, and cause Naboth to sit at the head of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.10'>then let two reckless men take their seats before him, that they may bear witness against him, saying, Thou hast reviled God and king! then shall ye carry him forth and stone him, that he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did just as Jezebel had sent unto them,as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>they proclaimed a fast,and caused Naboth to sit at the head of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>Then came in the two reckless men, and sat before him, and the men bare witness against him, even against Naboth, before the people, saying, Naboth hath reviled God and king! So they carried him forth, outside the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then sent they unto Jezebel, saying,Naboth is stoned and is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said unto AhabRise! take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for silver, for Naboth is not alive, but dead!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose, to go down unto the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise! go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria,lo! he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he hath gone down, to take possession thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>Then shalt thou speak unto him, sayingThus, saith Yahweh, Hast thou committed murder, and also taken possession? Then shalt thou speak unto him, saying: Thus, saith Yahweh, In the place where the dogs have lapped up the blood of Naboth, shall the dogs lap up thy blood, even thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>Then said Ahab unto Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he said: I have found   ! Because thou hast sold thyself to do the thing that is wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold me!   bringing in upon thee, calamity, and I will consume after thee,and cut off of Ahab, even the meanest, whether shut up or left at large in Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>and will deliver up thy houseLike the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah,for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked, and caused, Israel, to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>Moreover also, concerning Jezebel, hath Yahweh spoken, saying,The dogs, shall eat Jezebel, in the town-land of Jezreel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>Him that dieth, of Ahab, in the city, shall, the dogs, eat,and, him that dieth in the field, shall, the birds of heaven, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>But indeed, there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh,whom Jezebel his wife goaded on;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>so that he did very abominably, in going after the manufactured gods,according to all which the Amorites had done, whom Yahweh dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard these words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted,and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Hast thou seen that Allah hath humbled himself, before me? Because he hath humbled himself before me, I will not bring in the calamity in his days, In the days of his son, will I bring in the calamity upon his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And there continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>But it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down unto the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that, ours, is Ramoth-gilead,yet, we, are too idle to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to make war upon Ramoth-gilead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people are us thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then said Jehoshaphat unto the king of Israel,Seek, I pray thee, at once, the word of Yahweh. So the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, about four hundred men, and said unto themShall I go against Ramoth-gilead, to battle, or shall I forbear? And they saidGo up, that the Lord may deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>Then said Jehoshaphat, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, besides,that we may seek, from him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Besides, is a certain man, by whom we might seek Yahweh, but, I, hate him, for he is never moved to prophesy concerning me anything good, only evil, Micaiah, son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called a certain courtier,and said, Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>Now, the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, were sittingeach man upon his throne, having put on robes, in a level place, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria,and, all the prophets, were being moved to prophesy before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>when Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron,and saidThus, saith Yahweh,With these, shalt thou push down the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>Now, the messenger who went to call Micaiah, spake unto him, saying, Behold, I pray thee, the words of the prophets, with one mouth, are good, as touching the king, let thy word, I pray thee, be as the word of one of them, so wilt thou speak that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said,By the life of Yahweh, what Yahweh saith unto me, that, will I, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>So he came unto the king, and the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he said unto himGo up and prosper, and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said unto him, How many times must, I, adjure thee,that thou speak unto me nothing but truth, in the name of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he saidI saw all Israel, scattered among the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd,so Yahweh said, These have, no masters, let them return every man unto his own house, in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>Then said the king of Israel, unto Jehoshaphat,Did I not say unto thee, He will not be moved to prophesy concerning me anything good, only calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>Then he said, Therefore, hear thou the word of Yahweh,I saw Yahweh, sitting upon his throne, and all the host of the heavens, standing by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And Yahweh said, Who will persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall, at Ramoth-gilead? And, one, said in this manner, and, another, said in that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>Then came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and saidI, will persuade him.</verse>
