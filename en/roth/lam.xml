        <title>Then shalt thou say,In like manner, shall Babylon sink and not rise Because of the calamity which I am about to bring thereupon: So shall they perish. Thus far, are, the words of Jeremiah.</title>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How is seated alone, the city that abounded with people, hath become as a widow,She who abounded among the nations was a princess among provinces, hath come under tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She, weepeth sore, in the night, and, her tear, is on her cheek, She hath none to comfort her, of all her lovers,All her friends, have betrayed her, have become her foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Carried away captive is Judahbecause of oppression, and because of great servitude, She, hath remained among the nations, hath found no place of rest,All her pursuers, have overtaken her, between straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways to Zion, are mourning, because none come to her appointed feasts, All her gates, are desolate, her priests, are sighing,her virgins, are grieved, and, she, it is bitter for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries have become chief, her foes, are at ease, for, Yahweh, hath grieved her, because of the multitude of her transgressions,Her children, have gone into captivity, before the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>Thus hath gone forth from the daughter of Zion, all that adorned her,Her princes have become like harts that have found no pasture, and have gone strengthless before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem hath remembered in the days of her humiliation and her fleeingsall her precious things, which have existed from the days of old,Now that her people have been falling into the hand of the adversary, with none to help her, the adversaries have seen her, have mocked over her sabbath-keepings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Jerusalem, hath grievously sinned, For this cause, unto exile, hath she been delivered,All who used to honour her, have despised her, for they have descried her unseemliness, yea, she herself, hath sighed, and turned back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her impurity, is in her skirts, She hath not remembered her hereafter, Therefore hath she come down wonderfully, none to comfort her,Behold, O Yahweh, my humiliation, that the foe, hath made himself great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>His hand, hath the adversary spread out, over all her precious things,for she saw that, the nations, entered her sanctuary, as to whom thou didst command they should not enterin the convocationunto thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people, are sighing, seeking bread, They have given their precious things for food, to bring back life,Behold, O Yahweh, and discern, that I have become worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Look around and see, whether there is pain like my pain, which is severely dealt out to me,in that Yahweh, hath caused grief, in the day of the glow of his anger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From on high, sent he fire, among my bones, and laid them prostrate,He spread out a net for my feet, he made me turn back, he made me desolate, all the day, faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The yoke of my transgressions, hath been bound, by his handThey have intertwined themselves, have come up on my neck, it hath paralysed my strength,My Lord, hath delivered me, into the hands of those against whom I cannot rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>My Lord, hath flouted at all my magnates, in my midst, He hath called against me a host, to crush my young men,A winepress, hath My Lord trodden, to the virgin, the daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things, am, I, weeping, Mine eye, mine eye, is running down with waters, for, far from me, is any who could comfort, could bring back my life,My sons are amazed, for strong is the foe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion, hath spread forth, her hands, there is none to comfort her, Yahweh, hath given command, respecting Jacob, unto them who surround himhis adversaries,Jerusalem, hath become as a removed woman, in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>Righteous is Yahweh, for, against his bidding, had I rebelled,Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and see my pain, My virgins and my young men, have gone into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called to my lovers, they, deceived me, My priests and mine elders, in the city, have breathed their last,for they sought them food, that they might bring back their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>See, O Yahweh, that I am in distress, Mine inward parts, are in ferment, My heart is turned within me, for I have obstinately rebelled,Without, bereaveth the sword, Within, is like death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They have heardthat, sighing am, I,   There is none to comfort me, All my foes,having heard of my calamityhave rejoiced, because, thou, hast done it,thou hast brought in the day thou didst proclaim, So let them become like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Let all their wickedness, come in, before thee, and deal thou severely with them, according as thou hast dealt severely with me, for all my transgressions; for many are my sighs, and, my heart, is sick.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How could My Lord, in his anger, enshroud in gloom, the daughter of Zion? have cast from the heavens to the earth, the beauty of Israel? and not have remembered his footstool, in the day of his anger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>My Lord hath swallowed upwithout pityall the pastures of Jacob, hath laid wastein his indignationthe strongholds of the daughter of Judah, hath brought them down to the ground,hath profaned the kingdom, and the princes thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He hath broken offin the glow of his angerthe whole horn of Israel, hath turned back his right hand, from the face of the foe,and hath kindled against Jacob, a very fire of flame, devouring round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He hath trodden his bow like a foe, his right hand erect as an adversary, and hath slain all them who delighted the eye,In the home of the daughter of Zion, hath he poured out, as fire, his indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>My Lord hath become like a foe, hath swallowed up Israel, hath swallowed up all her castles, ruined his strongholds,and hath caused to abound, in the daughter of Judah, lamentation and mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>Thus hath he destroyed, like a garden, his pavilion, hath laid waste his place of assembly,Yahweh, hath caused to be forgotten, in Zion, the appointed assembly and the sabbath, and hath spurned, in the indignation of his anger, the king and the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>My Lord hath rejected his altar, hath abhorred his sanctuary, hath delivered, into the hand of the foe, the walls of her castles,A voice, have they uttered in the house of Yahweh, as on the day of an appointed assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>Yahweh hath devised to lay in ruins, the wall of the daughter of Zion, he hath stretched out a line, he hath not turned back his hand from swallowing up,Thus hath he caused to mournrampart and wall, together, have they languished!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates, have sunk in the earth, He hath destroyed and broken in pieces, her bars,Her king and her princes, are among the nations, There is no instruction, Even her prophets, have found no vision, from Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>Seated on the ground, in silence, are the elders of the daughter of Zion, They have lifted up dust on their head, have girded themselves with sackcloth,Bowed down to the ground is the head, of the virgins of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>Blinded with tears are mine eyes, In ferment is my body, Poured out to the earth is my grief, for the sore hurt of the daughter of my people,when child and suckling are swooning, in the broadways of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>To their mothers, they keep saying, Where are corn and wine? Swooning off, like one thrust through, in the broadways of the city, pouring out their life into the bosom of their mothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>How shall I solemnly admonish thee? What shall I liken to thee, thou daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare with thee, that I may comfort thee, thou virgin, daughter of Zion? for, great as the sea, is thy grievous injury, Who can heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Thy prophets, have had visions for thee, false and foolish, and have not unveiled thine iniquity, to turn back thy captivity,Yea they have had visions for thee, oracles of falsehood, and enticements!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All passing by, have clapped, over thee, their hands, have hissed and wagged their head over the daughter of Jerusalem,  , Is, this, the city, of which men used to sayThe perfection of beauty! A joy to the whole earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All thy foes, have opened wide, over thee their mouth, They have hissed, and gnashed their teeth, They have saidWe have swallowed   up! Surely, this, is the day for which we have waited, We have found! We have seen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>Yahweh hath done what he thought, hath carried out his word, wherewith he gave charge in the days of old, hath thrown down, and not spared,Thus hath he let the enemy rejoice over thee, hath raised high the horn of thine adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart, hath made outcry, unto My Lord,O wall of the daughter of ZionLet tears run down as a torrent day and night, Do not give thyself relief, Let not the weeping of thine eye cease!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry out in the night, At the beginning of the watches, pour out, like waters, thy heart, right before the face of My Lord,Lift up, above thee, the palms of thy hands, for the life of thy children, who are swooning for hunger, at the top of all the streets!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>See, O Yahweh, and do consider, to whom thou hast acted thus severely,Will women, devour, their own fruitthe children they have dandled? Shall priest and prophet, be slain in the sanctuary of My Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>Youth and elder, have lain down on the ground in the streets, My virgins and my young men, have fallen by the sword,Thou hast slain, in the day of thine anger, Thou hast slaughtered, hast not spared!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Wilt thou proclaim, like the day of an appointed meetingMy terrors round about? when there was notin the day of the anger of Yahwehfugitive or survivor,Those whom I dandled and reared, my foe hath destroyed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.5'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.1'>Remember, O Yahweh, what hath befallen us, Look around, and see our reproach:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.2'>Our inheritance, turned over to foreigners, our houses, to aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.3'>Orphans, have we become, and fatherless, our mothers, are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.4'>Our waterfor silver, have we drunk, our woodfor a price, cometh in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.5'>Upon our necks, are our pursuers, We labour, and there is allowed us no rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.6'>To Egypt, have we stretched out our hand, to Assyria, to be satisfied with bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.7'>Our fathers, sinned, and are not, and, we, their iniquities, have borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.8'>Slaves, have ruled over us, There is none to set free from their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.9'>At the risk of our life, do we bring in our bread, because of the sword of the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.10'>Our skin, as with a furnace, is scorched, because of the hot winds of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.11'>Womenin Zion, were ravished, virgins, in the cities of Judah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.12'>Princes, by their hand, have been hanged, The faces of elders, not honoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.13'>Young men, a millstone, have lifted, and, youths, under wood, have staggered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.14'>Elders, from the gates, have ceased. Young men, from their music.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.15'>Ceased hath the joy of our hearts, Changed to mourning, our dance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.16'>Fallen is the crown of our head. Surely woe to us, for we have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.17'>For this cause, faint is our heart, For these things, dimmed are our eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.18'>Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate, jackals, have gone prowling therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.19'>Thou, O Yahweh, unto times age-abiding, dost remain, Thy throne, from generation to generation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.20'>Wherefore shouldst thou perpetually forget us? forsake us, to length of days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.21'>Bring us back, O Yahweh, unto thyself, and we will come back! Renew our days, as of old;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.22'>For though thou hast not, utterly rejected, us, thou art wroth with usexceedingly!</verse>
