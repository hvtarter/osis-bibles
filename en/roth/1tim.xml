        <title>Console your hearts, and confirm you in every good work and word!</title>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesusby injunction of God our Saviour and Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>unto Timothy, my true child in faith: favour, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>Even as I exhorted thee to remain in Ephesus, when I was journeying into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>Not to be teaching otherwise, nor yet to be giving heed to stories and endless genealogies,the which, bring, arguings, rather than that stewardship of God which is with faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Now, the end of the charge, is loveout of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>Which some, missing, have turned them aside unto idle talk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>Desiring to be law-teachers,not understanding, either what they say or whereof they confidently affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>Now we know that, excellent, is the law, if one put it to a lawful use:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>Knowing thisthat, to a righteous man, law, doth not apply, but to the lawless and insubordinate, ungodly and sinful, irreligious and profane, smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers, murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>fornicators, sodomites, man-stealers, liars, false- swearers,and, if anything else, unto the healthful teaching, is opposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>According to the glad-message of the glory of the happy God, with which entrusted am, I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>Grateful, am I unto him that empowered me, Christ Jesus our Lord, in that, faithful, he accounted me, putting me into ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>Though, formerly, a defamer, and persecutor, and insulter; nevertheless mercy was shown me, because, without knowledge, I acted, in unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>Yet exceeding abundant was the favour of our Lord, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful, the saying! and, of all acceptance, worthy,that, Christ Jesus, came into the world, sinners, to save: of whom, the chief, am, I;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>Nevertheless, on this account, was mercy shewn me,that, in me, the chief, Christ Jesus might shew forth his entire longsuffering, for an ensample of them about to believe on him unto life age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now, unto the King of the ages,incorruptible, invisible, alone God, be honour and glory, unto the ages of ages, Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge, I commit unto thee, child Timothy, According to the prophecies, running before on thee, in order that thou mightest war, with them, the noble warfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Holding faith and a good conscience,which some, thrusting from them, concerning their faith, have made shipwreck:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may be taught by discipline not to be defaming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort, therefore, first of all, that there be madesupplications, prayers, intercessions, thankgivings, in behalf of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>In behalf of kings, and all them who are, in eminent station; in order that, an undisturbed, and quiet life, we may lead, in all godliness and gravity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This, is comely and acceptable before our Saviour God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>Who willeth, all men, to be saved, and, unto a personal knowledge of truth, to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is, one, God, one, mediator also, between God and men,a manChrist Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>Who gave himself a ransom in behalf of all,the testimony, in its own fit times:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>Unto which, I, have been appointed proclaimer and apostleTruth I speak, I utter no falsehooda teacher of nations, in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I am minded, therefore, thatthe men in every place be offering prayer, uplifting hands of lovingkindness, apart from anger and disputings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In the same way, that, the women, in seemly attire, with modesty and sober-mindedness, be adorning themselves,not with plaitings and ornamentation of gold, or with pearls, or with costly apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>But, which becometh women promising godliness, through means of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let, a woman, in quietness, be learning in all submission;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But, teachingunto a woman, I do not permit, nor yet to have authority over a man,but to be in quietness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For, Adam, first was formed, then Eve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And, Adam, was not deceived, whereas, the woman, having been wholly deceived, hath come to be, in transgression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>She shall be saved, however, through means of the child-bearing,if they abide in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobermindedness. Faithful, the saying.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>If anyone, for oversight, is eager, a noble work, doth he covet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>It is needful, then, for, the overseer, to be irreproachable, a husband, of one wife, sober, of sound mind, orderly, hospitable, apt in teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>Not given to wine, not ready to wound, but considerate, averse to contention, not fond of money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>Over his own house, presiding, well, having, children, in submission, with all dignity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>Whereas, if anyone, over his own house, cannot, preside, how, of an assembly of God, shall he take care?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>Not a new convert, lest, being beclouded, into the sentence of the adversary, he fall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>It is needful, moreover, to have, an honourable testimony also, from them who are without, lest, into reproach, he fall, and the snare of the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Ministers, in the same way,dignified, not double-tongued, not, to much wine, given, not greedy of base gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>Holding the sacred secret of the faith in a pure conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>But let, these also, be proved first, then, let them be ministering, being, unaccusable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Wives, in the same way,dignified, not given to intrigue, sober, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let, ministers, be husbands of, one wife, over children, presiding, well, and over their own houses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For, they who have ministered well, a good degree for themselves, are acquiring, and great freedom of speech in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things, unto thee, I am writing, hoping to come  unto thee  shortly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But, if I should tarry, that thou mayest knowhow it behoveth, in a house of God, to behave oneself,the which, is an assembly a of a Living God, a pillar and basement of the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And, confessedly great, is the sacred secret of godliness,Who was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, was made visible unto messengers, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>Howbeit, the Spirit, expressly saiththat, in later seasons, some will revolt from the faith, giving heed unto seducing spirits, and unto teachings of demons</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>in hypocrisy, speaking falsehood,   cauterised in their own conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>Forbidding to marry,   to abstain from foods which, God, created to be received with thanksgiving by them who believe and personally know the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>Because, every creature of God, is good, and nothing to be cast away, if, with thanksgiving, it be received,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>For it is hallowed by the word of God and intercession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>These things, submitting to the brethren, thou shall be, a noble, minister of Christ Jesus, nourishing thyself with the words of the faith, and of the noble teaching which thou hast closely studied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But, from the profane and old-wives stories, excuse thyself, and be training thyself unto godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For, the bodily training, for little, is profitable, whereas, godliness, for all things is profitable,having, promise, of lifethe present and the coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Faithful, the saying! and, of all acceptance, worthy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For, to this end, are we toiling and contending, because we have set our hope on a Living God, Who is Saviour of all menspecially, of such as believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Be giving these things in charge, and be teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let, no one, despise, thy youth, but, an ensample, become thou of the faithful,in discourse, in behaviour, in love, in faith, in chastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>While I am coming, be giving heedto the reading, to the exhorting, to the teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Be not careless of the gift of favour, that is in thee, which was given thee through means of prophesying, along with a laying on of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>These things, be thy care, in these things, be thou, that, thine advancement, may be, manifest, unto all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Be giving heed to thyself, and to thy teaching,abide still in them; for, this doing, both, thyself, shalt thou save, and them that hearken to thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>An elderly man, do not thou reprimand, but beseech him, as   father,younger men, as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>Elderly women, as mothers, younger women, as sisters, in all chastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Widows, honour thouwho indeed are widows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>Howbeit, if, any widow, hath, children or grandchildren, let them be learningfirst, unto their own house, to be shewing reverence, and, returns, to be making unto their progenitors; for, this, is acceptable before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>But, she who is indeed a widow, and is left alone, hath turned her hope towards God, and is giving attendance unto the supplications and the prayers, night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>Whereas, she that runneth riot, while living, is, dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And, these things, be giving in charge, that, without reproach, they may be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>If, however, anyone, for his own, and specially them of his household, taketh not forethought, his faith, hath he denied, and is worse, than one without faith!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let, a widow, be put on the listhaving become, not less than sixty years old, one mans, wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>In noble works, being well-attested;if she hath nourished children, if she hath shewn hospitality, if, saints feet, she hath washed, if, them who were in tribulation, she hath succoured, if, in every good, work she hath followed on:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But, younger widows, decline thou; for, as soon as they wax wanton against the Christ, to marry, are they determined,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>Having, as sentence,that, their first faith, they have set at nought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>At the same time, to be idlers, are they learning, going about from house to house; and, not only idlers, but, gossips, also, and, busybodies,saying the things they ought not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I am minded, therefore, that, the younger ones, marry, bear children, be mistress of the house,giving, no single occasion, unto the opposer, as a cause, of reviling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For, already, some have turned aside after Satan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any, believing woman, hath widows, let her be giving them succour, and not suffer the assembly to be burdened,that, them who are indeed widows, it may itself succour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let, the well presiding elders, of double honour, be accounted worthy, especially they who toil in discourse and teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture saithA threshing ox, shalt thou not muzzle, andWorthy, is the workman, of his hire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against an elder, entertain not, an accusation, except at,   two, or three, witnesses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>But, them who are sinning, before all, do thou reprove, that, the rest also, may have, fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I adjure thee, before God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen messengers, that, these things, thou observe, apart from prejudgment, doing, nothing, by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Hands, suddenly, upon no one, lay, neither have fellowship with sins of strangers: thyself, keep, chaste:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer, be a water-drinker, but, of a little wine, make use, because of thy stomach and thy, frequent, sicknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some mens sins, are, openly evident, leading on into judgment, with some, however, they even follow after;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In the same way, the noble works also, are openly evident,and, they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let, as many as are servants under a yoke, be counting, their own masters, worthy, of all honour, lest, the name of God and the teaching, be defamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>They, however, that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are, brethren but, the more, be doing them service, because, believing and beloved, are they who, from the good workmanship, receive advantage. These things, be teaching, and exhorting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone doth otherwise teach, and doth not adhere to healthful discoursesthose of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teaching that is, according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>He is beclouded, knowing, nothing, rightly, but is diseased about questionings, and word-battlesout of which spring envy, strife, defamations, wicked surmising,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>incessant quarrellings of men wholly corrupt in their mind and bereft of the truth,supposing godliness to be, a means of gain!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>Now it is a great means of gaingodliness, with a sufficiency of ones own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For, nothing, brought we into the world, neither, to take anything out, are we able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>And, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But, they who are determined to be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful covetings, the which, sink men into ruin and destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For, a root of all the vices, is the love of money, which, some, being eager for, have been seduced from the faith, and have pierced, themselves, about with many pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But, thou, O man of God! from these things, flee! and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Be contesting the noble contest of the faith,lay hold of the age-abiding lifeunto which thou wast called, and didst make the noble confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge thee, before God, who engendereth life in all things, and Christ Jesus, who, before Pontius Pilate, witnessed the noble confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>That thou keep the commandment without spot, free from reproach, until the forthshining of our Lord Jesus Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>Which, in its own fit times, the happy and only Potentate will shewthe King of them that reign, and Lord of them that wield lordship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>Who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable,Whom no man hath seennor can see: unto whom, be honour and might age-abiding. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Upon them who are rich in the present age, lay thou chargenot to be high-minded, nor to have set their hope on, riches, uncertainty,but on God, who offereth us all things richly for enjoying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>To be doing good, to be rich in noble works, to be, generous in giving, ready for fellowship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>Treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold on the life   indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy! that which hath been entrusted, do thou guard, avoiding the profane pratings and oppositions of falsely named knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Which, some professing, concerning the faith, have missed the mark! Favour be with you.</verse>
