        <title>All they who are with me salute thee. Salute thou them who regard us with faithful affection. Favour, be with you all.</title>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>Whereas, in many parts and in many ways of old, God spake unto the fathers, in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>At the end of these days, He hath spoken unto us in his Son,whom he hath appointed heir of all things, through whom also he hath made the ages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Who, being an eradiated brightness of his glory, and an exact representation of his very being, also bearing up all things by the utterance of his power, purification of sins, having achieved, sat down on the right hand of the majesty in high places:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>By so much becoming superior to the messengers, by as much as, going beyond them, he hath inherited a more distinguished name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For unto which of the messengers said he at any timeMy Son, art, thou, I, this day have begotten thee? and againI, will become, his father, and, he, shall become my Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>But, whensoever he again introduceth the first-begotten into the habitable earth, he saithAnd let all Gods messengers worship him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Even as to the messengers, indeed, he saithWho maketh his messengers, winds, and his ministers of state, a fiery flame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>but, as to the Son,Thy throne, O God, is unto times age-abiding, andA sceptre of equity, is the sceptre of his kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness,For this cause, hath God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of exultation, beyond thy partners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>andThou, by way of beginning, Lord, the earth, didst found, and, the works of thy hands, are the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They, shall perish, but, thou, abidest still, and, all, as a mantle, shall be worn out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>And, as if a robe, wilt thou fold them up,as a mantle, and they shall be changed; but, thou, art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But, to which of the messengers, hath he said, at any timeSit thou at my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not, all, spirits, doing public service,for ministry, sent forth, for the sake of them who are about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>For this cause, it behoveth us, with unwonted firmness, to be holding fast unto the things that have been heard, lest, at any time, we drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For, if the word through messengers spoken became firm, and, every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall, we, escape, if, so great a salvation as this, we have neglected,which, indeed, having received, a beginning, of being spoken through the Lord, by them who heard, unto us was confirmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God, jointly witnessing also, both with signs and wonders and manifold mighty works, and with distributions of Holy Spirit, according to his own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For, not unto messengers, hath he subjected the coming habitable earth of which we are speaking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one somewhere hath borne witness, sayingWhat is man, that thou shouldst make mention of him? Or the son of man, that thou shouldst put him in charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him less, some little, than messengers, With glory and honour, hast thou crowned him, And hast set him over the works of thy hands ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>All things, hast thou subjected beneath his feet. For, in subjecting,  to him  the all things, nothing, left he, to him unsubjected; But now, not yet, do we see, to him, the all things subjected;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But, Jesus, made some little less than messengers, we do behold: by reason of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, to the end that, by favour of God, in behalf of every one, he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was becoming in himFor the sake of whom are the all things, and by means of whom are the all things,when, many sons, unto glory, he would lead, The Princely Leader of their salvation, through sufferings, to make perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For, both he that maketh holy, and they who are being made holy, are, all, of One; For which cause, he is not ashamed to be calling them, brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>sayingI will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of an assembly, will I sing praise unto thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>and againI, will be confident upon him; and againLo! I, and the children which, unto me, God, hath given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Seeing therefore the children have received a fellowship of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took partnership in the same,in order that, through death,he might paralyse him that held the dominion of death, that is, the Adversary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>And might release theseas many as, by fear of death, were all their lifetime liable, to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For, not surely of messengers, is he laying hold, but, of Abrahams seed, he is laying hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Whence he was obliged, in every way, unto the brethren, to be made like, that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest, in the things pertaining unto God,for the making of propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For, in that, he, suffered when tested, he is able, unto them who are being tested, to give succour.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Whence, holy brethren, partners, in a heavenly calling, attentively consider the Apostle and Highpriest of our confessionJesus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>As one, faithful, to him who made him: as, Moses also, in  all  his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For, of more glory than Moses, hath, this one been counted worthyby as much as more honour than, the house, hath, he that prepared it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For, every house, is prepared by someone,but, he that hath prepared all things, is, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Even Moses, indeed, was faithful in all his house, as an attendant, for a witness of the things which were to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>But, Christ, as, a Son, over his house,whose house are, we,if, the freedom of speech and boast of the hope,  throughout, firm,  we hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Wherefore,according as saith the Holy SpiritTo-day, if, unto his voice ye would hearken, do not</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden your hearts,as in the embitterment, in the day of testing in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>When your fathers tested by proving, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Wherefore I was sore vexed with this generation, and said, Always err they in their heart;howbeit, they, learned not my ways:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I sware in mine angerthey shall not enter into my rest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Be taking heed, brethren, lest at any time, there shall be in any one of you, a wicked heart of unbelief, in revolting from a Living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But be exhorting one another, on each successive day,while the To-day is being named! lest any from among you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For, partners of the Christ, have we become,if, at least, the beginning of the confidence, throughout, firm, we hold fast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>So long as it is saidTo-day, if, unto his voice, ye would hearken, do not harden your hearts,as in the embitterment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For, who, though they heard, caused embitterment? Nay, indeed! did not all who come forth out of Egypt through Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>But, with whom, was be sore vexed forty years? Was it not with them who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>But, unto whom, sware he, that they should not enter into his rest,save unto them who were obstinate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see, that they were not able to enter, because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us therefore fear, lest at any time, although there is left behind a promise of entering into his rest,any one from amongst you should be deemed, to have come short;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For we have had delivered to us the joyful message, just as even, they; but the word which was heard did not profit them, they not having been blended, by faith, with the things heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed, are to enter into the rest, according as he hath saidSo I sware in mine anger, They shall not enter into my rest; And yet, the works, from the foundation of the world, had been brought into existence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he hath spoken, somewhere, concerning the seventh   , thusAnd God rested, on the seventh day, from all his works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And in this againThey shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Seeing, therefore, that it is left over for, some, to enter into it, and, they who formerly had delivered to them the joyful message, entered not in by reason of obstinacy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>Again, he marketh out a certain day, To-day, in David, sayingafter so long a time as this,according as it hath been said before:To-day, if, unto his voice, ye would hearken, do not harden your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For, if, unto them, Joshua had given rest, it had not in that case, concerning another day, been speaking, after, these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Hence there is, left over, a Sabbath-keeping, for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For, he that hath entered into his rest, He too, hath rested from his works, just as, from his own, God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us, therefore, give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall into the same example, of obstinacy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For, living, is the word of God, and, energetic, and more cutting than any knife with two edges, and penetrating as far as a dividing asunder of soul and spirit, of joints also, and marrow, and able to judge the impulses and designs of the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is, no created thing, can be secreted before him, but, all things, are naked and exposed to his eyes:as to whom is, our discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having then a great high-priest who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a high-priest unable to have fellow-feeling with our weaknesses, but one tested in all respects, by way of likeness, apart from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us, then, be approaching with freedom of speech, unto the throne of favour, that we may receive mercy, and, favour, may find, for seasonable succour.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For, every high-priest who from among men is taken, on behalf of men, is appointed, as to the things pertaining unto God, that he may be offering  both  gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>Able, to have a measure of feeling, for the ignorant and erring,since, he also, is compassed with weakness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And, for this cause, is he obligedas for the people, so also, for himself,to be offering for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And, not unto himself, doth one take the honour, but when called by God, just as, even Aaron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus, also the Christ, glorified not himself to become a high-priest, but he that spake unto himMy Son, art, thou, I, this day, have begotten thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As also, in a different place, he saithThou, art a priest, age-abidingly, according to the rank of Melchizedek:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who, in the days of his flesh, having offered up, both supplications and entreaties unto him that was able to save him out of death, with mighty outcries and tears, and been hearkened to by reason of his devoutness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Even though he was a son, yet learned, from what things he suffered, obedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And, being made perfect, became, to all them that obey him, Author of salvation age-abiding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>Being addressed by God as high-priestaccording to the rank of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning whom, great, is our discourse, and of difficult interpretation, to express, seeing that, slothful, have ye become in the hearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For, even when ye ought to be teachers, by reason of the time, again, have ye, need, that one be teaching, you, what are the first principles of the oracles of God, and have become such as have, need, of milk, not, of strong food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For, every one partaking of milk, is unskilled in discourse of righteousness, for he is, a babe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But, to such as are mature, pertaineth, the strong food, to them who, by reason of habit, have their organs of perception well trained for discriminating both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore, dismissing the elementary discourse concerning the Christ, unto maturity, let us be tending, not, again, a foundation, laying downof repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>Of immersionsin respect of teaching, and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of judgment age-abiding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And, this, will we do, if at least, God, permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossibleas to these who have been, once for all, illuminated, who have tasted also of the heavenly free-gift, and have been made, partners, in a Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>And have tasted Gods utterance to be, sweet, mighty works also of a coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>And who have fallen away, again, to be remoulding them into repentance; seeing they are again crucifying unto themselves the Son of God, and holding him up as an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For, land, which hath drunk in, the rain, thereupon ofttimes coming, and which bringeth forth vegetation fit for them for whom it is even cultivated, partaketh of a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But, should it be bringing forth thorns and briars, it is disapproved, and, unto cursing, nigh,whose end is for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things which are better and which contain salvation, though, even thus we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For, not unrighteous, is God, to be forgetful of your work and of the love which ye have shewn forth for his name, in that ye have ministered unto the saints, and are ministering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we covet that, each one of you, be shewing forth the same diligence, unto the full assurance of the hope throughout:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>In order that, not slothful, ye may become, but imitators of them who, through faith and patience, were becoming heirs of the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For, when to Abraham God made promise, seeing he had no one greater by whom to swear, He sware, by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>sayingTruly, if blessing I will bless thee, and, multiplying, I will multiply thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And, thus, being patient, he attained unto the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For, men, by the greater one, swear, and, with them, an end of all gainsaying by way of confirmation is, the oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Wherein God, being, more abundantly disposed to shew forth unto the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his counsel, mediated, with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>In order that, through means of two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to make himself false, a mighty consolation, we might have, who have fled along to grasp, the fore-lying hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>Which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into the interior of the veil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>Where a forerunner in our behalf hath entered, even Jesus, who, according to the rank of Melchizedek, hath become, a high-priest unto times age-abiding.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To whom even a tenth of all Abraham apportioned, first, indeed, when translated, King of Righteousness, but, after that, King of Salem also, which is King of Peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>Without father, without mother, without pedigree, having, neither beginning of days, nor of life an end, but made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest evermore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider, how great, this man was, to whom, a tenth, Abraham gave out of the choicest spoils,   the Patriarch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And, they, indeed, from among the sons of Levi who the priesthood receive, have commandment to take tithes of the people, according to the law, that is, of their brethren, although sprung from the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But, he who deriveth not his pedigree from among them, hath taken tithes of Abraham. And, the holder of the promises, hath he blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>But, apart from all gainsaying, the less, by the greater, is blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And, here, indeed, dying men take tithes, but, there, one of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>Andso to say a wordthrough Abraham, even Levi who taketh tithes hath paid tithes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For, even then, was he, in the loins of his father, when, Melchizedek, met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If indeed, therefore, there had been, a perfecting through means of the Levitical priesthood,for, the people, thereon, have had based a code of laws, what further need, according to the rank of Melchizedek, for a different priest to be raised up, and, not according to the rank of Aaron, to be designated?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For, seeing there is to be a change of the priesthood, of necessity, of law too, a change cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For, he as to whom these things are said, with a different tribe, hath taken partnership, from which, no one, hath given attendance at the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is, very evident, that out of Judah hath sprung our Lord,respecting which tribe, concerning priests, nothing did Moses speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And, yet more abundantly evident it isthat, according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there is to be raised up, a different priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>Who, not according to a law of commandment dealing with the flesh, hath arisen, but according to the power of an indissoluble life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is witnessedThou, art a priest, age-abidingly, according to the rank of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For, a setting aside, doth, indeed, take place, of a foregoing commandment, by reason of its own weakness and unprofitableness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For, the law, perfected, nothing; but there is the superinducing of a better hope,through which we draw near unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And, inasmuch as not apart from oath-taking</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>For, they, indeed, apart from oath-taking, have been made priests, but, he, with an oath-taking, through him that was saying unto himThe Lord sware, and will not regret,Thou, art a priest, age-abidingly</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>By as much as this, hath, Jesus, become surety of a better covenant also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And, they, indeed, in greater numbers, have been made priests, because, by reason of death, are they hindered from remaining at hand;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>A crowning point on the things being spoken:such a one as this, have we, as high-priest, who hath sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>Of the Holy place, a public minister, and of the Real Tent, which, the Lord, pitched and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For, every high-priest, for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices, is constituted; whence it was necessary for, this one also, to have something which he might offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If, indeed, therefore, he had been on earth, he had not, in that case, even been a priest, since there are those who are offering the gifts, according to the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>Who, indeed, are rendering divine service, with a glimpse and shadow, of the heavenly things; even as Moses hath received intimation, when about to complete the tent,For see! saith heThou shalt make all things according to the model which hath been pointed out to thee in the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But, now, hath he attained unto, a more distinguished public ministry,by as much as of a better covenant also he is, mediator, which indeed, upon better promises, hath been legislated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For, if, that first, had been, faultless, not, in that case, for a second, had there been sought, a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For, finding fault with them, he saithLo! days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will conclude, for the house of Israel and the house of Judah, a covenant of a new sort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by their hand, to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt,because, they, abode not in my covenant, and, I, disregarded them, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>Because, this, is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord:giving my laws into their understanding, upon their hearts also, will I inscribe them: and I will become their God, and, they, shall become my people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And in nowise shall they teachevery one his fellow-citizen, and every one his brother, saying,Get to know the Lord! Because, all, shall know me, from the least unto the greatest of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>Because, propitious, will I be as to their unrighteousnesses, and, of their sins, in nowise will I be mindful, any more.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>the first, indeed, therefore, used to have righteous appointments of divine service, even the holy ritual well arranged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was prepared, the first, in which were both the lampstand and the table and the setting forth of the loaves,the which is called the Holy place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>But, after the second veil, a tent, that which is called Most Holy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>Having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant covered around on every side with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and the rod of Aaron that sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>But, over-above it, Cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiatory:concerning which things, it is not now   to be speaking, particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now, these things having been thus prepared, into the first tent, indeed, continually do the priests enter, the divine services completing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But, into the second, once for all in the year, only the high-priest, not without blood, which he offered for himself and the ignorances of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit making this evidentthat, not yet, hath been manifested, the way through the Holy place, so long as the first tent hath a standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>The which is a similitude for the present season, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot, as to the conscience, perfect him that rendereth the divine service:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>Only as to eatings, and drinkings, and diversified immersions,righteous-appointments of the flesh, which, until a season of rectifying, are in force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But, when Christ approached, as high-priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tent, not made by hand, that is, not of this creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Nor yet through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood he entered once for all into the Holy place, age-abiding redemption discovering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the profaned, halloweth unto the purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who through an age-abiding spirit offered himself unspotted unto God, purify our conscience from dead works, to the rendering of divine-service, unto a Living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And, for this cause, of a new covenant, is he mediator,to the end that, death coming to pass for the redemption of the transgressions against the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the age-abiding inheritance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For, where a covenant is, it is necessary for, the death, to be brought in, of him that hath covenanted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For, a covenant over dead persons, is firm,since it is not then of force when he is living that hath covenanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Whence, not even the first, apart from blood, hath been consecrated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For, when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses unto all the people, taking the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, both, the scroll itself, and all the people, he sprinkled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>SayingThis, is the blood of the covenant which, God, hath sent in command unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Yea, the tent also, and all the utensils of the public ministry, with blood, in like manner, he sprinkled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And, nearly, all things, with blood, are purified, according to the law, and, apart from blood-shedding, cometh no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was indeed therefore necessary for the glimpses of the things in the heavens with these to be purified; but, the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For, not into a Holy place made by hand, entered Christ,counterpart of the real   ; but, into the heaven itself, now, to be plainly manifested before the face of God in our behalf;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor yet that, ofttimes, he should be offering himself,just as the high-priest entereth into the Holy place, year by year, with alien blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>Else had it been needful for him, ofttimes, to suffer, from the foundation of the world; but, now, once for all, upon a conjunction of the ages, for a setting aside of sin through means of his sacrifice, hath he been made manifest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And, inasmuch as it is in store for menonce for all to die, but after this, judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>Thus, the Christ also, once for all having been offered, for the bearing of the sins, of many, a second time, apart from sin, will appear, to them who for him are ardently waitingunto salvation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And, every priest, indeed, standeth daily publicly ministering, and the same sacrifices ofttimes offering, the which never can clear away sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this priest, having offered one sacrifice for sins evermore, sat down on the right hand of God:</verse>
