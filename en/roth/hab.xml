      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <title>Behold me! against thee, Declareth Yahweh of hosts, Therefore will I burn up in smoke her chariots, and, thy young lions, shall be devoured by the sword,so will I cut off, out of the earth, thy prey, nor shall be heard any more, the voice of thine envoy.</title>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The oracle of which Habakkuk the prophet, had vision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>How long, O Yahweh, have I called out, and thou wouldst not hear me? Have I kept crying unto thee of violence, and thou wouldst not save?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Wherefore shouldst thou let me see iniquity, and, wrong, shouldst let me behold, and, force and violence, be straight before me,and there should have ever been someone who, contention and strife, would uphold?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>For which cause, benumbed is the law, and there is never any going forth of justice,for, the lawless, doth circumvent the righteous, for which cause, justice doth go forth perverted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Behold ye, among the nations, and look around, Yea stand stock stillstare,for, a work, is being wrought in your days, ye will not believe, when it is recounted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For, behold me! raising up the Chaldeans, the bitter and headlong nation,that marcheth to the breadths of the earth, to take possession of habitations, not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>Awful and fearful, is he,from himself, his decision and his uprising, proceed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Then, swifter than leopards, are his horses, and, more sharply they attack, than evening wolves, and forward have leapt his chargers,Yea, his chargers, from afar, will come in, they will fly as an eagle hath hastened to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>Solely for violence, will he come, the intent of their faces, isTo the east! And he hath gathered, as the sand, a captive host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And, he, over kings, will make merry, and, nobles, will be a scorn to him: he, at any fortress, will laugh, once he hath heaped up dust, he hath captured it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then, hath he become arrogant in spirit, and hath committed excess, and so is guilty,this his violence, is due to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>Art not, thou, from of old, O Yahweh, my God, my Holy One? Thou diest not! O Yahweh, to judgment, hast thou appointed him, and, O Rock, to correction, hast thou devoted him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>whose eyes are too pure to look with approval on wrong, to respect oppression, canst not endure,Wherefore, shouldst thou respect the treacherous? Be silent, when the lawless, swalloweth up, one more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>So wouldst thou have made Men, like the fishes of the sea,like the creeping thing that hath no ruler over it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>All of which, with a hook, one bringeth up, raketh together with his drag, and hath gathered with his net,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>On which account, he is glad and exulteth: on which account, he sacrificeth to his Net, and burneth incense to his Drag; because, thereby, rich, is his portion, and his foodfatness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall he, on this account, empty his net? And, the continual slaying of nations, deem to be no pity?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>Upon my watch-tower, will I stand, and will station myself upon the bulwark,so will I keep outlook, to seewhat he will speak with me, and what I shall reply, when I am reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>Then Yahweh answered me, and said, Write the vision, Yea, make it plain on tablets, that one may swiftly read it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For yet is the vision for an appointed time, still, it presseth towards an end, and will not deceive,if it tarry, wait thou for it, for it, surely cometh,will not be too late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Lo! as for the conceited one, crooked is his soul within him,- but, one who is righteous, by his faithfulness, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>Moreover also, when wine betrayeth, a man, is arrogant, and findeth no rest,because he hath enlarged, like hades, his desire, yea, he, is like death, and cannot be satisfied,but hath gathered unto himself, all the nations, and assembled unto himself, all the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not, these, all of them, against him, take upa taunt, a mocking poem, enigmatical sentencesconcerning him? And sayAlas! for him who maketh abundance in what is not his own, How long? that he should be burdening himself with heavy debts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Will not thy creditors, suddenly rise up? and they who shall violently shake thee, all at once become active? Then shalt thou serve for booties, unto them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because, thou, hast plundered many nations, all the residue of the peoples, shall plunder thee,for shedding Human blood, and doing violence to the earth, to the city, and to all who dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Alas! for him who extorteth an extortion of wrong for his own house,that he may set on high his nest, that he may be delivered from the grasp of calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>Thou hast counseled shame to thy housemaking an end of many peoples, and endangering thine own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>Surely, the stone out of the wall, will make outcry,and, the tie out of the timber, will answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Alas! for him who buildeth a city with deeds of blood,and establisheth a town with perversity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Lo! is it not from Yahweh of hoststhat peoples labour for fire, and, populations, for emptiness, weary themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh,as, the waters, cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Alas! for him who causeth his neighbour to drink, from the goblet of thy fury, and also, making him drunk,to the end thou mayest gloat over their parts of shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>Thou art sated with contempt, more than glory, drink, thou too, and expose thy person,the cup of the right hand of Yahweh, shall come round unto thee, and ignominious filth be upon thy glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For, the violence   to Lebanon, shall cover thee, and wasting by wild beasts shall cause them terror,for shedding Human blood, and doing violence to the earth, to the city, and to all who dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What hath a carved image, profited, though the fashioner thereof, carved it? a molten image, and a teacher of falsehood,though the fashioner of his fashioned thing trusted therein? that men should make Dumb Nonentities!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Alas! for him who saith to wood, Awake, bestir thee! to a silent stone, he, shall teach! Though he is overlaid with gold and silver, yet, no spirit whatsoever, is in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>Howbeit, Yahweh, is in his holy temple,Hush before him, all the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'>A prayer by Habakkuk the prophet,in the manner of an Ode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'>O Yahweh, I have heard tidings of thee, I am afraid. O Yahweh! Thy workin the midst of the years, O revive it, in the midst of the years, wilt thou make known? In trouble, wilt thou remember, compassion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'>GOD, from Teman, cometh in, and, the Holy One, from Mount Paran. Selah. His splendour, hath covered the heavens, and, his praise, hath filled the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'>And, a brightness, as light, appeareth, Rays, out of his hand, hath he,and, there, is the hiding of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'>Before him, marcheth pestilence,and fever, goeth forth, at his feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'>He hath stood and measured the earth, he hath looked, and caused nations to tremble, and, scattered as dust, are the perpetual mountains, and, sunk, are the age-abiding hills,Forthgoings age-abiding, are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'>Under distress, saw I the tents of Ethiopia,tremble, do the curtains of the land of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'>Against the rivers, is Yahweh wroth? Against the rivers, is thine anger? Against the sea, is thine indignation? For thou wilt ride on Thy horses, Thy chariots,   salvation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'>To nakedness, is bared thy bow, oaths of chastisementsong! Selah. With rivers, thou dost cleave open the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'>The mountains, have seen theethey tremble, a downpour of waters, hath passed along,the roaring deep, hath given forth, his voice, on highhis hand, hath he uplifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'>Sun, moon, have stood still, on high,like light, thine arrows, speed along, like brightness, is the flash of thy spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'>In wrath, dost thou stride through the land,in anger, dost thou thresh the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'>Thou hast come forth to the salvation of thy people, to salvation, with thine Anointed One,Thou hast crushed the Head out of the house of the lawless one, baring the foundation up to the neck, Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'>Thou hast pierced, with his own staves, the head of his chiefs, they storm along, to scatter me,their exultant thought, is, in very deed, to devour the oppressed one, in a secret place!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'>Thou hast driven, into the sea, thy chariot-horses. Foaming are the mighty waters!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'>I heard, and I trembled within me, at the voice, my lips, quivered, decay, entered, my bones, and, in my limbs, I trembled,though I am to find rest, in the day of distress, when their invader, cometh up against the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'>Though, the fig-tree, should not blossom, and there be no sprouting in the vines, the yield of the olive, should have deceived, and, the fields, not have brought forth food,the flock, have been consumed out of the fold, and there be no herd in the stalls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'>Yet, I, in Yahweh, will rejoice,I will exult in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'>Yahweh, My Lord, is my strength, therefore hath he made my feet like hinds, and, upon my high places, will he cause me to march along. To the chief musician, on my double harp.</verse>
