        <title>Howbeit, Yahweh, is in his holy temple,Hush before him, all the earth.</title>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.1'>The word of Yahweh which came unto Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah,in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.2'>I will take clean away everything from off the face of the ground, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.3'>I will take away man and beast, I will take away the bird of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks, even them who are lawless,and will cut off mankind, from off the face of the ground, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>And I will stretch out my handover Judah, and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,and will cut off out of this place, the name of Baal, the name of the priestlings, with the priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>And them who bow down upon the housetops to the host of the heavens,and them who bow downwho swear to Yahweh, and swear by Milcom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>And them who turn away from following Yahweh,and have neither sought Yahweh, nor enquired for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Hush! at the presence of My Lord, Yahweh,for, near, is the day of Yahweh, for Yahweh hath prepared his sacrifice, hath hallowed his guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>And it shall come to pass, in the day of Yahwehs sacrifice, that I will punish the rulers, and the sons of the king,and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>And I will punish every one who leapeth over the threshold, in that day,those who fill the house of their lords with violence and deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>And there shall come to be, in that day, declareth Yahweh, The noise of an outcry from the fish-gate, and of a howling out of the new city,and of a great crashing, from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>Howl, ye inhabitants of the lower city,because destroyed are all the people of traffic, cut off are all they who were laden with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>And it shall come to pass, at that time, that I will search through Jerusalem, with lamps,and will punish the men who are thickened upon their lees, who are saying in their heart, Yahweh, will not give blessing, neither will he bring calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>Therefore shall their goods become a booty, and their houses, a desolation,and they shall build houses, but not inhabit them, and plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>Near is the great day of Yahweh, near, and very speedy,The noise of the day of Yahweh, a strong manthere!bitterly crying out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>A day of indignation,that day! day of danger and distress, day of rush, and of crash, day of obscurity, and deep gloom, day of cloud, and thick darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>day of horn, and war-shout,against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>And I will bring distress to mankind, and they shall walk like them who are blind, because, against Yahweh, have they sinned,and their blood, shall be poured out, as dust, and their bowels like dung.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.18'>Neither their silver nor yet their gold, shall be able to deliver them, in the day of the indignation of Yahweh, but, in the fire of his jealousy, shall the whole earth be consumed; For, a destruction, surely a terrible one, will he make, with all them who dwell in the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Collect your thoughts, aye collect them,O nation, depressed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>Ere yet the decree, have given birth, like chaff, the day, have vanished,ere yet shall come upon you, the glow of the anger of Yahweh, ere yet shall come upon you, the day of the anger of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek Yahwehall ye lowly of the land, who have wrought, what he appointed,seek righteousness, seek humility, peradventure, ye shall be concealed, in the day of the anger of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For, Gaza, forsaken, shall be, and, Ashkelon, a desolation,Ashdod! at high noon, shall they drive her forth, and, Ekron, be uprooted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>Alas! for the inhabitants of the line of the sea, the nation of Kerethim,The word of Yahweh, is against you, O Canaan of the land of the Philistines, therefore will I destroy thee, to the last inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.6'>So shall the line of the sea become a meadow, the wells of shepherds, and the folds of flocks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>And the line shall belong to the remnant of the house of Judah, Thereon, shall they feed their flocks,In the houses of Ashkelon, shall they, at eventide, lie down, for Yahweh their God will visit them, and bring their captives back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon,who have reproached my people, and have magnified themselves up to their bounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>Wherefore, as I live, declareth Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, Surely, Moab, like Sodom, shall become, and, the sons of Ammon, like Gomorrah, a possession for the thorn, and a pit of salt, Yea a desolation, unto times age-abiding: The remnant of my people, shall make of them a prey, and, the residue of my nation, shall inherit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>This, shall they have, instead of their pride,because they reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>Terrible will Yahweh be against them, for he hath caused to waste away all the gods of the earth, that men may bow down to him, every one from his place, all the coastlands of the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>Even ye Ethiopians, the slain of my sword were they!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>And may he stretch out his hand against the North, and destroy Assyria,and may he make of Nineveh a desolation, dry as the desert!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.14'>So shall lie down in her midstflocks, each living thing of a nation, both pelican and bittern, in her capitals, shall roost,a voice, shall resound in the window, the bustard, on the sill, for he hath destroyed, hath laid bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>This, is the city exultant, that sat secure, that said in her heart, I,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Alas for her that is rebellious, and polluted, the city that oppresseth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She hath hearkened to no voice, accepted no correction; in Yahweh, hath not trusted, to her God, hath not drawn near:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her rulers in her midst, are roaring lions,her judges, evening wolves, they have left nothing until morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets, are reckless, treacherous men! her priests, have profaned the holy, done violence to law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>Yahweh, the Righteous One, is in her midst, he dealeth not perversely,Morning by morning, his justice, bringeth he forth the light, He is not found lacking, but the perverse man knoweth no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>I have cut off nations, deserted are their towers, have made desolate their streets, that none passeth through; ruined are their cities, for want of men of note, from lack of any dweller!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>I said, Surely thou wilt reverence, Me, wilt accept correction, lest her abode, should be cut of, howsoever I had punished her; but, in truth, they soon corrupted all their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.8'>Wherefore, wait for me, urgeth Yahweh, until the day when I rise up as witness, for, my decision, is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, to pour out on them mine indignation, all the glow of mine anger, for, in the fire of my jealousy, shall be devoured the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>Surely, then, will I turn unto the peoples a lip made pure,that they all may call on the name of Yahweh, may serve him with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.10'>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,   my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed ones, shall bear along a gift for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.11'>In that day, wilt thou not turn pale for all thy deeds, wherein thou hast transgressed against me? For, then, will I take away out of thy midst thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt not again be haughty any more in my holy mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.12'>So will I leave remaining in thy midst, a people oppressed and poor,who will seek refuge in the name of Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.13'>The remnant of Israelwill not do perversity, nor speak falsehood, neither shall there be found in their mouth a tongue of deceit,surely, they, shall feed and lie down, with none to make them afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.14'>Sing out, O daughter of Zion, shout aloud, O Israel,rejoice and exult with all thy heart, O daughter Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.15'>Yahweh, hath set aside, thy judgments, hath turned back thy foe,The king of Israel, Yahweh, is in thy midst, thou shalt not fear calamity, any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.16'>In that day, shall it be saidto Jerusalem, Do not fear,O Zion, Let not thy hands hang down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.17'>Yahweh, thy God, in the midst of thee, as a mighty one, will save,will be glad over thee with rejoicing, will be silent in his love, will exult over thee with shouts of triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.18'>The sad exiles from the appointed meeting, have I gathered, from thee, had they been!   a burden on theea reproach!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.19'>Behold me! dealing with all thine oppressors, at that time,and I will save her that is lame, and, her that hath been an outcast, will I carry, and I will make them to be a Praise and a Name, in the whole earth that hath witnessed their shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.20'>At that time, will I bring you in, even at the time when I gather you,Yea I will grant you to become a Name and a Praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I cause them of your captivities to return before your eyes, saith Yahweh.</verse>
