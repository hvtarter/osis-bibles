        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>A wise man, will hear, and will increase learning, and a, discreet man, wise counsels, will acquire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>By gaining discernment of proverb, and satire, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The reverence of Yahweh, is the beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and correction, the foolish have despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, the correction of thy father, and do not reject the instruction of thy mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For, a wreath of beauty, shall they be to thy head, and chains of ornament, to thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they sayCome with us,Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us watch in secret for him who is needlessly innocent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us engulf them, like hades, alive, While in health, like them who are going down to the pit;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Thy lot, shalt thou cast into our midst, One purse, shall there be, for us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, do not walk in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For, their feet, to mischief, do run, and haste to the shedding of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely, in vain, is spread the net, in the sight of aught that hath wings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>Yet, they, for their own blood, lie in wait, They watch in secret for their own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>Such are the ways of every one that graspeth with greed, The life of the owners thereof, it taketh away!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Will ye turn, at my reproof? Lo! I will pour out to you my spirit, I will make known my words to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I called, and ye refused, I stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But ye dismissed all my counsel, and, to my rebuke, would not yield,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also, at your calamity, will laugh, I will mock, when cometh your dread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When cometh as a crashing your dread, and, your calamity, as a storm-wind, overtaketh, when there come upon you, distress and anguish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then, will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me diligently, but shall not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge, and, the reverence of Yahweh, did not choose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>Consented not to my counsel, disdained all my rebuke,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and, with their own counsels, be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For, the turning away of the simple, will slay them,and, the carelessness of dullards, will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>Whereas, he that hearkeneth unto me, shall dwell safely, and be at rest, without dread of misfortune.</verse>
