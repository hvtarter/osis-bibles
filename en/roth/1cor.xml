        <title>Now, the God of peace, be with you all. Amen.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through Gods will,and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>Unto the assembly of God which is in Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints,with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place,their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks unto my God, at all times, concerning you, by reason of the favour of God given unto you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>That, in everything, ye have been enriched in himin all discourse and in all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>Even as, the witness of the Christ, hath been confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>So that ye come short in no gift of favour,ardently awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>Who will also confirm you unto the end, unaccusable in the day of our Lord Jesus  Christ :</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>Faithful, is God, through whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>But I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,that, the same thing, ye, all, be saying, and that there be not, among you, divisions; but that ye be fitly joined togetherin the same mind, and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been signified unto me, concerning you, my brethren,by them who are of   Chloe,that there are strifes among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now I mean this,that, each one of you, is sayingI, indeed, am of Paul, but, I, of Apollos, but, I, of Cephas, but, I, of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>The Christ is divided! Was, Paul, crucified for you? Or, into the name of Paul, were ye immersed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks, that, none of you, did I immersesave Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>Lest any should sayinto my own name, I immersed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yea! I immersed the house of Stephanas also,besides, I know not whether, anyone else, I immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ sent me not, to be immersing, but to be telling the good news,not with wisdom of discourse, lest, void should be made, the cross of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For, the discourse which concerneth the cross, unto them, indeed, who are perishing, is, foolishness; but, unto them who are being savedunto us, it is, Gods power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is writtenI will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and, the discernment of the discerning, will I set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For, seeing that, in the wisdom of God, the world, through its wisdom, did not get to knew God, God was well-pleasedthrough the foolishness of the thing proclaimed, to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Seeing that both, Jews for signs, do ask, and, Greeks for wisdom, do seek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>Whereas, we, proclaim a Christ who hath been crucified,unto Jews, indeed, an occasion of stumbling, and, unto Gentiles, foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But, unto the called themselvesboth Jews and Greeks, Christ, Gods power, and, Gods wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because, Gods foolish thing, is, wiser than men, and, Gods weak thing, mightier than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For be looking at the calling of you, brethren,that   not many wise, according to flesh. Not many powerful, not many high-born:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>On the contrarythe foolish things of the world, hath God chosen, that he might put to shame them who are wise, and, the weak things of the world, hath God chosen, that he might put to shame the things that are mighty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And, the low-born things of the world, and the things that are despised, hath God chosen, and  the things that are not,that, the things that are, he might bring to nought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>So that no flesh should boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But, of him, are, ye, in Christ Jesus, who hath been made wisdom unto us, from God,both righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>In order that, even as it is writtenHe that boasteth, in the Lord, let him boast.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>I, therefore, brethren, when I came unto you, came, not with excellency of discourse or wisdom, declaring unto you the mystery of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I had not determined to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,and, him, as one who had been crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I, therefore in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, came to be with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And, my discourse, and what I proclaimed, were not in suasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of Spirit and power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>In order that, your faith, might not be in mens wisdom, but in Gods power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Wisdom, however, we do speak, among the full-grown,wisdom, indeed, not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are to come to nought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak, Gods, wisdom, in a sacred secret, that hidden   , which God marked out beforehand, before the ages, for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which, none of the rulers of this age had come to know, for, had they known, not, in that case, the Lord of the glory, would they have crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But, even as it is writtenThe things which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and upon the heart of man have not come up,whatsoever things God hath prepared for them that love him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>Unto us, in fact, hath God revealed through the Spirit; for, the Spirit, into all things, maketh search, yea! the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who of men knoweth the things of a man,save the spirit of the man that is in him? thus, even the things of God, hath no one come to know, save the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But, as for us,not the spirit of the world, have we received, but the Spirit which is of God,that we might know the things which, by God, have been given in favour unto us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which we also speaknot in words taught of human wisdom, but in such as are taught of   Spirit, by spiritual words, spiritual things, explaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But, a man of the soul, doth not welcome the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, and he cannot get to know them, because, spiritually, are they examined;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But, the man of the spirit, on the one hand, examineth all things, but, on the other, he himself, by no one, is examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath come to know the mind of the Lord, that shall instruct him? But, we, have, the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>I, therefore, brethren, have not been able to speak unto you, as unto men of the Spirit, but as unto men of the fleshas unto babes in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>With milk, have I fed you, not, with meat; for, not yet, have ye been able;nay! not  yet  even now, are ye able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For ye are yet fleshly. For, whereas there are, among you, jealousy and strife, are ye not, fleshly, and, after the manner of men, walking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For, as soon as one beginneth to sayI, indeed, am of Paul! and anotherI, of Apollos! are ye not, men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? and, what is Paul? ministers through whom ye believed, and, each, as the Lord, gave to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I, planted, Apollos, watered,but, God, caused to, grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So that,   is he that planteth anything, nor, he that watereth,but, God, who causeth to, grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Moreover, he that planteth and he that watereth, are one:howbeit, each one, his own reward, shall receive,according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are, Gods, fellow-workmen: ye are, Gods, farm, Gods building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the favour of God which hath been given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I laid a foundation, whereas, another, is building thereon; but, let each one, see, how he buildeth thereon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For, other foundation, can, no one, lay, than that which is lying, which is, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>But, if anyone is building, upon the foundationgold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>Each ones work, shall be made, manifest; for, the day, will make it plain, because, by fire, is it to be revealed,and, each ones work, of what sort it is, the fire itself will prove:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If, anyones work, shall abide, which he built, a reward, shall he receive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If, anyones work, shall be burnt up, he shall suffer loss, but shall, himself, be savedthough, thus, as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not that ye are a shrine a of God, and that the Spirit of God within you doth dwell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone doth mar the shrine of God, God, will mar him; for the shrine of God is holy,and such are ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one be deceiving himself:if anyone imagineth himself to be wise among you, in this age, let him become foolish, that he may become wise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For, the wisdom of this world, is, foolishness with God; for it is writtenHe that taketh the wise in their knavery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And againThe Lord taketh note of the speculations of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then, let, no one, be boasting in men; for, all things, are yours</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all, are, yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And, ye, are Christs,and, Christ, is, Gods.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man, so, be reckoning of us, as officers of Christ, and stewards of sacred secrets of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards, that, faithful, one be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>With me, however, it counteth for the very smallest thing, that, by you, I should be examined, or by a human day. Nay! I am not even examining myself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For, of nothing, to myself, am I conscious: nevertheless, not hereby, am I declared righteous, but, he that doth examine me, is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So then, not before the fitting time, be judging anything,until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and, then, the praise shall come to each one, from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>But, these things, brethren, have I transferred unto myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that, in us, ye might learn</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? But, if thou didst even receive it, why dost thou boast, as though thou hadst not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already, ye have become full, already, ye are become rich,apart from us, ye are become kings! And I would indeed ye had become kings, that, we also, with you, might have together become kings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that, God, hath set forth, us the apostles, to be last of all, as men devoted to death,in that, a spectacle, have we been made, unto the world,both unto messengers and unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We, are foolish for Christs sake, but, ye, prudent in Christ; we are weak, but, ye, mighty; ye, all-glorious, but, we, dishonoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Until the present hour, we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and are wanderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless, being persecuted, we hold on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>Being defamed, we beseech: as the sweepings of the world have we become, the offscouring of alluntil even now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not, to shame you, write I these things; but, as my beloved children, I admonish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For, though myriads of tutors ye should have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for, in Christ Jesus, through means of the joyful message, I, begat you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I beseech you, therefore,become imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause, sent I unto you, Timothy,who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put, you, in mind of my ways which are in Christ  Jesus , even as, everywhere, in every assembly, I teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>But, as though I were not coming unto you, some are puffed up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>Howbeit, I will come quickly unto you,if, the Lord, please,and will get to knownot the speech of them who are puffed up, but, the power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For, not in speech, is the kingdom of God, but, in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? that, with a rod, I should come unto you? or, with love, and a spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>On all hands, there is reported to be among youfornication, and such fornication as thiswhich, not among the nations,   ,as that one should have, his fathers wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And, ye, have become puffed up, and have not rather mourned, in order that he might be removed out of your midst, who, this deed, hath wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For, I, indeed,being absent in the body, but present in the spirit, have already judged, as present, him who, thus, this thing hath perpetrated:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>To deliver such a one as this, unto Satan, for the destruction of the flesh,that, the spirit, may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Unseemly, is your boast! Know ye not that, a little leaven, doth leaven, the whole of the lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge ye out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump,even as ye are unleavened; for, our passover, hath even been sacrificedChrist:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So then, let us be keeping the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of baseness and wickedness,but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote a unto you in my letternot to be mixing yourselves up with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Not at all,   the fornicators of this world, or the covetous and extortioners, or idolaters,else had ye been obliged, in that case, to go out of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But, now, I have written unto you not to be mixing yourselves up,if anyone named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one as this, not so much, as to be eating together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do to be judging them who are without? Do, ye, not judge, them who are within,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>Whereas, them who are without, God, judgeth? Remove ye the wicked man from among, yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having, a matter against his brother, sue for judgment before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or know ye not that, the saints, shall judge the world? And, if, by you, the world, is to be judged, unworthy are ye of the smallest judgment-seats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know ye not that we shall judge, messengers? and not, then, matters of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If, then, for matters of this, life ye have judgment-seats, them who are of no account in the assembly, these, are ye seating thereupon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>With a view to shame you, am I speaking. So, is it possible that there is among younot so much as one wise man, who shall be able to judge between his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But, brother with brother, sueth for judgment, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already, indeed, it is an utter defeat for you, that ye are having, law-suits, one with another. Wherefore are ye not rather taking wrong? Wherefore are ye not rather suffering yourselves to be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Nay! but, ye, are doing wrong, and defrauding,and that</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or know ye not that, wrong-doers, shall not inherit, Gods kingdom? Be not deceiving yourselves:neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionersshall inherit, Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And, these things, were some of you; but ye bathed them away,but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified, in the name of  our  Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things, unto me, are allowable, but, not all things, are profitable: all things, unto me, are allowable, but, I, will not be brought under authority by any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; but, God, will set aside, both it and them. The body, however, is not for fornication, but, for the Lord,and, the Lord, for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>God, moreover, hath both raised up, the Lord, and will raise, us, up from among   through his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know ye not that, your bodies, are, members of Christ? Shall I, then, take away the members of the Christ and make them members of a harlot? Far be it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Or know ye not that, he that joineth himself unto the harlot, is, one body? For, saith he, the two, shall become, one flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But, he that joineth himself unto the Lord, is, one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee fornication! Every sin, whatsoever a man shall commit, is, outside his body, but, he that committeth fornication, bringeth sin into his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or know ye not that, your body, is, a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you, which ye have from God? And ye are not your own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For ye have been bought with a price! Therefore glorify God in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must needs clothe itself with incorruptibility, and this mortal, clothe itself, with immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But, whensoever, this mortal, shall clothe itself with immortality, then, shall be brought to pass the saying that is writtenDeath hath been swallowed up, victoriously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>Where, O death, is thy victory? Where, O death, is thy sting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>Now, the sting of death, is, sin, and, the power of sin, is, the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But, unto God, be thanks, who is giving unto us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So, then, my beloved brethren,become ye, steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord, at all times; knowing that, your toil, is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I do not wish to see you, just now, by the way; for I hope to remain, some time, with you,if, the Lord, permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.8'>But I remain in Ephesus, until the Pentecost,</verse>
