        <title>and will plant his palace-home between the seas, towards the beautiful holy mountain, but shall come to his end, with none to help him.</title>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of Yahweh which came unto Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah,and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>The beginning of the word of Yahweh with Hosea, was,that Yahweh said unto Hosea, Go take thee a woman of unchastity, and the children of unchastity, for, unchastely indeed, hath the land been going away from following Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer, daughter of Diblaim,and she conceived and bare him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>Then said Yahweh unto him, Call his name Jezreel: for, yet a little, and I will visit the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>And it shall come to pass, in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel, in the vale of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>Then conceived she again and bare a daughter, and he said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah   ,for, not again any more, will I have compassion upon the house of Israel, that I should, forgive, them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>but, on the house of Judah, will I have compassion, and I will save them, as Yahweh their God,but will not save them by bow, or by sword, or by battle, by horses, or by horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>And, when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>Then said he, Call his name Lo-ammi,for ye are Lo-ammi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet shall the number of the sons of Israel become like the sand of the sea, which can neither he measured, nor numbered,and it shall come to pass, in the place where it used to be said to them, No people of mine, are ye, it shall be said to them, Sons of a Living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>Then shall the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel, gather themselves together, as one, and shall appoint them one head, and come up out of the earth,for great shall be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>Say ye unto your brethren, O Ammi, and unto your sisters, O Ruhamah: \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend ye with your mother, contend, for she is no wife of mine, and I am no husband of hers, Let her then put away her paramours from before her, and her partners in adultery, from her embraces:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip off her under-clothing, and set her forth to view, as in the day she was born,and make her like a wilderness, and render her like a land that is parched, and suffer her to die of thirst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>And, on her children, not have compassion,because, the children of paramours, they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother, hath been unchaste, and she that conceived them, hath caused shame,for she said, Let me go after my lovers! who used to give my bread, and my water, my wool, and my flax, mine oil, and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold me! hedging up her way, with thorns,and I will wall her in, and, her footpaths, shall she not find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>And, when she shall pursue her lovers, and not overtake them, and shall seek them and not find, then will she say, Let me go my way now! and return unto my first husband, for it was better with me, then, than, now!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>But, she, owneth not, that, I, gave herthe corn, and the new wine and the oil,silver, also increased I unto her, and gold  they offered to Baal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore, will I again take away my corn, in the time thereof, and my new wine, in the season thereof,and will recover my wool and my flax   to hide her shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>Now, therefore, will I expose her unseemliness, before the eyes of her lovers,and no, man, shall deliver her out of my hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>And I will cause to cease all her mirth, her pilgrim-festival, her new moon and her sabbath,and her every appointed meeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>And will lay waste her vine and her fig- tree, as to which she hath said, A present, are they for myself, which my lovers, have given me,and I will make of them a thicket, and the wild beasts of the field shall devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>So will I visit upon her the days of the Baals, unto whom she used to burn incense, and decked herself with her nose-ring and her jewelry, and went her way after her lovers,whereas, me, she forgat, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>Therefore, lo! I, am going to persuade her, and, though I conduct her forth into wilderness, yet will I speak unto her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>Then will I give to her her vineyards from thence, and the vale of Achor for a door of hope,and she will respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>And it shall come to pass, in that day, Declareth Yahweh, that she will call me Ishi, and will not call me any more, Baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>So will I take away the names of the Baals, out of her mouth,and they shall not be called to mind any more, by their name. \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>And I will solemnize to them a covenant, in that day, with the wild-beast of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the ground,and, bow and sword and battle, will I break in pieces out of the land, so will I cause them to lie down, in security.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>And I will take thee unto myself, unto times age-abiding,yea I will take thee unto myself, in righteousness and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in abounding compassion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>Yea I will take thee unto myself, in faithfulness,So shalt thou know Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will respond, Declareth Yahweh, I will respond to the heavens,and, they, shall respond to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>And, the earth, shall respond to the corn, and to the new wine and to the oil,and, they, shall respond to Jezreel \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>So will I sow her unto me in the land, and will have compassion upon the uncompassionated one,and will say to him who was No-people-of-mine, My people, thou art, and, he, shall say, My God! \fs15</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Then said Yahweh unto me, Once more, go love a woman who loveth a friend, and is an adulteress,according to the love of Yahweh unto the sons of Israel, though they keep turning away unto other gods, and love   raisin-cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I secured n her to me, for fifteen pieces of silver,and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>and I said unto her, Many days, shalt thou tarry for me, thou shalt not be unchaste, neither shalt thou become another mans,moreover also, I,   for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For, many days, shall the sons of Israel tarry, without king, and without ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillar; and without ephod, or household gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterwards, shall the sons of Israel return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king,and shall turn with throbbing hearts unto Yahweh and unto his goodness, in the afterpart of the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of Yahweh, ye sons of Israel,that, a controversy, hath Yahweh with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no faithfulness, nor lovingkindness, nor knowledge of God, in the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>Cursing and lying, and killing and stealing, and committing adultery, have broken forth, and, blood-shedding, unto blood-shedding, doth extend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>For this cause, shall the land mourn, and everyone who dwelleth therein shall languish, with the wild beast of the field and with the bird of the heavens,moreover also, the fishes of the sea, shall be withdrawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Howbeit let, no man, contend, nor let him rebuke another,since, thy people, are as they who contend against a priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>So shouldst thou stumble in the daytime, and even the prophet stumble with thee, in the night,and I should destroy thine own mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people, are destroyed, for lack of knowledge,Because, thou, hast rejected knowledge, therefore will I reject thee from ministering as priest unto me, and, because thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also, will forget thy children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were magnified, so, they sinned against me,My gloryfor what was contemptible, did they exchange.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>The sin of my people, they do eat,and. unto their iniquity, lift they up every man his desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>So doth it come to belike people, like priest,therefore will I visit upon him his ways, and, his doings, will I bring back to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>And they shall eat, and not be satisfied, they have encouraged unchastity, yet have not been making increase,for unto, Yahweh, have they left off giving heed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Unchastity, and wine, and new wine, take away the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people, of their Wood, do ask,Let, their Staff, then tell them,for, the spirit of unchastity, hath led them astray, and they have unchastely departed from under their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>On the headlands of the mountains, they sacrifice, and, on the hills, burn they incense, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because, pleasant, is the shade thereof: For this cause, do your daughters, become unchaste, and, your brides, commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I do not bring punishment upon your daughters when they become unchaste, nor upon your brides, when they commit adultery, for, the men themselves, with unchaste women, do seclude themselves, and, with the common women of the shrine, do offer sacrifice,and, a people who will not discern, must be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though unchaste art thou, O Israel, let not Judah, become guilty, neither let them enter Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, and   swear, By the life of Yahweh!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For, as a heifer that is stubborn, hath Israel, been stubborn,Now, can Yahweh, turn them out to pasture, like a young ram in a wide place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Mated with idols, is Ephraim, let him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drinking-bout, having passed,they became, unchaste, they loved wildly, a contempt, became her great men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind hath bound her up in its wings,that they may be ashamed, because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>Hear ye thisO priests, and attend, O house of Israel, and ye, House of the King, give ear, for, to you, pertaineth the sentence,for, a snare, have ye been to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>And, a slaughter, have apostates deeply designed,though, I, was a rebuker to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I, have known Ephraim, and, Israel, hath not been hidden from me,for, now, hast thou committed unchastity, O Ephraim, Israel, hath made himself impure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their doings, will not suffer, them to return unto their God,for, the spirit of unchastity, is within them, and, Yahweh, have they not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>Therefore will the Excellency of Israel, answer, to his face,and, Israel and Ephraim, shall stumble in their iniquity, even Judah with them, hath stumbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>With their flocks and with their herds, will they go to seek Yahweh, but shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>With Yahweh, have they dealt treacherously, for, to alien children, have they given birth,now, a new moon, shall devour them, with their portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>Blow ye a horn in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah,sound an alarm at Beth-aven, behind thee, O Benjamin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim, shall become, a desolation, in the day of rebuke: Throughout the tribes of Israel, have I hide known what is sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The rulers of Judah have become as they who remove a land-mark. Upon them, will I pour out, like water, my wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Oppressed, is Ephraim, crushed in judgment,because he hath, wilfully, walked after falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>But, I, was like a moth, to Ephraim,and like rotten wood to the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>When Ephraim, saw, his injury, and Judah his wound, then went Ephraim unto Assyria, and   sent unto a hostile king,yet, he, cannot heal you, nor will the wound, remove from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For, I, will be as a lion unto Ephraim, and as a young lion to the house of Judah,I, I, will tear in pieces, and depart, I will carry off, and none be able to rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will depart, will return unto my place! till what time they acknowledge their guilt, and seek my face,In their trouble, will they make for me diligent search.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>Come, and let us return unto Yahweh! for, he, hath torn, that he might heal us,smitten, that he might bind us up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>He will bring us to life, after two days,on the third day, will he raise us up, that we may live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Then let us knowlet us press on to knowYahweh, Like the dawn, is his coming forth assured,that he may come like a down-pour upon us, like the harvest-rain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>What can I do unto thee, O Ephraim? What can I do unto thee, O Judah? for, your lovingkindness, is like a morning cloud, yea, like the dew, early departing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>For this cause, have I hewn them in pieces by the prophets, I have slain them by the sayings of my mouth,and, my justice, as a light goeth forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For, lovingkindness, I desired, and not sacrifice,and the knowledge of God, more than ascending-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But, they, like Adam, have transgressed a covenant,There, have they dealt treacherously with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead, is a city of workers of iniquity,tracked with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>And, like liers in wait for a man, in troops, is a band of priests, on the road, will they murder towards Shechem,because, a shameful deed, they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel, have I seen a horrible thing,there, the unchastity of Ephraim, defiled is Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>Judah too! a harvest is appointed for thee,in that I will bring back the captivity of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would have brought healing to Israel, then was disclosed the iniquity of Ephraim, and the wicked doings of Samaria, for they have wrought falsehood,when, a thief, would enter, a band roamed about, outside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>And they say not to their own hearts, that, all their wickedness, I remember, now, have their doings, beset them about, right before my face, have they been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>By their wickedness, they gladden a king, and, by their flatteries,rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They all, are adulterers, like an oven too hot for the baker,who leaveth off stoking, after kneading the dough, till the whole be leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>In the day of our king, the rulers, have made themselves ill, with the heat of wine,he hath extended his hand with scoffers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready, like an oven, their heart, by their lying in wait,all the night, their baker sleepeth, in the morning, he, kindleth up as it were a blazing fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They all, become hot as an oven, and devour their judges,all their kings, have fallen, there hath been none among them crying unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>As for Ephraim! with the peoples, hath he been mingling himself,Ephraim, is a cake not turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Foreigners have, eaten up, his strength, and, he, knoweth it not,even gray hairs, are sprinkled upon him, and, he, knoweth it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>Therefore doth the Excellency of Israel, answer, to his face; yet have they not returned unto Yahweh their God, nor have they sought him, in spite of all this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>So then, Ephraim, hath become, like a simple dove, having no understanding, on Egypt, have they called, to Assyria, have they gone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>Whithersoever they go, I will spread over them my net, like a bird of the heavens, will I bring them down, I will chastise them, by the time the report can reach the flock of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them! for they have taken flight from me, destruction to them! for they have transgressed against me,when, I, would have ransomed them, then, they, spakeconcerning mefalsehoods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>Neither made they outcry unto me, in their heart, although they kept on howling upon their beds, over corn and new wine, they gathered themselves together, they rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>When, I, had warned them, I strengthened their arm,yet, against me, kept they on devising wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They would returnnot to him who is on high! They have become like a deceitful bow, their rulers, shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongue, this,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>To thy mouth, with a horn! Like an eagle, on the house of Yahweh,because they have violated my covenant, and, against my law, have they transgressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>Unto me, shall they make outcry, My God! we acknowledge thee  , Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel hath cast away what is good,an enemy, shall pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They, have appointed kings, but not from me, have made rulers, but I have not acknowledged them: of their silver and their gold, they made themselves idols, to the end they might be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>He hath cast away thy calf, O Samaria, kindled is mine anger upon them,How long shall they not endure to be innocent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For, of Israel, is even that thing! A craftsman, made it, and, a No-god, it is! For, into fragments, shall the Calf of Samaria be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For, to the wind, they sow, and, to the whirlwind, they reap: stalk, hath it none, That which shooteth forth, shall yield no meal, If so be it yield, foreigners, swallow it lip,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Swallowed up, is Israel; Now, have they gone among the nations, like a vessel in which no man taketh, delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For, they, have gone up to Assyria, A wild ass going alone for himself, is Ephraim! They have hired lovers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>Even though they hire them among the nations, at once, will I gather them, when they have begun to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars sinfully, they have become to him the altars of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I have been wont to write for him the myriad things of my law,Like something alien, have they been accounted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>My sacrificial gifts, have they been sacrificing as   flesh, and have eaten, Yahweh, hath not accepted them,Now, will he call to mind their iniquity, that he may punish their sin, they, to Egypt, will return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>And so Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples, and, Judah, hath multiplied fortified cities,Therefore will I send a fire upon his cities, and it shall consume the palaces thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
