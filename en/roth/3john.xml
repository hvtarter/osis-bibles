        <title>Dear children! Guard yourselves from idols.</title>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder, unto Gaius the beloved, whom, I, love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved! concerning all things, I pray thou mayest be prospering, and be in health, even as, thy soul, is prospering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced exceedingly, at brethren coming and bearing witness unto thy truth,even as, thou, in truth, art walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no, greater, favour than these things, that I should be hearing that, my own children, in the truth, are walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved! a faithful thing, art thou doing, whatsoever thou shalt accomplish for them that are brethren, and withal strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have borne witness to thy love before the assembly: whom thou wilt do, nobly, to set forward worthily of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For, in behalf of The Name, have they gone forth, taking, nothing, from them of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We, therefore ought to be sustaining such as these, that we may become, fellowworkers, with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote something unto the assembly; but, he who is fond of taking the first place among themDiotrephes, doth not make us welcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>For this cause, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he is doing,with wicked words, prating against us; and, not content with these, he neither, himself, maketh the brethren welcome, but, them who are minded   .</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved! be not thou imitating what is bad, but what is good. He that doeth good, is, of God: he that doeth what is bad, hath not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Unto Demetrius, hath witness been borne by all and by the truth itself; howbeit, we also, bear witness, and thou knowest that, our witness, is, true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>Many things, had I to write unto thee,but I am unwilling, with ink and pen, to be writing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>I hope, however, straightway, to see thee, and, mouth to mouth, will we talk. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
