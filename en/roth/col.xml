        <title>Who will transfigure our humbled body, into conformity with his glorified body, according to the energy wherewith he is able even to subdue, unto himself, all things.</title>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy my brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>Unto the holy and faithful brethren in Christ that are, in Colosse, favour unto you, and peace, from our God and Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We are giving thanks unto God, the Father of our Lord Jesus  Christ , always, for you, offering prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which ye have unto all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>Because of the hope that is lying by for you in the heavens, of which ye heard before, in the word of the truth of the glad-message,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>When it presented itself unto you; even as, in all the world also, it is bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day when ye heard, and came personally to know the favour of God in truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>Even as ye learned   from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is faithful in our behalf, as a minister of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>Who also hath made evident unto us your love in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this cause, we also, from the day when we heard   , cease not, in your behalf, praying and askingthat ye may be filled unto the personal knowledge of his will, in all spiritual wisdom and discernment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>So as to walk worthily of the Lord, unto all pleasing, in every good work, bearing fruit, and growing in the personal knowledge of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>With all power, being empowered, according to the grasp of his glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>Giving thanks unto the Father that hath made you sufficient for your share in the inheritance of the saints in the light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>Who hath rescued us out of the authority of the darkness, and translated   into the kingdom of the Son of his love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>In whom, we have our redemptionthe remission of our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>Who, is an image of the unseen God, Firstborn of all creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>Because, in him, were created all things in the heavens and upon the earth, the things seen and the things unseen, whether thrones or lordships or principalities or authorities,they all, through him and for him, have been created,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And, he, is before all, and, they all, in him, hold together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And, he, is the head of the body, the assembly, Who is the beginning, Firstborn from among the dead, in order that, he, might become, in all things, himself, pre-eminent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>Because, in him, was all the fullness well pleased to dwell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>And, through him, fully to reconcile all things unto him, making peace through the blood of his cross, through him whether the things upon the earth or the things in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And, you, who at one time were estranged and enemies in your mind in your wicked works, yet, now, hath he fully reconciled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>In his body of flesh, through means of his death, to present you holy and blameless and unaccusable before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>If, at least, ye are abiding still in the faith, founded and firm, and not to be moved away from the hope of the glad-message which ye have heard, which hath been proclaimed in all creation which is under heaven,of which, I Paul, have become minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now, am I rejoicing in the sufferings on your behalf, and am filling up the things that lack of the tribulations of the Christ, in my flesh, in behalf of his body, which is the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>Of which, I, have become ministeraccording to the administration of God which hath been given unto me to you-ward, to fill up the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>The sacred secret which had been hidden away from the ages and from the generations, but, now, hath been made manifest unto his saints</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>Unto whom God hath been pleased to make known what is the glorious wealth of this sacred secret among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of the glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>Whom we are declaring, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, in order that we may present every man complete in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>Unto which I am even toiling, contending according to his energy which is energising itself in me with power.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I desire you to know, how great a contest I am havingin behalf of you, and of those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>In order that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, even unto all the riches of the full assurance of their understanding, unto a personal knowledge of the sacred secret of God,Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>In whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>This I say, in order that, no one, may be reasoning, you, aside with plausible discourse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For, though, indeed, in the flesh, I am absent, yet, in the spirit, with you, I amrejoicing, and beholding your order and the solid firmness of your Christ-ward faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As, therefore, ye have accepted the Anointed Jesus as your Lord, in him, be walking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>Rooted, and being built up, in him, and making yourselves sure in your faith, even as ye have been taught,surpassing therein with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Be taking heed, lest there shall be anyone leading, you, off as a spoil, through means of their philosophy, and an empty deceit,according to the instruction of men, according to the first principles of the world,and not according to Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>Because, in him, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead, bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And ye are, in him, filled full,Who, is the head of all principality and authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>In whom, ye have also been circumcised with a circumcision not done by hand, in the despoiling of the body of flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>Having been buried together with him in your immersion, wherein also ye have been raised together, through your faith in the energising of GodWho raised him from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And, as for youwho were, dead, by your offences and by the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath brought you to life together with him,having in favour forgiven us all our offences,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>Having blotted out the handwriting against us by the decrees, which was hostile to us,and hath taken away, the same, out of the midst, nailing it up to the cross:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>Spoiling the principalities and the authorities, he made of them an open example, celebrating a triumph over them thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no one, therefore, be judging, you,in eating and in drinking, or in respect of feast, or new moon, or sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>Which are a shadow of the things to come, whereas, the body, is of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let, no one, against you, be arbitrating, however wishful,in respect of lowliness of mind, and of a religious observance of the messengers: upon what things he hath seen, taking his stand, in vain, puffed up by his carnal mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>And not holding fast the head: from which, all the body, through means of its joints and uniting bands, receiving supply, and connecting itself together, groweth with the growth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If ye have died, together with Christ, from the first principles of the world, why, as though alive in the world, are ye submitting to decrees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>Which things are all for decay in the using up;according to the commandments and teachings of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>The which things, indeed, though they have, an appearance, of wisdom, in self-devised religious observance, and lowliness of mind,  and  ill-treatment of body, are, in no honourable way, unto a satisfying of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If, therefore, ye have been raised together with the Christ, the things on high, be seeking, where, the Christ, ison the right hand of God, sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>The things on high, hold in esteem, not the things upon the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For ye have died, and, your life, is hid, together with the Christ, in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>As soon as, the Christ, shall be made manifestour life, then, ye also, together with him, shall be made manifest in glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Make dead, therefore, your members that are on the earthas regardeth fornication, impurity, passion, base coveting, and greed, the which, is idolatry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>On account of which things cometh the anger of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>Wherein, ye also, walked, at one time, when ye were living in these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But, now, do, ye also, put them all away,anger, wrath, baseness, defamation, shameful talk out of your mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Be not guilty of falsehood one to another: having stript off the old man, together with his practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>And having put on the newwho is being moulded afresh unto personal knowledge, after the image of him that hath created him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>Wherein there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, bond, free,but, all things and in all, Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on, therefore, as men chosen of God, holy and beloved, tender affections of compassion, graciousness, lowliness of mind, meekness, long-suffering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>Bearing one with another, and in favour forgiving one anotherif any, against any, have a complaint,according as, the Lord, in favour forgave you, so also ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And, over all these things, love, which is a uniting-bond of completeness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let, the peace of Christ, act as umpire in your hearts, unto which ye have been called in  one  body, and be thankful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let, the word of the Christ, dwell within you richly,in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another, with psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, with gratitude, raising song with your hearts unto God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatsoever ye may be doing, in word, or in work, all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Ye wives! be submitting yourselves unto your husbands, as is becoming in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Ye husbands! be loving your wives, and be not embittered against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Ye children! be obedient unto your parents in all things, for, this, is, well pleasing, in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Ye fathers! be not irritating your children, lest they be disheartened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Ye servants! be obedient, in all things, unto them who, according to the flesh, are your masters,not with eye-service, as man-pleasers, but with singleness of heart, revering the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>Whatsoever ye may be doing, from the soul, be working at it, as unto the Lord, and not unto men,-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>Knowing that, from the Lord, ye shall duly receive the recompense of the inheritance,unto the Lord Christ, are ye in service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>For, he that acteth unrighteously, shall get back what he had unrighteously done, and there is no respect of persons;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Ye masters! that which is just and equitable, unto your servants, be rendering, knowing that, ye also, have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Unto prayer, be devoting yourselves, watching therein with thanksgiving:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>Praying, at the same time, for us also,that, God, would open unto us a door for the word, so that we may speak the sacred secret of the Christfor the sake of which also I am in bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>That I may make it manifest as behoveth me to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>In wisdom, be walking towards them who are without,the opportunity, buying out for yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Your discourse being always with benefit, with salt, seasoned,that ye may know how it behoveth you, unto each one, to be making answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All the things which relate unto myself, shall Tychicus make known unto youthe beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>Whom I have sent unto you, to this very end,that ye may get to know the things which concern us, and he may encourage you hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>Together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is from among you:all things, unto you, will they make known, that   here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, saluteth you; and Mark, the first cousin of Barnabas,concerning whom ye have received commandsif he come unto you, give him welcome;</verse>
