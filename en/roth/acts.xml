        <title>but, these, are written, that ye may believe that, Jesus, is, the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye may have life in his name.</title>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The first narrative, indeed, made I, concerning all things, O Theophilus, which Jesus began both to do and teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>Until the day when, having given command unto the apostles, whom through Holy Spirit he had chosen, he was taken up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>Unto whom he also presented himself alive, after he had suffered, by many sure tokens, throughout forty days making himself visible unto them, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And being in company with them he charged them, from Jerusalem, not to absent themselves, butTo abide around the promise of the Father which ye have heard of me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>Because, John, indeed, immersed with water; but, ye, in Holy Spirit shall be immersed,after not many of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>They, therefore, having come together, began to question him, sayingLord! art thou at this time duly establishing the kingdom unto Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He said unto themIt is not yours to get to know times or seasons which the Father hath put in his own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But ye shall receive power when the Holy Spirit cometh upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses, both in Jerusalem and  in  all Judaea and Samaria and as far as the uttermost part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And having said these things, as they were beholding, he was lifted up, and a cloud caught him away from their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And, while they were looking steadfastly into heaven as he was going his way, then lo! two men had taken their stand beside them, in white garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>Who also saidMen of Galilee! why stand ye looking into heaven? This Jesus who hath been taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye yourselves have gazed upon him going into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then returned they into Jerusalem, from a mountain called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem a Sabbath days journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And, when they had entered, into the upper-story went they up, where remained behindboth Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all were giving constant attention with one accord unto the prayer, with  certain  women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And, in these days, Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said,and there was a multitude of names, of one accord, about a hundred and twenty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Brethren! It was needful for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spake beforehand through the mouth of David, concerning Judas,who became guide unto them who apprehended Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For that he had come to be reckoned among us and obtained the lot of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>This man therefore had possessed himself of a field out of the reward of unrighteousness,and falling headlong burst asunder in the midst, and forth gushed all his bowels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it became known unto all them who were dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that field was called, in their language, Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his encampment become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein! Andhis overseership, let a different man take!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is needful then that, of the men who companied with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out over us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>Beginning from the immersion by John until the day when he was taken up from us, that, a witness of his resurrection along with us, should one of these become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they appointed two,Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And, praying, they saidThou Lord! observer of the hearts of all men! shew forth whom thou hast chosen,of these two, one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas went aside, to go his way unto his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And, when the day of pentecost was filling up   they were all together with one intent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>When there came suddenly out of heaven a sound, just as of a mighty rushing wind,-and it filled all the house where they were sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared unto themparting asundertongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each one of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with Holy Spirit, and began to be speaking with other kinds of tongues just as the Spirit was giving unto them to be sounding forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were in Jerusalem sojourning Jews, reverent men from every nation who were under heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And this sound occurring the throng came together and was thrown into confusion, because each one severally heard in his own language them who were speaking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>Yea they were beside themselves and did marvel, sayingLo! are not all these who are speaking Galilaeans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How then do, we, hear each one in our own language in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judaea also and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia also and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of the Libya that is towards Cyrene, and the sojourning Romans,both Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians, we do hear them speaking in our own tongues the magnificent things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>But they were all beside themselves and were utterly at a loss, saying one to anotherWhat doth this please to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>While, others, in mockery were sayingWith sweet wine, are they drunken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But, taking his stand, Peter with the eleven lifted up his voice, and sounded out unto themYe men of Judaea, and all ye who are sojourning in Jerusalem! Let, this, unto you be known, and give ear unto my declarations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For not, as, ye, suppose, are these men drunken, for it is the third hour of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall be, in the last days saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and, your young men, visions shall see and, your elders, in dreams shall dream,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And, even upon my men-servants and upon my maid-servants in those days, will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will set forth wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath,blood and fire and vapour of smoke:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun, shall be turned into darkness and, the moon, into blood,before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and manifest   ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And it shall beWhosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Ye men of Israel! hear these words:Jesus the Nazarene, a man pointed out of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs, which God did through him in your midst, just as ye yourselves know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>The same, by the marked out counsel and foreknowledge of God given up, through the hands of lawless men, suspending, ye slew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>Whom, God, raised up, loosing the pangs of death, inasmuch as it was, not possible, for him to continue held fast by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For, David, saith concerning himI foresaw the Lord before me continually, because he is, on my right hand, that I may not be shaken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>For this reason, was my heart made glad and my tongue exulted,ye further, even my flesh, shall encamp on hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>Because thou wilt not abandon my soul unto hades, neither wilt thou give thy man of lovingkindness to see corruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou madest known unto me paths of life, thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Brethren! it is, allowable, to say with freedom of speech unto you, concerning the patriarch David,that he both died and was buried, and, his tomb, is among us until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Being then, a prophet, and knowing that, with an oath, God had sworn unto him, of the fruit of his loins, to seat on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>With foresight, spake he concerning the resurrection of the Christthat neither was he abandoned unto hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>The same Jesus, hath God raised up, whereof, all we, are witnesses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>By the right hand of God, therefore, having been exalted, also, the promise of the Holy Spirit, having received from the Father, He hath poured out this which, yourselves, do see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For, David, hath not ascended into the heavens; but he saith, himself,Said the Lord unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Assuredly, then, let all the house of Israel know: that, both Lord and Christ, hath God made him, even the same Jesus whom, ye, crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And, when they heard this, they were pricked to the heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostlesWhat are we to do, brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter   unto themRepent ye, and let each one of you be immersed, in the name of Jesus Christ, into the remission of your sins,and ye shall receive the free-gift of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For, unto you, is the promise, and unto your children,and unto all them who are afar off: as many soever as the Lord our God shall call unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And, with many different words, bare he frail witness, and went on exhorting them sayingBe saved from this perverse generation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>They, therefore, who welcomed his word, were immersed; and there were added, on that day, about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they went on to give constant attentionunto the teaching of the apostles, and unto the fellowship, unto the breaking of bread, and unto the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And there came on every soul, fear, and, many wonders and signs, through means of the apostles, were coming to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And, all who believed, with one accord, began to hold all things common;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and, their possessions and goods, were they selling and distributing them unto all, in so far as anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And, daily giving attendance with one intent in the temple and, at home, breaking bread, they were partaking of food with exultation and singleness of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And, the Lord, was adding them who were being saved, daily, together.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now, Peter and John, were going up into the temple, for the hour of prayerthe ninth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And, a certain man, who had been, lame from his mothers womb, was being carried,whom they used to lay daily at the door of the templethe   called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them who were entering into the temple:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple, was requesting to receive, an alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>But Peter looking steadfastly at himwith Johnsaid: Look on us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And, he, gave heed unto them, expecting to receive, something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter saidSilver and gold, have none, but, what I have, the same, unto thee do give:In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, Walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And, laying hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up; and, instantly, were his feet and ankles strengthened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And, leaping forward, he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him, walking and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they began to recognise him, that, the same, was he who, for the alms, used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple;and they were filled with amazement and transport at what had happened unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And, as he held fast Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them, in the portico which is called Solomons,greatly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter, seeing it, made answer unto the people:Ye men of Israel! Why marvel ye at this man? Or, upon us, why are ye intently looking, as though, by our own power or godliness, we had made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,the God of our fathers, hath glorified his servant Jesus:whom, ye, indeed, delivered up and denied to Pilates, face when he had adjudged to release him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But, ye, denied, the Holy and Righteous One, and claimed a man that was a murderer to be granted you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>But, the Princely Leader of Life, ye slew:whom, God, raised from among the dead, whereof, we, are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And, by the faith of his name, unto this man whom ye see and know, hath his name given strength,yea, the faith which is through him, hath given unto him this perfect soundness, over against you all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now brethren, I know that by way of ignorance ye acted,just as even your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>Howbeit, Godwhat things he had before declared, through the mouth of all the prophets, for his Christ to suffer,did thus fulfill!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent ye, therefore, and turn,unto the blotting out of your sins; to the end that in that case, there may come seasons of refreshing from the face of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>And he may send forth him who had been fore-appointed for youChrist Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>Unto whom, indeed, heaven must needs give welcome, until the times of the due establishment of all things, of which God hath spoken through the mouth of his holy age-past prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses, indeed, saidA prophet, unto you, shall the Lord God raise up among your brethren, like unto me: unto him, shall ye hearken respecting all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And it shall beevery soul, whatsoever, which shall not hearken unto that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>But, indeed, all the prophets,from Samuel and those following after, as many as have spoken, have even announced these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>Ye, are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God covenanted unto your fathers, saying unto AbrahamAnd, in thy seed, shall be blessed, all the families of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>Unto you first, Godhaving raised up his Servanthath sent him forth, ready to bless you, when ye are turning away, each one, from your wickednesses.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>But, as they were speaking unto the people, the High-priests and the Captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>Being tired out because of their teaching the people, and announcing, in Jesus, the resurrection from among the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they thrust on them their hands, and put them in custody for the morrow, for it was evening, already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>Howbeit, many of them that heard the word, believed; and the number of the men became about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it came to pass, upon the morrow, that there were gathered together of them, the rulers and the elders and the scribes, in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>Also Annas, the high-priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of high-priestly descent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And, setting them in the midst, they began to enquireIn what manner of power, or in what manner of name, did, ye, do this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with Holy Spirit, said unto themYe rulers of the people, and elders!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>If, we, this day, are to be examined for doing good to a sick man,in whom, this, man hath been made well,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>Be it known unto you all, and unto all the people of Israel: that, in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene,whom, ye, crucified, whom, God, raised from among the dead, in him, doth, this man stand by, in your presence, whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This, is the stone, set at nought by you the builders, which became the head of the corner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And there is in no one else, salvation, for, neither is there any other name, under heaven, which hath been set forth among men, in which we must needs be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>And, looking at Peters boldness of speech, and Johns, and having discovered that they were unlettered and obscure men, they began to marvel, recognising them also, that they had been with Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>Seeing, the man also standing, with them, even the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>Howbeit, ordering them to go forth outside the high-council, they began to confer one with another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>SayingWhat are we to do with these men? For, indeed, that a notable sign hath come to pass through their means, unto all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, is manifest, and we cannot deny   !</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>Nevertheless, lest it further spread abroad among the people, let us charge them with threats, to be no more speaking upon this name, to any soul of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And, calling them, they gave them the sweeping charge,not to be sounding aloud, nor even to be teaching, upon the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But, Peter and John, answering, said unto themWhether it be right in presence of God, unto you, to be hearkening, rather than unto God, judge!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For, we, cannot but be speaking the things which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>They, however, further charging them with threats, let them go, finding nothing as to how they might chastise them, on account of the people; because, all, were glorifying God for that which had come to pass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For, more than forty years old, was the man, upon whom had taken place, this healing sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>But, when they had been let go, they came unto their own   , and told as many things as, unto them, the High-priests and Elders, had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And, they, having heard, with one accord, uplifted voice unto God, and saidO Sovereign! Thou, art he that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are herein:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>Who, by our father, through means of the Holy Spirit, even by the mouth of David thy servant, saidUnto what end did nations rage, and, peoples, busy themselves with empty things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth stationed themselves, and, the rulers, were gathered together, with one intent, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For they were gathered together, of a truth, in this city, against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed,both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with them of the nations, and peoples of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>To do whatsoever, thy hand and thy counsel, marked out beforehand to come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>As to the present things, then, O Lord,look upon their threats, and grant unto thy servants, with all freedom of utterance, to be speaking thy word,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the Apostles, answering, saidIt is needful to be yielding obedience unto God rather than unto men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers, hath raised up Jesus,whom, ye, got into your hands, suspending him upon a tree:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a certain man, rising up in the high-council, by name Gamaliel, a law-teacher honoured by all the people, gave orders to put the men, outside, for a little,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For, before these days, there rose up one Theudas, affirming, himself, to be somebody,unto whom was inclined a number of men, about four hundred; who was slain, and, all as many as had been trusting in him, were disbanded, and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After him, rose up Judas the Galilaean, in the days of the enrolling, and drew a people into revolt after him; and, he, perished, and, all, as many as had trusted in him, were scattered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>They, therefore, having fully borne witness, and spoken the word of the Lord, began their return unto Jerusalem, and, unto many villages of the Samaritans, were they telling the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>And, a messenger of the Lord, spake unto Philip, sayingArise, and be journeying along southward, unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,the same, is desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>And, arising, he journeyed. And lo! a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, one in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure  who  had come to worship in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>And was returning, and, sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>And the Spirit said unto PhilipGo near, and join thyself unto this chariot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>And, running near, Philip heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and saidDost thou, then, understand what thou art reading?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>And, he, saidHow indeed should be ableunless someone shall guide me? And he called upon Philip, to come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>Now, the passage of Scripture which he was reading, was, this:As a sheep, unto slaughter, was he led, and, as a lamb, before him that sheareth it, is dumb, so, he openeth not his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away,his generation, who shall describe? because, his life, is taken away from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>And the eunuch, making answer unto Philip, saidI pray thee! Of whom, is the prophet saying this? of himself, or, of some different person?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>And Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, told him the glad tidings of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And, as they were journeying along the way, they came unto a certain water,and the eunuch saithLo! water! What doth hinder my being immersed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down, both, into the water, both Philip and the eunuch,and he immersed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>But, when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more; for he was going on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>Now Philip was found at Azotus; and, passing through, he was telling the glad tidings unto all the cities, until he came unto Caesarea.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>and on the day of rest, we went forth outside the gate, beside a river, where we supposed there was a place of prayer,and, sitting down, we went on to speak unto the women who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And, a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, devout towards God, was hearkening, whose heart, the Lord, fully opened, to be giving heed unto the things being spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And, when she was immersed, and her house, she besought</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>And are declaring customs, which it is not allowable for us either to accept or to observe, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them, and, the magistrates, rending off them their mantles, were giving orders to beat them with rods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>and, laying upon them many stripes, they thrust them into prison, charging the prison-keeper, safely, to be keeping them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And. when day came. the magistrates sent off the constables sayingLet those men go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the prison-keeper reported the words unto PaulThe magistrates have sent, that ye be let go. Now, therefore, going forth, be taking your journey in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But, Paul, said unto themBeating us, in public, uncondemned, men that are Romans, they thrust us into prison;and, now, by stealth, are they thrusting us forth? Nay, verily! but let them come, themselves, and lead us out!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And, travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>and, according to Pauls custom, he went in unto them, and, for three sabbaths, reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>opening up, and setting forth, that it was needful for, the Christ, to suffer, and to arise from among the dead; and   , This, is the Christ,Jesus, whom, I, am declaring unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And, some from among them, were persuaded, and cast in their lot with Paul and Silas; also, of the devout Greeks, a great throng, and, of the chief women, not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews, being, jealous, and taking unto themselves certain wicked men, of the rabble, and making a riot, were setting the city in an uproar; and, besieging the house of Jason, were seeking to lead them forth unto the populace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>and, not finding them, they began dragging Jason and certain brethren unto the city-rulers, shoutingThey who have thrown the inhabited earth into confusion, the same, hither also, are come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>unto whom Jason hath given welcome; and, these all, contrary to the decrees of Caesar, are acting,saying that there is another king, Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>and, taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>But, the brethren, straightway, during the night, sent away both Paul and Silas unto Beroea, who, indeed, arriving, unto the synagogue of the Jews, went off;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>and, these, were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they welcomed the word with all readiness of mind, daily, searching the Scriptures,whether these things could be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Many, therefore, from among them, believed, and, of the Grecian women of the higher class, and of men, not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But, when the Jews from Thessalonica came to know that, in Beroea also, had the word of God been declared by Paul, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Howbeit, then, immediately, the brethren sent away, Paul, to be journeying as far as unto the sea; and both Silas and Timothy stayed behind, there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>But, they who were conducting Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and, receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy, that with, all possible speed, they would come unto him, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But, while, in Athens, Paul was expecting them, his spirit within him was being urged on, seeing how the city was given to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So then, he began reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them who worshipped; and, in the market-place, every day, with them who happened to be at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>But, certain both of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were encountering him; and some were sayingWhat might this picker-up-of-scraps wish to be saying? And, othersOf foreign demons, he seemeth to be a declarer: because, of Jesus and the Resurrection, he was announcing the joyful tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And so, laying hold of him, they brought him up, to the Hill of Mars, sayingCan we get to know what this new teaching is, which, by thee, is being spoken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they might be seeking Godif, after all, indeed, they might feel after him and find him,although, in truth, he is already not far from any one of us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>The times of ignorance, therefore, overlooking, God, as things now are, is charging all men everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>inasmuch as he hath appointed a day, in which he is about to be judging the habitable earth in righteousness, by a man whom he hath pointed out,offering faith unto all, by raising him from among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>Now, when they heard of raising the dead, some, indeed, began to mock, while, others, saidWe will hear thee, concerning this, even again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>Thus, Paul, came forth out of their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But, certain persons, joining themselves unto him, believed; among whom were even Dionysius the Mars-hill judge, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>When, however, both Silas and Timothy had come down from Macedonia, Paul began to be urged on in the word, bearing full witness unto the Jews that, Jesus, was, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But, as they began opposing and defaming, shaking out his garments, he said unto themYour blood, be upon your own head! Pure, am, I: henceforth, unto the nations, will I go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>Now, hearing this, and becoming full of wrath, they began crying aloud, sayingGreat, is Diana of the Ephesians!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>But, after the tumult had ceased, Paul, sending for the disciples and exhorting them, took leave, and went forth to be journeying unto Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>Passing through those parts, however, and exhorting them with much discourse, he came into Greece;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and, spending three months, when a plot was laid against him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria, he determined to turn back through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>Now there were accompanying him, Sopater, son of Pyrrhus a Beroean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; and, of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>And, these, came and were waiting for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And, we, sailed forth, after the days of unleavened bread, from Philippi, and came unto them in Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And, on the first of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul went on to discourse with them, being about to depart on the morrow; and he prolonged his discourse until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>Now there were a good many torches in the upper room, where we were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And there sat, a certain young man by name Eutychus, in the window, who was getting overpowered by a deep sleep; and, while Paul was discoursing yet further, being overpowered by his sleep, he fell, from the third story, down, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Going down, however, Paul fell upon him, and, embracing him, saidBe not making confusion; for, his soul, is, in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And, going up, and breaking the loaf, and tasting,for a good while also conversing, until dawn, thus, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the boy alive, and were comforted beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>And, we, going forward unto the ship, set sail for Assos, from thence being about to take up Paul; for, so, had he arranged, being about, himself, to go on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And, when he fell in with us in Assos, we took him on board, and came into Mitylene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>and, from thence sailing away on the morrow, we came over against Chios, and, on the next day, we thrust aside into Samos, and, on the succeeding day, we came into Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, lest he should happen to lose time in Asia; for he hastened, if it were possible for him, against the day of Pentecost, to arrive, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>But, from Miletus, he sent unto Ephesus, and called for the elders of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And, when they were come to him, he said unto themYe yourselves, well know, from the first day when I set foot in Asia, in what manner came to be with you all the time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>doing service unto the Lord, with all humility and tears, and temptations which befell me through the plots of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>in what manner I in nowise shrank from announcing unto you anything that was profitable and teaching you publicly and in your homes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>bearing full witness, both to Jews and to Greeks, as to the repentance due unto God, and as to belief on our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And, now, lo! I, bound in my spirit, am journeying unto Jerusalem; the things which therein shall befall me, not knowing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>save that, the Holy Spirit, from city to city, doth bear me full witness, saying that, bonds and tribulations, await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But, for no cause whatever, am I making my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full witness as to the good news of the favour of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And, now, lo! I, know that, no more, shall ye see my face,ye all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Wherefore I take you to witness, on this very day, that, pure am I from the blood of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>for I have not shrunk from announcing all the counsel of God unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Be taking heed unto yourselves, and unto all the little flock in which the Holy Spirit hath set, you, as overseers,to be shepherding the assembly of God which he hath acquired through means of the blood of his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I, know, that there will enter, after my departure, grievous wolves into your midst, not sparing the little flock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>and, from among your own selves, will arise men speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Wherefore, be on the watch, remembering that, for three years, night and day, I gave myself no rest, with tears, admonishing each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>Now, therefore, I commend you unto the Lord, and unto his word of favour,which is able to build up and give the inheritance among all the hallowed ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>The silver or gold or apparel of no one, did I covet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>yourselves, acknowledge that, for my necessities and for those who were with me, hard wrought these hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>In all things, I gave you to understand, that, thus toiling, it behoves to be helping the weak, also to be keeping in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, that, he himself, saidHappy is it, rather to give than to receive!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And, these things saying, kneeling down with them all, he prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And they all wept much, and, falling upon Pauls neck, they were tenderly kissing him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>being most distressed for the word which he had said,That, no more, should they, his face, behold. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And it came to pass, when we set sail, having torn ourselves from them, running a straight course, we came unto Cos, and, on the next day, unto Rhodes,and from thence unto Patara;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>and, finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, going on board, we set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>And, sighting Cyprus, and leaving it behind to the left, we held on our voyage to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for, there, the ship was to discharge her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And, finding up the disciples, we remained there seven days, and they, unto Paul, began to say, through the Spirit, that he would gain no footing in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>And, when it came to pass that we had completed the days, we went forth, and continued our journey, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, as far as outside the city; and, kneeling down on the beach in prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>we tare ourselves from each other, and we went on board the ship, while, they, returned unto their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And, we, finishing the voyage from Tyre, reached Ptolemais, and, saluting the brethren, abode one day with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>and, on the morrow departing, we came to Caesarea, and, entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Nowthis man, had four virgin daughters, who used to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And, as we stayed on many days, there came down a certain man from Judaea, a prophet, by name Agabus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>and, coming unto us, and taking Pauls girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and saidThus, saith the Holy Spirit, the man whose this girdle is, shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver up into the hands of Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And, when we heard these things, both, we, and they of the place began beseeching him, not to go up unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then, answered PaulWhat are ye doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For, I, not only to be bound, but to die in Jerusalem, am ready, in behalf of the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And, as he was not to be persuaded, we ceased, sayingthe Lords, will be done!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And, after these days, making ready what we had, we started to go up unto Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>and there went certain also of the disciples from Caesarea, along with us, who were to introduce us unto one with whom we might be entertained, one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>Now, when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren, gladly welcomed us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And, on the next day, Paul went in with us unto James, and, all the elders, were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And, saluting them, he went on to narrate, one by one, each of the things which God had wrought among the nations through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And, they, having heard, began glorifying God; and they said to himThou observest, brother, how many myriads there are among the Jews who have believed, and, all, are zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>Now they have heard it rumoured concerning thee, that, an apostacy, art thou teaching, from Moses, unto all the Jews, who are among the nations, telling them not to be circumcising their children, nor, by the customs, to be walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What, then, is it? at all events, they will hear that thou hast come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>This, then, do, which unto thee, we say:We have four men who have a vow upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Taking these unto thee, be purified with them, and spend something upon them, that they may shave their head; and all will get to know, that the things which they have heard rumoured concerning thee, are, nothing,on the contrary, thou thyself, dost keep the ranks, guarding the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But, concerning them of the nations who have believed, we ourselves, sent, deciding that they should be guarding themselves, both as to idol sacrifice, and blood, and what is strangled, and fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul, taking unto him the men, on the next day, with them, being purified, began entering into the temple to declare the filling up of the days of the purificationuntil, the offering, had been presented for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>When, however, the seven days were on the point of being concluded, the Jews from Asia, observing him in the temple, began to urge-on all the multitude, and thrust upon them their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying outIsraelites! be giving help! This, is the man who, against the people, and the law, and this place, is teaching, all men everywhere; furthermore, even Greeks, hath he brought into the temple, and hath profaned this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had before seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city along with him, whom they were supposing, Paul, had brought, into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was set in motion, and there took place a running together of the people, and, laying hold of Paul, they proceeded to drag him outside the temple, and, straightway, the doors were made fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>When, also, they were seeking to slay him, there was carried up information, unto the captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who, instantly taking unto him soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them; and, they, seeing the captain and the soldiers, left off striking Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then, the captain, drawing near, laid hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains,and began to enquire, who he might be, and what he had done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>but, others, were calling out, something else, in the multitude; and so, as he could not get to know the certainty, because of the tumult, he ordered him to be brought into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And, when he came unto the stairs, so it was that he was borne along by the soldiers, because of the force of the multitude;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the throng of the people was following, crying outAway with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>But, when he was on the point of being taken into the castle, Paul saith unto the captainIs it allowed me, to say somewhat unto thee? And he saidWith Greek, art thou acquainted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Not, then, art, thou, the Egyptian, who, before these days, stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four-thousand men of the Assassins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>And Paul saidI, indeed, am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia,a citizen, of no obscure city; but I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And, when he had given leave, Paul, standing upon the stairs, waved with his hand unto the people; and, when great silence was secured, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Brethren and fathers! Hear ye, the defence, which I now make unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And, when they heard that, in the Hebrew language, he had begun to address them, they kept the more quiet. And he saith</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I, am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but nurtured in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel,trained after the strictness of our ancestral law; being jealous for God just as, all ye, are this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>and, this way, I persecuted unto the death, binding and delivering up into prisons both men and women:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as, even the High-priest, beareth me witness, and all the Eldership,from whom, letters also, accepting to the brethren, unto Damascus, was I journeying, to bring them who were there bound unto Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>But it befell me, as I was journeying and drawing nigh unto Damascus, that, about mid-daysuddenlyout of heaven, there flashed a great light all around me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell also to the ground, and heard a voice saying unto meSaul! Saul! Why, me, art thou persecuting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And, I, answeredWho art thou, Lord? And he said unto meI, am Jesus the Nazarene, whom, thou, art persecuting!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>Now, they who were with me, beheld, indeed, the light, but heard not, the voice, of him that was speaking with me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And saidWhat shall I do, Lord? And, the Lord, said unto meArise, and be going thy way into Damascus, and, there, shall it be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>But, as I could not see clearly owing to the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them who were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And, one Ananias, a man devout according to the law, well-attested by all the Jews that dwelt there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>coming unto me, and standing over me, saidSaul, brother! look up. And, I, in that very hour, looked up on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he saidThe God of our fathers, hath chosen thee to get to know his will, and to see the Righteous One,and to hear a voice out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>Because thou shalt be a witness to him unto all men, of the things which thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And, now, what art thou going to do? Arise, and get thyself immersed, and have thy sins bathed away, calling upon his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it came to pass, when had returned unto Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I came to be in a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw him, saying unto meHaste thee, and go forth speedily out of Jerusalem, inasmuch as they will not accept thy witness concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And, I, saidLord! they themselves, well know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue them who were believing on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And, when the blood of Stephen thy witness was being shed, even I myself, was standing by, and approving, and guarding the mantles of them who were slaying him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said unto me-Be taking thy journey; because, I, unto nations afar off, will send thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they hearkened unto him as far as this word, and lifted up their voice, sayingAway from the earth, with such a man as this, for it is not fit that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>Now, as they were both making an outcry and tearing their mantles,dust, also were throwing into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the captain ordered him to be brought into the castle, saying, that, with scourging, he should be put to the test,that he might find out, for what cause they were, thus, clamouring against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But, when they had stretched him out with straps, Paul said unto the by-standing centurionA Roman, and uncondemned, is it allowed you to be scourging?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And, when the centurion heard   , he went unto the captain, and reported, sayingWhat art thou going to do? For, this man, is, a Roman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the captain, coming up, said to himTell me! Art, thou, a, Roman? And, he, saidYea!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the captain answeredI, for a large sum, this citizenship acquired! And, Paul, saidBut, I, am even,   born!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Straightway, therefore, they who were about to put him to the test, withdrew from him; and, even the captain, was struck with fear, when he found out he was, a Roman, and because, him, he had bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>But, on the morrow, being minded to get to know the certainty as to why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him, and ordered the High-priests and all the High-council to come together; and, bringing down Paul, set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul, looking steadfastly, at the High-council, saidBrethren! I, in all good conscience have used my citizenship for God until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And, the High-priest, Ananias, ordered them that stood by him, to be smiting him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then, Paul, unto him, saidGod is about to be smiting thee, thou whited wall! Dost, thou, then sit to judge me according to the law, and, unlawfully, orderest me to be smitten?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And, they who stood by, saidThe High-priest of God, dost thou revile?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>And Paul saidI was not aware, brethren, that he was high-priest; because it is writtenOf a ruler of thy people, shalt thou not speak injuriously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But Paul, getting to know that, the one part, were Sadducees and, the other, Pharisees, began to cry aloud in the councilBrethren! I, am, a Pharisee, son of Pharisees:Concerning a hope, even of a rising again of the dead, am I to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And, as this he was saying, there arose a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees; and rent asunder was the throng.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For, Sadducees, say, there is no rising again, nor messenger, nor spirit, whereas, Pharisees, confess them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there arose a great outcry, and certain of the Scribes of the party of the Pharisees, standing up, began to strive, sayingNothing bad, find we in this man;but, if a spirit hath spoken unto him, or a messenger</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And, great dissension arising, the captain, fearing lest Paul would be torn in pieces by them, ordered the troop to go down, and take him by force out of their midst, to bring him into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>But, on the following night, the Lord, standing over him, saidBe of good courage! for, as thou hast fully borne witness of the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so must thou, in Rome also, bear witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And, when it became day, the Jews, forming a conspiracy, bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had slain Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were, more than forty, who, this sworn-confederacy, had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they went unto the High-priests and Elders, and saidWith a curse have we bound ourselves, to taste, nothing, until we have slain Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now, therefore, do, ye, with the High-council, make it appear unto the captain, that he should bring him down unto you, as though about to ascertain more exactly the things that concern him; and, we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Pauls sisters son hearing of the lying-in-wait, happening to be near, and coming into the castle,reported it unto Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul, calling unto him one of the centurions, saidThis young man, lead thou away unto the captain, for he hath somewhat to report unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>He, therefore, taking him with him, brought him unto the captain, and saithThe prisoner Paul, calling me unto him, requested me to bring this young man unto thee, as having somewhat to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the captain, taking him by the hand, and going aside, began, privately, to askWhat is it which thou hast to report unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he saidThe Jews, have agreed to request thee, that, to-morrow, thou wouldst bring, Paul, down into the High-council, as though about to ascertain something, more exact, concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Thou, therefore, do not be persuaded by them, for there are lying in wait for him, from among them, more than forty men,who, indeed, have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor drink, till they have killed him; and, now, are they ready, awaiting the promise, from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>the captain, therefore, dismissed the young man, charging himUnto no one, divulge thou, that, these things, thou hast shewed unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And calling certain two of the centurions he saidMake ye ready two hundred soldiers, that they may journey as far as Caesarea,and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>beasts also provide, in order that, seating Paul thereon, they may bring him safely through unto Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter, after this form:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias, unto the most excellent governor Felix, Joy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man, having been apprehended by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, I went down with the troop, and rescued; having learned that he was, a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And, being minded to find out the cause for which they were accusing him,  I took him down into their High-council ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but, of nothing worthy of death or bonds, to be charged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>But, when I was informed there would be a plot against the man, forthwith, I sent him unto thee, charging, his accusers also, to be speaking against him before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers, according to their orders, taking up Paul, brought him by night unto Antipatris;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>and the others, entering into Caesarea, and delivering the letter unto the governor, set, Paul also, before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And, when he had read it, and asked out of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And Paul answered, when the governor had motioned him to be speaking,Well knowing thee to have been, for many years, judge unto his nation, cheerfully, as to the things concerning myself, do I make defence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>seeing thou art able to ascertain, that there are, not more, than twelve days, since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And, as he was reasoning of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix, becoming greatly afraid, answeredFor the present, be going thy way, and, when I find an opportunity, I will send for thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>at the same time, also hoping that, money, would be given him by Paul; wherefore also, the more frequently sending for him, he used to converse with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus, therefore, having come upon the province, after three days, went up unto Jerusalem from Caesarea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>and the High-priest and chiefs of the Jews laid information before him against Paul, and began to beseech him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking for themselves as a favour against him, that he would send for him unto Jerusalem,making, an ambush, to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus, therefore, answered, that Paul should be kept in Caesarea, and that, he himself, was about, shortly, to be going out   .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>They, therefore, among you (saith he) who are in power, let them go down with me; and, if there is in the man, anything amiss, let them accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And, spending among them, not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and, on the morrow, taking his place upon the judgment-seat, ordered Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And, when he presented himself, the Jews who, from Jerusalem, had come down, stood round about him, many and grievous charges, bringing against   , which they were not able to prove,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But, Festus, wishing, with the Jews, to gain, favour, answered Paul, and saidArt thou willing, unto Jerusalem, to go up, and, there, concerning these things, be judged before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul saidStanding before the judgment-seat of Caesar, am I, where, I, ought to be judged. Unto the Jews, have I done no wrong, as, even thou, right well, art discovering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If then, on the one hand, I am doing wrong, and, anything worthy of death, have committed, I excuse not myself from dying; but, on the other hand, if there is, nothing, in the things whereof these are accusing me, no man, hath power to give, me, unto them as a favour:Unto Caesar, I appeal!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And, some days having gone by, Agrippa the king and Bernice came down to Caesarea, to salute Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And, as they were spending more days there, Festus, repeated, unto the king, the things relating to Paul, sayingA certain man, hath been left behind by Felix, as a prisoner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>concerning whom, when I happened to be in Jerusalem, the High-priests and the Elders of the Jews laid information, claiming against him a condemnation:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When, therefore, they had come together here, no delay whatever, making, on the next day, taking my place upon the judgment-seat, I ordered the man to be brought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Concerning whom, taking their stand, his accusers, no accusation at all, were bringing, of the evil things which, I, had been suspecting;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And, I, being at a loss as to the inquiry into these things, was askingwhether he might be minded to go unto Jerusalem, and, there, be judged concerning these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But, Paul, having appealed to be kept for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept, until I could send him up unto Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And, Agrippa,   unto FestusI could wish, myself also, to hear, the man. To-morrow, (saith he) thou shalt hear him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus saithKing Agrippa! and all ye men, here present with us: Ye observe this person, concerning whom, one and all the throng of the Jews, have interceded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying aloud that he ought not to be living any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But, I, gathered, that, nothing worthy of death, had he committed; and, this man himself, having appealed unto the Emperor, I decided to send him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Concerning whom, anything certain to write unto my lord, I have not; wherefore, I have brought him forth before you,and especially before thee, King Agrippa! in order that, after examination had, I might have something I could write;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I, therefore, imagined to myself, that, against the name of Jesus the Nazarene, it was needful, many hostile things, to bring about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which also I did in Jerusalem, yea and, many of the saints, I myself, in prisons, shut up,the authority, from the High-priests, having received: and, when they were to be put to death, I brought against them my vote;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>and, throughout all the synagogues, ofttimes punishing them, I would fain have compelled them to defame; and, being excessively maddened against them, I went on to pursue them as far as even the outlying cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>Among which things, being on a journey unto Damascus, with the authority and commission of the High-priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at midday, on the road, I saw, O King, from heaven, above the splendour of the sun, shining around me, a light, and   them who, with me, were journeying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>and, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice, saying unto me, in the Hebrew languageSaul! Saul! why, me, art thou persecuting? It is hard for thee, against goads, to be kicking!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And, I, saidWho art thou, Lord? And the Lord saidI, am Jesus, whom, thou, art persecuting!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But rise and stand upon thy feet; for, to this end, have I appeared unto thee,To appoint thee an attendant and a witness, both of the things as to which thou hast seen me, and of those as to which I will appear unto thee:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>Butboth to them in Damascus, first, and in Jerusalem, unto all the country of Judaea also, and unto the nations, I carried tidingsthat they should repent, and turn unto God, and, works worthy of their repentance, should practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>Because of these things, Jews seized me in the temple, and were attempting to slay me with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>So then, having met with, the help that is from God, until this day, do I stand, witnessing to both small and great, nothing else saying, than those things which both the prophets, and Moses, did say should certainly come to pass:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And, when day came, they could not recognise, the land; but perceived, a certain bay, having a beach,upon which they were minded, if they could, safely to bring the ship.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But, falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and, the foreship sticking fast, remained immoveable, while, the stern, began to break up, from the violence   .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>Now, the soldiers counsel, turned out to be, that they should kill, the prisoners, lest any one should swim out and escape;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>but, the centurion, being minded to bring Paul safely through, hindered them of their purpose, and ordered such as were able to swim, to cast themselves overboard and, get first to the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and, the rest, some, on planks, and, some, on other things from the ship, and, so, it came to pass, that, all, were brought safely through, on to the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And, when we were safely through, then, we knew that the island was called, Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And, the natives, began to shew us no common philanthropy; for, kindling a fire, they received us all, because of the rain that had set in, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>But, when Paul had gathered a certain lot of firewood into a bundle, and laid it on the fire, a viper, by reason of the heat, coming forth, fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And, when the natives saw the brute hanging out from his hand, they began to say, one to anotherDoubtless, this man is, a murderer, whom, though brought safely through out of the sea, Justice, hath not suffered, to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>He, however, shaking of the brute into the fire, suffered no harm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>whereas, they, were expecting, that he was about to become inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead;but, when they had been long expecting, and had observed, nothing unusual, happening unto him, they changed their minds, and began to say he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now, in the neighbourhood of that place, were lands, belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius,who, making us welcome, for three days, hospitably entertained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it so happened that, the father of Publius, with feverish heats and dysentery distressed, was lying prostrate: unto whom Paul entering in and praying, laid his hands on him, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And, when this happened, the rest also, even they in the island who were sick, were coming in and getting cured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also, with many honours, honoured us, and, when we were about to sail, put on board such things as we might need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And, after three months, we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island,   of Alexandria, whose ensign was The Twin Brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>and, touching at Syracuse, we tarried three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>whence, going round, we reached Rhegium; and, after one day, a south wind springing up, on the second day, we came to Puteoli;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where, finding brethren, we were entreated to tarry, with them, seven days;and, thus, towards Rome, we came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And, when from thence the brethren heard the tidings concerning us, they came to meet us, as far as The Market of Appius and the Three Tavernsseeing whom, Paul thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And, when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass, after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and, when they came together, he began to say unto themI, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, as a prisoner, out of Jerusalem, was delivered into the hands of the Romans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, indeed, when they had examined me, were minded to set me at liberty, because there was, nothing worthy of death, in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But, as the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar,not as though, against my nation, I had anything to bring by way of accusation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this cause, therefore, have I called for you, to see and to speak with you; for, on account of the hope of Israel, this chain, have I about me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And, they, said unto himWe, have neither received letters concerning thee from the Jews, nor hath anyone of the brethren who hath arrived reported or spoken concerning thee, anything ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we deem it well, that, from thee, we should hear what are thine opinions; for, indeed, concerning this sect, it is, known to us, that, everywhere, is it spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And, having arranged with him a day, there came unto him, to the lodging, a larger number; unto whom he proceeded to expound, bearing full witness as to the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets,from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And, some, indeed, were persuaded by the things that were spoken, whereas, others, disbelieved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>and, not being, agreed, among themselves, they began to leave,Paul having said one thingWell, did, the Holy Spirit, speak through Isaiah the prophet, unto your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>sayingGo thy way unto this people, and sayYe shall, surely hear, and yet will in nowise understand. And, surely see, and yet will in nowise perceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people, hath become dense, and, with their ears, heavily, have they heard, and, their eyes, have they closed,lest once they should see with their eyes, and, with their ears, should hear, and, with their hearts, should understand, and return,when I would certainly heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it, known unto you, therefore, that, unto the nations, hath been sent forth this salvation of God: they, will also hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>fehlt</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And he abode two whole years in his own hired house, and made welcome all who were coming in unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, without hindrance.</verse>
