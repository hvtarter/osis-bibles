      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <title>The wolf and the lamb, shall feed, in unity, And, the lion, as an ox, shall eat straw; But as for the serpent, dust, shall be his food: They shall not harmNor shall they destroy, In all my holy mountain, saith Yahweh.</title>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah,of the priests who were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>unto whom came the word of Yahweh, in the days of Josiah son of Amen king of Judah,in the thirteenth year of his reign;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>it came also in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah,as far as the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>So then, the word of Yahweh came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I formed thee at thy birth, I took knowledge of thee, And before thy nativity, I hallowed thee,A prophet to the nations, I appointed thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then said IAh! My Lord Yahweh! Lo! I know not how to speak,For a child, am I!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>Then said Yahweh unto me, Do not say, A child, am, I,For against whomsoever I send thee, shalt thou go, And whatsoever I command thee, shalt thou speak:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid of their faces, For with thee, am I, to deliver thee Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and touched my mouth,and Yahweh said unto me, Lo! I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See! I have set thee in charge this day, over the nations and over the kingdoms, To uproot and to break down, and to destroy and to tear in pieces,To build and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the Word of Yahweh came unto me saying, What canst thou see Jeremiah? And I said, A twig of an almond-tree, can I see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then said Yahweh unto meThou hast rightly seen,for keeping watch, am I over my word to perform it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of Yahweh came unto me a second time saying, What canst thou see? And I said, A boiling caldron, Can I see, with, the front thereof lion the North.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then said Yahweh unto me,Out of the North, shall break forth calamity, against all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For behold me! calling for all the families of the kingdoms of the North, Declareth Yahweh,and they shall come, and set every one his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem and against all her walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>Then will I pronounce my judgments against them, concerning all their wickedness,in that they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods, and have bowed down to the works of their own hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>Thou, therefore, shalt gird thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them, all that, I, command thee,be not dismayed because of them, lest I dismay thee before their face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>I, thereforelo! I have set thee to-day as a fortified city, and as a pillar of iron and as walls of bronze, over all the land,against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests and against the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>And they will fight against thee but shall not prevail against thee,for with thee, am I, Declareth Yahweh, to deliver thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>And the word of Yahweh came unto me, saying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem sayingThus saith Yahweh, I remember in thy behalf, the lovingkindness of thy youthful days, The love of thy bridal estate,Thy coming out after me, Through the desert, Through a land, not sown:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Holiness, was Israel unto Yahweh, The first-fruit of his increase,All that devoured it, were held guilty, Calamity used to come upon them,Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear ye the word of Yahweh O house of Jacob, And all the families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus, saith Yahweh,What did your fathers find in me by way of perversity, that they removed far from me,and went after vanity, and became vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>Neither said they, Where is Yahweh, Who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,Who led us Through the desert, Through a land of wastes and clefts, Through a land of parched places and of death-shade, Through a land, Along which no man had passed, And in which no son of earth dwelt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>Then brought I you into a country of garden land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof,and yet when ye entered, then defiled ye my land, and mine inheritance, ye made an abomination</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests, said not Where is Yahweh? And, they who handled the law, did not acknowledge me, And the shepherds transgressed against me,And the prophets, prophesied by Baal, And so after things that could not profit, did they walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>Therefore yet further will I plead with you Declareth Yahweh, Yea with your childrens children, will I plead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>Forpass through the coastlands of the West and see, And unto Kedar, send ye and consider diligently,And seewhether there hath been the like of this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Hath a nation, changed gods, although they were No-gods? Yet my people have changed my glory for that which could not profit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be amazed, O ye heavens, at this,And shudder, be dried up utterly, Urgeth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>For two wicked things, have my people committed,Me, have they forsaken a fountain of living water, To hew out for themselves cisterns broken cisterns, that cannot hold water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>Was Israel a servant? Born in the house, was he? Wherefore hath he become a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>Against him, have been roaring wild lions, They have uttered their voice,and have made his land a desolation, His cities, have been burned, so as to have no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Even the sons of Noph and Tahpanhes have been crushing the crown of the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Is not this what thou wast certain to do for thyself,in that thou didst forsake Yahweh thy God, when he was leading thee by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>Now, therefore what hast thou to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Let thy wickedness correct thee And thine apostasies, rebuke thee, Know therefore and see That it is a wicked thing and a bitter, that thou shouldest have forsaken Yahweh thy God, And that the dread of me should not have pertained to thee, Declareth My Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>For, in age-past time, I brake thy yoke, I tare off thy fetters, And thou saidst, I will not transgress,Nevertheless, on every high hill, and under every green tree, wast thou lying down as an unchaste woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet, I, planted thee a precious vine, a wholly true seed,How then didst thou change thyself towards me, into the degenerate plantings of the alien vine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>For though thou wash thee with nitre, And take thee much soap, Yet is thine iniquity inscribed before me Declareth My Lord Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How canst thou say, I have not defiled myself, After the Baalim, have I not gone? See thy way, in the valley, Own what thou hast done,A nimble young she-camel, crossing her own ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>A wild ass, taught of the desert, In the desire of her soul, she snuffeth the wind, In her occasion, who can turn her back? None who seek her, will weary themselves, In her month, they shall find her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from thirst! But thou saidst Hopeless! No! for I love foreigners and after them, will I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>As the shame of a thief when he is found, So, hath been put to shame, the house of Israel,They, their kings their princes, and their priests and their prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>Saying, to a tree, My father, art thou! And to a stone, Thou, didst give us birth, For they have turned unto me the back and not the face,But in the time of their calamity, they will say, Arise, and save us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>Where then are thy gods which thou hast made for thyself? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy calamity,For according to the number of thy cities, have become thy gods O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>Wherefore, should ye plead against me, All of you, have transgressed against me Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain, have I smitten your children, Correction, have they not accepted,Your sword hath devoured your prophets, as a lion that destroyeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>O generation see, ye, the word of Yahweh, A desert, became I unto Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore, have my people said, We have roved about, We will not come in any more unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can, a virgin, forget, her ornaments,A bride, her girdle? Yet, my people, have forgotten me, days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>How thou dost make winsome thy way, to seek love! Therefore, even unto wicked women, hast thou taught thy ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Even in thy skirts, is there found, The blood of the lives of the helpless innocents,Not in the act of breaking in, didst thou find them, yet   on all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>Although thou saidst, Because I am innocent, surely hath his anger turned back from me,Behold me! entering into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>How vigorously, thou goest about changing thy way! Even of Egypt, shalt thou be ashamed, just as thou wast ashamed of Assyria:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>Even from this one, shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head,For Yahweh hath rejected those in whom thou confidest, and thou shalt not prosper with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>He hath said, If a man send away his wife, and she go from him and become another mans, will he return unto her, again? would not that land be, utterly defiled? And, thou, hast been unchaste with many neighbours, and yet   to return unto me! Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights and seewhere thou hast not been unchastely embraced! beside the ways, hast thou sat to them, like the Arabian m the desert,and hast defiled the land with thine unchastities, and with thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore have been withholden the showers, And, the latter rain, hath not come,Yet the forehead of an unchaste woman, hast thou, Thou hast refused to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Hast thou not from this time, cried unto me, My father! the friend of my youth, art, thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>Will he maintain his anger to times age-abiding? Will he keep it perpetually? Lo! thou hast spoken thus but hast done wicked things and had thy way!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>And Yahweh said unto me, in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what apostate Israel, did? She used to go upon every high mountain and beneath every green tree, and commit unchastity there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I said, after she had been doing all these things, Unto me, shall thou return? and she returned not,and her treacherous sister Judah saw it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>Though she saw that for all this, apostate Israel having committed adultery, I had sent her away, and had given a scroll of divorcement unto her, yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but, she also, went and committed unchastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>Yea though it had come to pass that through the levity of her unchastity, she had defiled the land,and committed adultery with Stone and with Tree,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>yet, in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah returned not unto me, with all her heart,but, falsely, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>Then said Yahweh unto me,Apostate Israel, hath justified herself,more than treacherous Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go, and proclaim these words, towards the North and sayReturn! thou apostateIsrael, Urgeth Yahweh, I will not lower my face against you,for full of lovingkindness, I am, Declareth Yahweh, I will not maintain    unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only, acknowledge thine iniquity, that against Yahweh thy God, hast thou transgressed,and hast gone hither and thither unto foreigners under every green tree, and unto my voice, ye have not hearkened Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, ye apostate sons, Urgeth Yahweh, for, I, am become your husband,therefore will I take you one of a city, and two of a family, and will bring you to Zion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>and will give you shepherds according to mine own heart,who will feed you with knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And it shall come to pass when ye shall be multiplied and become fruitful in the land, in those days, Declareth Yahweh, They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Neither shall it come up on the heart, Neither shall they remember it, Neither shall they miss it, Neither shall it be made any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time, shall they call Jerusalem, The throne of Yahweh, and there shall be gathered unto her all the nationsto the Name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem; and they shall walk no more after the stubbornness of their own wicked heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days, shall the house of Judah go unto the house of Israel,that they may enter together out of the land of the North, upon the land which I gave as an inheritance unto your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>Though, I myself, had said,How can I put thee among the sons, And give thee a land to be coveted, An inheritance of beauty, of the hosts of nations? Yet I said, My father, shalt thou call me, And away from me, shalt thou not turn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>But indeed   a wife goeth treacherously from her husband, so, have ye acted treacherously with me, O house of Israel, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice on the bare heights, is heard, The weeping of the supplications of the sons of Israel,Because they have perverted their way, Have forgotten Yahweh their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>Return ye apostate sons, I will heal your apostasies! Behold us! we have come unto thee, For thou, art Yahweh our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Surely, to falsehood, pertain the hills The noisy throng on the mountains,Surely, in Yahweh our God, is the salvation of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>But, the Shameful thing, hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: Their flocks, and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>We must lie down in our shame And our reproach, be our covering, For, against Yahweh our God, have we sinned, We and our fathers, from our youth even until this day,Neither have we hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh our God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>If thou wilt return, O Israel, Declareth Yahweh, Unto me, mayst thou return,And if thou wilt remove thine abominations from before me, Then shalt thou not become a wanderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>If thou wilt swear, By the life of Yahweh! in faithfulness in justice and in righteousness, Then shall the nations bless themselves in him, And, in him, shall they glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus saith Yahweh Unto the men of Judah and unto Jerusalem, Till ye the untilled ground,And do not sow among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves unto Yahweh So shall ye remove the impurity of your heart, ye men of Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,Lest mine indignation, go forth as fire, and burn and there be none to quench it, Because of the wickedness of your doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare ye in Judah And in Jerusalem, let it be heard, And say, Blow ye a horn in the land,Cry, with frill voice And say, Gather yourselves together, And let us enter the defenced cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Lift up an ensignZion-ward, Bring into safety, do not tarry,For, calamity, am, I, bringing in from the North, Even, a great destruction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>There hath come up a lion out of his thicket, Yea, a destroyer of nationshath set forward, hath come forth out of his place,To make thy land a desolation, Thy cities, shall fall in ruins, so as to have no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>On this account, gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl,Because the glow of the anger of Yahweh hath not turned from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>And it shall come to pass, in that day, Declareth Yahweh, That the courage of the king shall fail, And the courage of the princes,And the priests shall be astonished, And, the prophets, shall be amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then said I,Ah! My Lord Yahweh! Surely, thou hast suffered this people and Jerusalem to be beguiled, saying, Peace, shall ye have,whereas the sword shall reach unto the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time, shall it be said of this people and of Jerusalem,The sharp wind of the bare heights in the desert, cometh towards the daughter of my people,not to winnow nor to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>A wind too strong for these, cometh in for me. Now, will, I also, pronounce sentences upon them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Lo! like clouds, shall he come up, Even as a storm-wind, his chariots, Swifter than eagles, his horses,Woe to us for we are laid waste!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>Wash from wickedness thy heart, O Jerusalem, That thou mayest be saved,How long, shall lodge within thee thy wicked devices?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice, declareth from Dan,And publisheth trouble from the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Put ye in mind the nations Lo! publish ye against Jerusalem, Blockaders! are coming in from a land afar off,And have uttered against the cities of Judah their voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>As the keepers of a field, have they come against her round about,For against me, hath she rebelled, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Thine own way And thine own doings, Have done these things unto thee,This thy wickedness, Surely it is bitter, Surely it hath reached unto thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My bowels! My bowels! I am pained in the walls of my heart My heart beateth aloud to me I cannot be still! For the sound of a horn, hast thou heard O my soul, The loud shout of war!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Breach upon breach, they cry, For ruined, is all the land,Suddenly, are ruined my tents, In a moment, my curtains!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long shall I keep on seeing a standard,continue to hear the sound of a horn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>Surely, perverse, is my people Me, have they not known, Foolish sons, they are, Yea without understanding, they are: Wise, they are to commit wickedness, But how to do well, they know not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I beheld, The earth; and lo! it was waste and wild,The heavens also and their light was not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I beheld, The mountains, and lo! they were trembling,And all the hills, had been violently moved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I beheld, And lo! there was no human being,Yea, all the birds of the heavens! had fled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I beheld, And lo! the garden-land, was a desert,And, all its cities, had been broken down, Because of Yahweh, Because of the glow of his anger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For, thus, saith Yahweh, A desolation, shall all the land becomeNevertheless a full end, will I not make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this cause, shall the land mourn, and the heavens above be overcast: Because I have spoken have purposed, and have not repented nor will I turn back therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>At the noise of horseman and archer, The whole city is in flight, They have entered dark thickets, Yea unto the crags, have they gone up,Every city, is forsaken, There remaineth not in them a man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And when, thou, art laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with crimson Though thou deck thyself with ornaments of gold Though thou enlarge with antimony thine eyes, In vain, shalt thou make thyself fair,Paramours have rejected thee, Thy life, will they seek!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For a voice as of a woman in pangs, have I heard Anguish as of her that is bearing her firstborn. The voice of the daughter of Zion! She gaspeth for breath, She spreadeth forth her palms,Surely woe to me! For my soul fainteth before murderers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, And see I pray you and know and seek out in the broad places thereof, Whether ye can find, a man, Whether there is one Doing justice Demanding fidelity,That I may pardon her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.8'>The word which came unto Jeremiah, from Yahweh,after that King Zedekiah had solemnised a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem, proclaiming unto them liberty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.9'>that every man should let his servant and every man his handmaid, being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free,so that no man should use them as slaves, to wit a Jew his brother;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.11'>howbeit they turned after that, and brought back the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go, free, and brought them into subjection as servants and as handmaids,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.12'>So then the word of Yahweh came unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.13'>Thus, saith Yahweh God of Israel,I myself, solemnised a covenant with your fathers, in the day when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.14'>At the end of seven years, shall ye let go every man his brother, being a Hebrew, who shall sell himself unto thee and serve thee, six years, then shalt thou let him go, free, from thee, Howbeit your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.15'>And, though, ye, just now turned and did that which was right in mine eyes, by proclaiming liberty, every man to his neighbour,and solemnised a covenant before me, in the house on which my Name hath been called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.16'>yet have ye turned and profaned my Name, and brought back, every man his servant and every man his hand-maid, whom ye had let go, free, at their own desire,and have brought them into subjection, to become your servants and handmaids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.17'>ThereforeThus, saith Yahweh, Ye, have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every man to his brother and every man to his neighbour: Behold me! proclaiming, to you, a liberty: Declareth Yahweh unto the sword, unto the pestilence, and unto the famine, so will I make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.18'>and will give the men who are transgressing my covenant, in that they have not confirmed the words of the covenant, which they solemnised, before me, when they cut the calf, in twain, and passed between the parts thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.34.19'>even the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land,who passed between the parts of the calf,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.34.21'>Zedekiah king of Judah also with his princes, will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them who are seeking their life,even into the hand of the force of the king of Babylon, who are going up from you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.1'>The word which came unto Jeremiah from Yahweh,in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.3'>So I took Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons,and all the house of the Rechabites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.4'>and brought them into the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God,which was beside the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum keeper of the porch;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.5'>and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups,and said unto them Drink ye wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.6'>Then said they,We will not drink wine,for Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, laid command upon us, saying, Ye shall not drink wine, ye, nor your sons, unto times age-abiding;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.8'>So we have hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab, son of Rechab, our father, in all that be commanded us,not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons nor our daughters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.9'>and not to bud houses for us to dwell in,and so, vineyard or field or seed, have we none;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.35.16'>Because the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have, confirmed, the commandment of their father which he commanded them,whereas, this people, have not hearkened unto me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.35.17'>Therefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of hosts, God of Israel, Behold me! bringing in against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the calamity, which I have spoken concerning them,Because I spake unto them and they did not hearken, And I called to them and they did not answer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.1'>And it came to pass, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.2'>Take thee a scroll, and write therein all the words which I have spoken unto thee concerning Israel and concerning Judah and concerning all the nations,from the day I began to speak unto thee from the days of Josiah, even until this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.3'>Peradventure, the house of Judah will hearken unto all the calamity, which I am devising to execute against them,to the end they may return every man from his wicked way, whereupon I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.4'>So Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah,and Baruch wrote, from the mouth of Jeremiah, all the words of Yahweh which he had spoken unto him upon a scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.5'>Then did Jeremiah command Baruch, saying,I, am hindered, I cannot enter the house of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.6'>Thou, therefore shalt enter and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in the house of Yahweh on the day of a fast,moreover also, in the ears of all Judah who are coming in out of their cities, shalt thou read them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.7'>Peradventure, their supplication, will fall prostrate, before Yahweh, and they return every man from his wicked way,For, great, are the anger and the indignation which Yahweh hath spoken against this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.8'>So then Baruch son of Neriah did according to all which Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Yahweh in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.9'>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah in the ninth month, that all the people of Jerusalem, and all the people who were coming in out of the cities of Judah into Jerusalem, had proclaimed a fast before Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.10'>Baruch, therefore, read in the book the words of Jeremiah, in the house of Yahweh,in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphanthe scribe, in the upper court, at the opening of the new gate of the house of Yahweh, in the ears of all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.11'>When Micaiah, son of Gemariah son of Shaphan, heard all the words of Yahweh out of the book,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.12'>then went he down unto the house of the king up to the chamber of the scribe, and lo! there, all the princes sitting,Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan son of Achbor, and Gemariah son of Shaphan and Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the princes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.13'>So Micaiah told them all the words which he heard,when Baruch read in the book in the ears of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.14'>All the princes, therefore sent unto Baruch, Jehudi, son of Nethaniah son of Shelemiah son of Cushi saying, The roll wherein thou didst read in the ears of the people, take it in thy hand, and come, So Baruch son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came in unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.15'>Then said they unto him, Sit down we pray thee and read it in our ears, So Baruch read it in their ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.16'>And it came to pass when they heard all the words, that they turned with fear one to another,and said unto Baruch, We must, surely tell, the king, all these words!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.18'>So Baruch said unto them, With his own mouth, used he to proclaim unto me all these words,and I kept on writing in the book, with ink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.19'>Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man, know where ye, are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.20'>Then went they in unto the king, into the court, but the roll, had they put in charge, in the chamber of Elishama the scribe,so they declared in the ears of the king all the words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.21'>The king, therefore sent, Jehudi, to fetch the roll, and he fetched it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe,and Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who were standing near the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.22'>Now, the king, was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month,with the fire-stove before him burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.23'>So then it came to pass when Jehudi had read three or four columns that he cut it up into fragments with a scribes knife, and cast them into the fire that was in the stove,until, all the roll, was consumed on the fire that was on the stove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.24'>Yet were they not in dread, neither rent they their garments,the king, nor any of his servants that were hearing all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.25'>Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah, interceded with the king, not to burn the roll,but he hearkened not unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.26'>Then did the king command Jerahmeel son of the king, and Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to fetch Baruch the scribe, and Jeremiah the prophet,but Yahweh had hid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.27'>Then came the word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, after the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremiah saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.28'>Again take thee another roll, and write thereon, all the former words which were on the first roll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.29'>But unto Jehoiakim king of Judah, shalt thou say, Thus, saith Yahweh,Thou, hast burned this roll saying, Why hast thou written thereonsaying, The king of Babylon shall, certainly, come and lay waste this land, and cause to cease therefrom man and beast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.30'>Therefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah,He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David,And, his dead body, shall be cast outto the heat by day, and to the frost by night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.31'>And I will visit upon him and upon his seed and upon his servants the punishment of their iniquity,and will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and against, the men of Judah, all the calamity, which I have spoken against them but they have not hearkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.32'>So, Jeremiah, took another roll and gave it unto Baruch son of Neriah the scribe, who wrote thereon, from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book, which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned, in the fire,and further were added thereunto many words like unto them</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.15'>Then were the princes wroth against Jeremiah, and smote him,and put him in prison, in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for that, had they made the prison.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.39.2'>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month on the ninth of the month, was the city broken into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.3'>Then came in all the princes of the king of Babylon, and sat in the middle gate,Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, chief eunuch Nergal-sharezer, chief soothsayer, and all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.4'>And it came to pass as soon as Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled, and went forth by night out of the city, by way of the kings garden, through the gate between the two walls,and he went forth by way of the waste plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.5'>But the force of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the waste plains of Jericho, and when they had taken him, they brought him up unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah, in the land of Hamath,and pronounced upon him sentences of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.6'>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah, in Riblah before his eyes,and all the nobles of Judah, did the king of Babylon slay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.7'>and the eyes of Zedekiah, did he put out, and bound him with fetters of bronze to bring him into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.8'>And the house of the king, and the houses of the people, did the Chaldeans burn with fire, and the walls of Jerusalem, brake they down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.9'>and the remnant of the people who were left in the city, and the disheartened who fell away unto him, and the remnant of the people who were left, did Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners, take captive to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.10'>But of the poor people, who had, nothing, did Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners, leave remaining in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and ploughed fields on the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.11'>Then Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave command, concerning Jeremiah,through Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.12'>Take him and, thine eyes, set thou upon him, and do not unto him any harmful thing,but just as he shall speak unto thee, so, shalt thou do with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.13'>So Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners, sent, also Nebushazban, chief of the eunuchs, and Nergal-sharezer chief of the magi, and all the chiefs of the king of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.14'>yea they sent and fetched Jeremiah out of the guard-court, and delivered him unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, to bring him forth into a home, so he dwelt in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.15'>Now unto Jeremiah, had come the word of Yahweh, while he was yet shut up in the guard-court, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.16'>Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,Thus saith Yahweh of hosts God of Israel, Behold me! bringing about my words against this city, for, calamityand not for blessing,and they shall come to pass before thee, in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.17'>But I will deliver thee in that day, Declareth Yahweh,and thou shalt not be given up into the hand of the men from the face of whom, thou, mightest shrink with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.39.18'>For I wilt, surely, deliver, thee, and by the sword, shalt thou not fall,but thou shalt have thine own life as a spoil, Because thou hast trusted in me, Declareth Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.40'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.1'>The thing that happened unto Jeremiah, from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners had let him go from Ramah,when he had taken him, he having been bound in fetters in the midst of all the captive-host of Jerusalem, and Judah, who were being carried away captive to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.2'>So then the, chief of the royal executioners took Jeremiah,and said unto him, Yahweh thy God had threatened this calamity against this place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.3'>and so Yahweh hath brought it about and done it just as he threatened,for ye have sinned against Yahweh, and have not hearkened unto his voice, and so this thing hath befallen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.4'>Now, therefore, lo! I have loosed thee today, from the fetters which were upon thy hand: If it be good in thine eyes to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will set urine eyes upon thee, but if evil in thine eyes to come with me into Babylon, forbear,see! all the land, is before thee, whither it may be good and right in thine eyes to go, thither, go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.5'>And ere yet he could make replyGo thou back then unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath set in charge over the cities of Judah, and dwell thou with him in the midst of the people, or whithersoever it may be right in thine eyes to go, go! So the chief of the royal executioners gave him an allowance and a present and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.6'>Then came Jeremiah unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.7'>Now, when all the captains of the forces which were in the fieldthey and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had set Gedaliah son of Ahikam in charge over the land,and that he had committed to him men and women and children, and the poor of the land of those who had not been carried away captive to Babylon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.8'>then came they in unto Gedaliah in Mizpah,both Ishmael son of Nethaniah and Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, and Seraiah son of Tanhumeth and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite, they and their men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.9'>Then Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan swats unto them, and to their men saying, Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans,dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon that it may be well with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.10'>But as for me, behold me! remaining in Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who may come unto us, Ye, however, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your reties which ye have seized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.11'>Likewise also, all the Jews, who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom and who were in any of the lands, when they heard that the king of Babylon had granted a remnant to Judah, and that he had set in charge over them Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.12'>yea, then returned all the Jews out of all the places whither they had been driven, and came into the land of Judah unto Gedaliah, in Mizpah,and gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.13'>But, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the princes of the forces which were in the field, came unto Gedaliah in Mizpah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.14'>and said unto himDost thou at all know, that, Baalis, king of the sons of Ammon, hath sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah, to smite thee to death? But Gedaliah son of Ahikam, believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.15'>Then, Johanan son of Kareah, spake unto Gedaliah secretly, in Mizpah, saying,Let me go I pray thee, and smite Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and not, a man, shall know it,wherefore should he smite thee to death, and all Judah who have gathered themselves unto thee, be dispersed, and the remnant of Judah perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.40.16'>Then said Gedaliah son of Ahikam unto Johanan son of Kareah, Thou mayest not do this thing,for, falsely, art thou speaking against Ishmael.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.41'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.1'>And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama of the seed royal and chiefs of the king, and ten men with him, came in, unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam, at Mizpah,and they did there eat bread together in Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.2'>Then arose Ishmael son of Nethaniahand the ten men who were with him and they smote Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphanwith the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had set in charge, over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.3'>And Ishmael smote, all the Jews who were with him even with Gedaliah in Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there the men of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.4'>And it came to pass, on the second day, after he had slain Gedaliah, not, a man, knowing it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.5'>that men came in from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,eighty men, with beards shaven and clothes rent who also had cut themselves, with a meal-offering and frankincense in their hand, to bring them into the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.6'>Then went forth Ishmael son of Nethaniah to meet them out of Mizpah, weeping all along as he went,and it came to pass when he fell in with them, that he said unto them, Come ye in unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.7'>And so it was when they had come into the midst of the city, that Ishmael son of Nethaniah slew them and east them into the midst of a pit, he and the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.8'>But, ten men, were found among them, who said unto IshmaelDo not put us to death, for we have secret treasures in the field, wheat and barley and oil and honey, So he forbare and put them not to death in the midst of their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.9'>Now the pit whereinto Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had smitten, was a large pit which King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,the same, did Ishmael son of Nethaniah fill with the slain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.10'>Then did Ishmael take captive all the remnant of the people that was in Mizpah,the daughters of the king, and all the people that were left remaining in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan chief of the royal executioners had committed unto Gedaliah son of Ahikam,yea Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive, and departed to pass over unto the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.11'>But when Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him heard of all the wickedness which Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.12'>then took they all the men, and went their way to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah,and found him near the many waters which were in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.13'>And it came to pass, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then were they glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.14'>So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive out of Mizpah, compassed about, and returned and went their way unto Johanan son of Kareah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.15'>But, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, escaped with eight men, from the face of Johanan,and departed unto the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.16'>Then did Johanan son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him take all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah out of Mizpah, after he had smitten Gedaliah son of Ahikam,mighty men, men of war, and women and children and eunuchs, whom he had recovered out of Gibeon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.17'>and they departed, and dwelt in the khan of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem,that they might go to enter Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.41.18'>because of the Chaldeans, for they were afraid of them,because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had set in charge over the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.42'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.1'>Then drew near all the captains of the forces, and Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah,and all the people from the least even unto the greatest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.2'>and said unto Jeremiah the prophetLet our supplication we beseech thee fall prostrate before thee, and pray thou in our behalf unto Yahweh thy God, in behalf of all this remnant,for we are left a few out of many, just as thine own eyes do behold us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.3'>that Yahweh thy God may tell us the way wherein we should walk,and the thing that we should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.4'>And Jeremiah the prophet, said unto them, I have heard; behold me! praying unto Yahweh your God according to your words,and it shall come to pass that the whole thing that Yahweh shall answer you, I will tell you, I will keep back from you, nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.5'>They, therefore said unto Jeremiah, Yahweh be against us, as a witness true and faithful,if according to all the word which Yahweh thy God shall send thee unto us, so we do not perform:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.6'>whether for good or for ill, unto the voice of Yahweh our God for which we are sending thee unto him, will we hearken,to the end it may be well with us, because we will hearken unto the voice of Yahweh our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.7'>And it came to pass at the end of ten days, that the word of Yahweh came unto Jeremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.8'>Then called he for Johanan son of Kareah, and for all the princes of the forces who were with himand for all the people from the least even unto the greatest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.9'>and said unto them, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israelunto whom ye sent me, to cause your supplication to fall prostrate before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.10'>If ye will indeed abide, in this land, then will I build you up, and not pull   ,for I have compassion as touching the calamity which I have caused you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.11'>Do not fear the face of the king of Babylon, of whose face ye are afraid,do not fear him, Urgeth Yahweh, for with you, am I, to save you, and to deliver you out of his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.12'>that I may grant you compassions and he may have compassion upon you,and suffer you to return unto your own soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.13'>But, since ye are saying,We will not dwell in this land,nor hearken unto the voice of Yahweh your God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.14'>saying,No! for, into the land of Egypt, will we go, where we shall not see war, nor the sound of a horn, shall we hear,nor for bread, shall we be famished,there, then will we dwell</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.15'>Now, therefore, for this cause, hear ye the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah,Thus! saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel,If, ye do indeed set your faces to enter Egypt and do enter to sojourn there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.16'>then shall it come to pass that the sword which ye are fearing shall, there, overtake you, in the land of Egypt,and the famine which ye are dreading, shall, there, lay fast hold of you, in Egypt, and, there, shall ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.17'>So shall it be with all the men who have set their faces to enter Egypt to sojourn there, they shah die by sword, by famine or by pestilence,and they shall have neither survival nor escape, from the face of the calamity which I am about to bring in upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.18'>ForThus, saith Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel,Just as mine anger and mine indignation have been poured out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall mine indignation be poured out upon you when ye enter into Egypt,thus shall ye become a curse, and an astonishment and a contempt and a reproach, and ye shall no more see this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.19'>Yahweh hath spoken concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah, Do not enter into Egypt: Know certainly, that I have taken you to witness to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.20'>For ye have deceived yourselves at the cost of your lives, for, ye yourselves, sent me unto Yahweh your God, saying,Pray thou in our behalf, unto Yahweh our God,and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say, so, tell us and we will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.42.21'>Therefore have I told you to-day,and yet ye have not hearkened unto the voice of Yahweh your God, even in any thing for which he hath sent me unto you.</verse>
