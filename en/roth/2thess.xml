        <title>So then, be consoling one another with these words.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timothyunto the assembly of Thessalonians, in God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God   Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We are bound, to be giving thanks, unto God, continually, concerning you, brethren, even as it is, meet; because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all one to another aboundeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>So that, we ourselves, in you, are boasting, in the assemblies of God, over your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations which ye are sustaining:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>A proof of the righteous judgment of God, to the end ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, in behalf of which ye are also suffering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>If, at least, it is a, righteous thing with God, to recompense, affliction, unto them that afflict you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>And, unto you that are afflicted, release, with us,by the revealing of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with his messengers of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>In a fiery flame; holding forth vengeanceagainst them that refuse to know God, and them who decline to hearken unto the glad-message of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>Who, indeed, a penalty, shall payage-abiding destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>Whensoever he shall come, to be made all-glorious in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all who believed,because our witness unto you was believed,in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>Unto which end, we are also praying continually for you, that our God may count, you, worthy of your calling, and fulfil every good-pleasure of goodness and work of faith, with power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>That the name of our Lord Jesus may be made all-glorious in you, and, ye, in him, according o the favour of our God and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>But we request you, brethren,in behalf of the Presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>That ye be not quickly tossed from your mind, nor be put in alarmeither by spirit, or by discourse, or by letter as by us, as that the day of the Lord, hath set in:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>That no one may cheat, you, in any one respect. Because   except the revolt come first, and there he revealed the man of lawlessness, the son of destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>The one who opposeth and exalteth himself on high against every one called God, or an object of worship; so that he, within the sanctuary of God, shall take his seat, showeth himself forth, that he is, God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Remember ye not, that, while I was yet with you, these very things, I was telling you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And, what now restraineth, ye know, to the end he may be revealed in his own fitting time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For, the secret, of lawlessness, already, is inwardly working itself,only, until, he that restraineth at present, shall be gone, out of the midst:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And, then, shall be revealed the lawless one,whom, the Lord  Jesus , will slay with the Spirit of his mouth, and paralyse with the forthshining of his Presence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>Whose, presence,   according to an inworking of Satan, with all manner of mighty work and sign and wonders of falsehood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>And with all manner of deceit of unrighteousness, in them who are destroying themselves, because, the love of the truth, they did not welcome, that they might be saved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And, for this cause, God sendeth them an inworking of error, to the end they should believe in the falsehood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>In order that should be judged who would not believe in the truth, but were well-pleased with the unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But, we, are bound to give thanks unto God continually concerning you, brethren beloved by the Lord, for that God chose you, from the beginning, unto salvation, in sanctification of spirit and belief of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>Unto which he called you, through means of our glad-message, unto an acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Hence, then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye were taughtwhether through discourse, or through our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>But may, our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father,Who hath loved you, and given you age-abiding consolation and good hope by favour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>Console your hearts, and confirm you in every good work and word!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>For the rest, brethren, be praying for us,that, the word of the Lord, may be running, and gaining glory, according as   even with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>And that we may be rescued from the presuming and wicked men; for, not all, hold the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>Faithful, is the Lord,who will confirm you, and guard you from the wicked one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>We are persuaded, however, in the Lord, as touching you,that, what things we give in charge, Ye  both  are doing and will do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>But may, the Lord, guide your hearts into the love of God, and into the endurance of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Howbeit, we charge you, brethren,that, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, ye be withdrawing yourselves from every brotherwho, in a disorderly way, doth walk, and not according to the instruction which ye received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For, ye yourselves, know, how needful it is to be imitating us, in that we were not disorderly among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>Nor, as a free-gift, did eat, bread, from anyone, but, with toil and hardship, night and day, working,that we might not burden any of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we have not authority, but that, ourselves, as an ensample, we might hold forth unto you,to the end ye might he imitating us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For, even when we were with you, this, were we giving in charge unto you,that, if any will not work, neither let him eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>We hear, in fact, of some who are walking among you in a disorderly way, at nothing, working, yet too busily working!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now, such as these, we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ,that, with quietness, working, their own bread, they be eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But, ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>And, if anyone be not giving ear unto our word through means of this letter, on this one, set a marknot to be mixing yourselves up with him,that he may be reproved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>And, not as an enemy, be esteeming him, but be admonishing him, as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>But may, the Lord of peace himself, give you peace, always, in every way. The Lord, be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation of Paulwith my own hand, which is a sign in every letter: thus, I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with you all.</verse>
