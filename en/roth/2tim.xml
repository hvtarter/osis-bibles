        <title>In the same way, the noble works also, are openly evident,and, they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through the will of God,according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>Unto Timothy, my beloved child: Favour, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>Grateful, am I, unto God,unto whom I am rendering divine service from my progenitors in a pure conscience, that, incessant, hold I the remembrance, concerning thee, in my supplications; day and night,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears,in order that, with joy, I may be filled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>A reminder, having received, of the unfeigned faith, that is in thee,such, as dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice,I am persuaded, moreover, that</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>For which cause, I put thee in remembrance, to be stirring up Gods gift of favour, which is in thee through means of the laying on of my hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God hath not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and love, and correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Be not thou, therefore, put to shamewith regard to the witness of our Lord, nor with regard to me his prisoner; but suffer hardship together with the glad-message according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>Who hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to the peculiar purpose and favourwhich was given to us in Christ Jesus before age-during times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But hath now been made manifest through means of the forthshining of our Saviour Christ Jesus,Who, indeed, hath abolished death, and hath thrown light upon life and incorruptibility, through means of the glad-message:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>Whereunto, I, have been appointed herald and apostle and teacher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause, these things also, am I suffering; nevertheless I am not being put to shame, for I know him whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is, able, to guard, that which I have entrusted,   unto, that, day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>An outline, have thou, of healthful discourses which from me thou hast heardwith the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>The noble thing entrusted</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>Thou knowest thisthat all they who are in Asia have turned away from me,of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord grant mercy unto the house, of Onesiphorus, in that, ofttimes, hath he refreshed me, and, as regardeth my chain, hath not been put to shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>But, happening to be in Rome, he diligently sought out and found me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord grant him to find mercy from</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou, therefore, my child, be empowering thyself in the favour that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And, the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same, entrust thou unto faithful men, such as shall be, competent, to teach, others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Take thy part in suffering hardship, as a brave soldier of Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No one that is serving as a soldier, entangleth himself with the matters of his livelihood, that he may please him that hath summoned him to serve as a soldier;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>If, moreover, any man, contend even in the games, he is not crowned, unless, lawfully, he contend;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The toiling husbandman, ought, first, of the fruits, to partake:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Think, as to what I am speaking; for the Lord will give thee discernment in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Keep in mind Jesus Christraised from among the dead, of the seed of David,according to my joyful message:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>In which I am suffering hardship, even unto bonds, as an evil-doer; but, the word of God, is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>For this cause, am I enduring, all things, for the sake of the chosen, in order that, they also, may obtain, the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus along with glory age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>Faithful, the sayingfor, If we have died together, we shall also live together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we endure, we shall also reign together; If we shall deny, he also, will deny us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we are faithless, he, faithful, abideth,for, deny himself, he cannot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Of these things, be putting   before God not to be waging word-battles,useful, for nothing, occasioning a subversion of them that hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Give diligence, thyself, approved, to present unto God,a workman not to be put to shame, skillfully handling the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But, the profane pratings, shun; for, unto more ungodliness, will they force themselves on;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And, their discourse, as a gangrene, will eat its way;of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>Men who, concerning the truth, have erred, affirming, a resurrection, already, to have taken place, and are overthrowing the faith, of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>Howbeit, the firm foundation of God, standeth, having this sealThe Lord hath acknowledged them who are his, and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord stand aloof from unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But, in a great house, there are not only gold and silver vessels, but, also wooden and earthen: and, some, indeed, for honour, while, some, are for dishonour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If, therefore, anyone will, for pureness, sever himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, hallowed, meet for the Masters use, for every good work, prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>But, from the youthful covetings, flee! and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with them who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But, from the foolish and undisciplined questionings, excuse thyself, knowing that they gender strifes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And, a servant of the Lord, ought not to strive, but to be, gentle, towards all, apt in teaching, ready to endure malice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>In meekness, bringing under discipline them that oppose themselves, lest at any time God should give them repentance unto a personal knowledge of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>And they should wake up to sobriety out of, the adversarys, snare,though they have been taken alive by him for, that ones, will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But, of this, be taking notethat, in last days, there will set in perilous seasons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will befond of themselves, fond of money, ostentatious, arrogant, defamers, to parents, unyielding, unthankful, unkind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>without natural affection, accepting no truce, given to intrigue, without self-control, uncivilized, unfriendly to good men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>traitors, reckless, beclouded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>having a form of godliness, but, the power thereof, denying! and, from these, turn away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For, of these, are they who enter into the houses, and captivate silly women,   laden with sins, led on by manifold covetings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>Ever learning and never, unto a personal knowledge of truth, able to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Moreover, like as, Jannes and Jambres, withstood Moses, so, these men also, withstand the truth,men utterly corrupted in their mind, disapproved concerning their faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they shall not force their way further, for, their folly, shall be, fully evident, unto all,as also, that of those men, became.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But, thou, hast closely studiedmy teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>persecutions, sufferings, what manner of things, befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, what manner of persecutions, I endured,and, out of all, the Lord, rescued me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yea and, all who are determined to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus, will be persecuted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>Whereas, wicked men and howling impostors, will force their way to the worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But, thou,abide in the things which thou hast learned, and been entrusted with, knowing, from whom, thou hast learned   ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that, from a babe, those sacred letters, thou hast known which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through the faith which is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>Every scripture,   God-breathed, and profitableunto teaching, unto conviction, unto correction, unto the discipline that is in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>In order that, ready, may be the man, of God, unto every good work, being well-prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I adjure   before God, and Christ JesusWho is about to be judging living and dead,both as to his forthshining and his kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Proclaim the word, take thy positionin season, out of season,convince, rebuke, encourage,with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For there will be a seasonwhen, the healthful teaching, they will not endure, but, according to their own covetings, will, unto themselves, heap up teachers, because they have an itching ear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>And, from the truth, indeed, their ear, will they turn away, while, unto stories, they will turn themselves aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But, thou,be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do, the work, of an evangelist, thy ministry, completely fulfill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For, I, already, am being poured out as a drink-offering, and, the season of my release, is at hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>The noble contest, have I contested, the race, have I finished, the faith, have I kept:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Henceforth, lieth by for methe crown, of righteousness, which the Lord will render unto me in that, day,The righteous judge,Ye, not alone unto me, but unto all them also who have loved his forthshining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Give diligence to come unto me speedily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For, Demas, hath forsaken me, having loved the present age, and hath journeyed unto Thessalonica; Crescens unto Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Luke, alone is with me. Receiving, Mark, back, bring him with thyself, for he is very useful to me for ministering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>and, Tychicus, have I sent unto Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak that I left in Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring; and the scrolls, especially, the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith, of much baseness towards me, hath given proof,the Lord will render unto him according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>Of whom, be, thou also, on thy guard, for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>In my first defence, no man, came in to help me, but, all, forsook me,unto them, may it not be reckoned!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But, the Lord, stood by me, and empowered me, in order that, through me, the proclamation, might be fully made, and, all the nations, might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of a lion:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus, remained in Corinth; but, Trophimus, I left at Miletus, sick.</verse>
