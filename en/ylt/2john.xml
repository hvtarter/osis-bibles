      <chapter osisID='2John.1'>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I  love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known  the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us  shall be to the age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the  Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father,  in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of thy children  walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the  Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>and now I beseech thee, Kyria, not as writing to thee a new  command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love  one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>and this is the love, that we may walk according to His  commands; this is the command, even as ye did hear from the  beginning, that in it ye may walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>because many leading astray did enter into the world, who  are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is  he who is leading astray, and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>See to yourselves that ye may not lose the things that we  wrought, but a full reward may receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the  teaching of the Christ, hath not God; he who is remaining in  the teaching of the Christ, this one hath both the Father and  the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>if any one doth come unto you, and this teaching doth not  bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him,  `Hail!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who is saying to him, `Hail,` hath fellowship with  his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Many things having to write to you, I did not intend  through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak  mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>salute thee do the children of thy choice sister. Amen.</verse>
