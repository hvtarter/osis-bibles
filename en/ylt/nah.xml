        <verse osisID='Nah.1.1'>Burden of Nineveh. The Book of the Vision of Nahum the  Elkoshite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.2'>A God zealous and avenging [is] Jehovah, An avenger [is]  Jehovah, and possessing fury. An avenger [is] Jehovah on His  adversaries, And He is watching for His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.3'>Jehovah [is] slow to anger, and great in power, And Jehovah  doth not entirely acquit, In a hurricane and in a tempest [is]  His way, And a cloud [is] the dust of His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.4'>He is pushing against a sea, and drieth it up, Yea, all the  floods He hath made dry, Languishing [are] Bashan and Carmel,  Yea, the flower of Lebanon [is] languishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.5'>Mountains have shaken because of Him, And the hills have  been melted; And lifted up [is] the earth at His presence, And  the world and all dwelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.6'>Before His indignation who doth stand? And who riseth up in  the heat of His anger? His fury hath been poured out like fire,  And the rocks have been broken by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.7'>Good [is] Jehovah for a strong place in a day of distress.  And He knoweth those trusting in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.8'>And with a flood passing over, An end He maketh of its  place, And His enemies doth darkness pursue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.9'>What do we devise against Jehovah? An end He is making,  arise not twice doth distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.10'>For while princes [are] perplexed, And with their drink are  drunken, They have been consumed as stubble fully dried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.11'>From thee hath come forth a deviser of evil Against Jehovah  -- a worthless counsellor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.12'>Thus said Jehovah: Though complete, and thus many, Yet thus  they have been cut off, And he hath passed away. And I  afflicted thee, I afflict thee no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.13'>And now I break his rod from off thee, And thy bands I do  draw away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.14'>And commanded concerning thee hath Jehovah, `No more of thy  name doth spread abroad, From the house of thy gods I cut off  graven and molten image, I appoint thy grave, for thou hast  been vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.15'>Lo, on the mountains the feet of one proclaiming tidings,  sounding peace! Celebrate, O Judah, thy festivals, complete thy  vows, For add no more to pass over into thee doth the  worthless, He hath been completely cut off!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Nah.2'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.1'>Come up hath a scatterer to thy face, Keep the bulwark,  watch the way, Strengthen the loins, strengthen power mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.2'>For turned back hath Jehovah to the excellency of Jacob, As  [to] the excellency of Israel, For emptied them out have  emptiers, And their branches they have marred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.3'>The shield of his mighty ones is become red, Men of might  [are in] scarlet, With fiery torches [is] the chariot in a day  of his preparation, And the firs have been caused to tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.4'>In out-places shine do the chariots, They go to and fro in  broad places, Their appearances [are] like torches, As  lightnings they run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.5'>He doth remember his honourable ones, They stumble in their  goings, They hasten [to] its wall, and prepared is the  covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.6'>Gates of the rivers have been opened, And the palace is  dissolved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.7'>And it is established -- she hath removed, She hath been  brought up, And her handmaids are leading as the voice of  doves, Tabering on their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.8'>And Nineveh [is] as a pool of waters, From of old it [is] --  and they are fleeing! `Stand ye, stand;` and none is turning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.9'>Seize ye silver, seize ye gold, And there is no end to the  prepared things, [To] the abundance of all desirable vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.10'>She is empty, yea, emptiness and waste, And the heart hath  melted, And the knees have smitten together, And great pain  [is] in all loins, And the faces of all of them have gathered  paleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.11'>Where [is] the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place  it [is] for young lions Where walked hath a lion, an old lion,  A lion`s whelp, and there is none troubling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.12'>The lion is tearing parts [for] his whelps, And is  strangling for his lionesses, And he doth fill [with] prey his  holes, And his habitations [with] rapine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.13'>Lo, I [am] against thee, An affirmation of Jehovah of  Hosts, And I have burned in smoke its chariot, And thy young  lions consume doth a sword, And I have cut off from the land  thy prey, And not heard any more is the voice of thy  messengers!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Nah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.1'>Wo [to] the city of blood, She is all with lies -- burglary  -- full, Prey doth not depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.2'>The sound of a whip, And the sound of the rattling of a  wheel, And of a prancing horse, and of a bounding chariot, Of a  horseman mounting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.3'>And the flame of a sword, and the lightning of a spear, And  the abundance of the wounded, And the weight of carcases, Yea,  there is no end to the bodies, They stumble over their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.4'>Because of the abundance of the fornications of an harlot,  The goodness of the grace of the lady of witchcrafts, Who is  selling nations by her fornications, And families by her  witchcrafts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.5'>Lo, I [am] against thee, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts,  And have removed thy skirts before thy face, And have shewed  nations thy nakedness, And kingdoms thy shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.6'>And I have cast upon thee abominations, And dishonoured  thee, and made thee as a sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.7'>And it hath come to pass, Each of thy beholders fleeth from  thee, And hath said: `Spoiled is Nineveh, Who doth bemoan for  her?` Whence do I seek comforters for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.8'>Art thou better than No-Ammon, That is dwelling among  brooks? Waters she hath round about her, Whose bulwark [is] the  sea, waters her wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.9'>Cush her might, and Egypt, and there is no end. Put and  Lubim have been for thy help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.10'>Even she doth become an exile, She hath gone into  captivity, Even her sucklings are dashed to pieces At the top  of all out-places, And for her honoured ones they cast a lot,  And all her great ones have been bound in fetters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.11'>Even thou art drunken, thou art hidden, Even thou dost seek  a strong place, because of an enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.12'>All thy fortresses [are] fig-trees with first-fruits, If  they are shaken, They have fallen into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.13'>Lo, thy people [are] women in thy midst, To thine enemies  thoroughly opened Have been the gates of thy land, Consumed  hath fire thy bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.14'>Waters of a siege draw for thyself, Strengthen thy  fortresses, Enter into mire, and tread on clay, Make strong a  brick-kiln.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.15'>There consume thee doth a fire, Cut thee off doth a sword,  It doth consume thee as a cankerworm! Make thyself heavy as the  cankerworm, Make thyself heavy as the locust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.16'>Multiply thy merchants above the stars of the heavens, The  cankerworm hath stripped off, and doth flee away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.17'>Thy crowned ones [are] as a locust, And thy princes as  great grasshoppers, That encamp in hedges in a day of cold, The  sun hath risen, and it doth flee away, And not known is its  place where they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.18'>Slumbered have thy friends, king of Asshur, Rest do thine  honourable ones, Scattered have been thy people on the  mountains, And there is none gathering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.19'>There is no weakening of thy destruction, Grievous [is] thy  smiting, All hearing thy fame have clapped the hand at thee,  For over whom did not thy wickedness pass continually?</verse>
