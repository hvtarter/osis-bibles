      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How hath she sat alone, The city abounding with people! She  hath been as a widow, The mighty among nations! Princes among  provinces, She hath become tributary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weepeth sore in the night, And her tear [is] on her  cheeks, There is no comforter for her out of all her lovers,  All her friends dealt treacherously by her, They have been to  her for enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Removed hath Judah because of affliction, And because of the  abundance of her service; She hath dwelt among nations, She  hath not found rest, All her pursuers have overtaken her  between the straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion are mourning, Without any coming at the  appointed time, All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh,  Her virgins are afflicted -- and she hath bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries have become chief, Her enemies have been at  ease, For Jehovah hath afflicted her, For the abundance of her  transgressions, Her infants have gone captive before the  adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And go out from the daughter of Zion doth all her honour,  Her princes have been as harts -- They have not found pasture,  And they go powerless before a pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Remembered hath Jerusalem [In] the days of her affliction  and her mournings, all her desirable things that were from the  days of old, In the falling of her people into the hand of an  adversary, And she hath no helper; Seen her have adversaries,  They have laughed at her cessation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>A sin hath Jerusalem sinned, Therefore impure she hath  become, All who honoured her have esteemed her lightly, For  they have seen her nakedness, Yea, she herself hath sighed and  turneth backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her uncleanness [is] in her skirts, She hath not remembered  her latter end, And she cometh down wonderfully, There is no  comforter for her. See, O Jehovah, mine affliction, For exerted  himself hath an enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>His hand spread out hath an adversary On all her desirable  things, For she hath seen -- Nations have entered her  sanctuary, Concerning which Thou didst command, `They do not  come into the assembly to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people are sighing -- seeking bread, They have  given their desirable things For food to refresh the body; See,  O Jehovah, and behold attentively, For I have been lightly  esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>[Is it] nothing to you, all ye passing by the way? Look  attentively, and see, If there is any pain like my pain, That  He is rolling to me? Whom Jehovah hath afflicted In the day of  the fierceness of His anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From above He hath sent fire into my bone, And it subdueth  it, He hath spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me  backward, He hath made me desolate -- all the day sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>Bound hath been the yoke of my transgressions by His hand,  They are wrapped together, They have gone up on my neck, He  hath caused my power to stumble, The Lord hath given me into  hands, I am not able to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>Trodden down all my mighty ones hath the Lord in my midst,  He proclaimed against me an appointed time, To destroy my young  men, A wine-press hath the Lord trodden, To the virgin daughter  of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these I am weeping, My eye, my eye, is running down  with waters, For, far from me hath been a comforter, Refreshing  my soul, My sons have been desolate, For mighty hath been an  enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Spread forth hath Zion her hands, There is no comforter for  her, Jehovah hath charged concerning Jacob, His neighbours  [are] his adversaries, Jerusalem hath become impure among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>Righteous is Jehovah, For His mouth I have provoked. Hear,  I pray you, all ye peoples, and see my pain, My virgins and my  young men have gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my lovers, they -- they have deceived me, My  priests and my elders in the city have expired; When they have  sought food for themselves, Then they give back their soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>See, O Jehovah, for distress [is] to me, My bowels have  been troubled, Turned hath been my heart in my midst, For I  have greatly provoked, From without bereaved hath the sword, In  the house [it is] as death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They have heard that I have sighed, There is no comforter  for me, All my enemies have heard of my calamity, They have  rejoiced that Thou hast done [it], Thou hast brought in the day  Thou hast called, And they are like to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Come in doth all their evil before Thee, And one is doing  to them as Thou hast done to me, For all my transgressions, For  many [are] my sighs, and my heart [is] sick!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How doth the Lord cloud in His anger the daughter of Zion,  He hath cast from heaven [to] earth the beauty of Israel, And  hath not remembered His footstool in the day of His anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>Swallowed up hath the Lord, He hath not pitied any of the  pleasant places of Jacob, He hath broken down in His wrath The  fortresses of the daughter of Judah, He hath caused to come to  the earth, He polluted the kingdom and its princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He hath cut off in the heat of anger every horn of Israel,  He hath turned backward His right hand From the face of the  enemy, And He burneth against Jacob as a flaming fire, It hath  devoured round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He hath trodden His bow as an enemy, Stood hath His right  hand as an adversary, And He slayeth all the desirable ones of  the eye, In the tent of the daughter of Zion, He hath poured  out as fire His fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord hath been as an enemy, He hath swallowed up Israel,  He hath swallowed up all her palaces, He hath destroyed His  fortresses, And He multiplieth in the daughter of Judah  Mourning and moaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And He shaketh as a garden His tabernacle, He hath destroyed  His appointed place, Jehovah hath forgotten in Zion the  appointed time and sabbath, And despiseth, in the indignation  of His anger, king and priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord hath cast off His altar, He hath rejected His  sanctuary, He hath shut up into the hand of the enemy The walls  of her palaces, A noise they have made in the house of Jehovah  Like a day of appointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>Devised hath Jehovah to destroy the wall of the daughter of  Zion, He hath stretched out a line, He hath not turned His hand  from destroying, And He causeth bulwark and wall to mourn,  Together -- they have been weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Sunk into the earth have her gates, He hath destroyed and  broken her bars, Her king and her princes [are] among the  nations, There is no law, also her prophets Have not found  vision from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>Sit on the earth -- keep silent do the elders of the  daughter of Zion, They have caused dust to go up on their head,  They have girded on sackcloth, Put down to the earth their head  have the virgins of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>Consumed by tears have been my eyes, Troubled have been my  bowels, Poured out to the earth hath been my liver, For the  breach of the daughter of my people; In infant and suckling  being feeble, In the broad places of the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>To their mothers they say, `Where [are] corn and wine?` In  their becoming feeble as a pierced one In the broad places of  the city, In their soul pouring itself out into the bosom of  their mothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What do I testify [to] thee, what do I liken to thee, O  daughter of Jerusalem? What do I equal to thee, and I comfort  thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For great as a sea [is] thy  breach, Who doth give healing to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Thy prophets have seen for thee a false and insipid thing,  And have not revealed concerning thine iniquity, To turn back  thy captivity, And they see for thee false burdens and causes  of expulsion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>Clapped hands at thee have all passing by the way, They  have hissed -- and they shake the head At the daughter of  Jerusalem: `Is this the city of which they said: The perfection  of beauty, a joy to all the land?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>Opened against thee their mouth have all thine enemies,  They have hissed, yea, they gnash the teeth, They have said:  `We have swallowed [her] up, Surely this [is] the day that we  looked for, We have found -- we have seen.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>Jehovah hath done that which He devised, He hath fulfilled  His saying That He commanded from the days of old, He hath  broken down and hath not pitied, And causeth an enemy to  rejoice over thee, He lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Cried hath their heart unto the Lord; O wall of the  daughter of Zion, Cause to go down as a stream tears daily and  nightly, Give not rest to thyself, Let not the daughter of  thine eye stand still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry aloud in the night, At the beginning of the  watches. Pour out as water thy heart, Over against the face of  the Lord, Lift up unto Him thy hands, for the soul of thine  infants, Who are feeble with hunger at the head of all  out-places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>See, O Jehovah, and look attentively, To whom Thou hast  acted thus, Do women eat their fruit, infants of a handbreadth?  Slain in the sanctuary of the Lord are priest and prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>Lain on the earth [in] out-places have young and old, My  virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword, Thou hast  slain in a day of Thine anger, Thou hast slaughtered -- Thou  hast not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Thou dost call as [at] a day of appointment, My fears from  round about, And there hath not been in the day of the anger of  Jehovah, An escaped and remaining one, They whom I stretched  out and nourished, My enemy hath consumed!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I [am] the man [who] hath seen affliction By the rod of His  wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>Me He hath led, and causeth to go [in] darkness, and without  light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Surely against me He turneth back, He turneth His hand all  the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>He hath worn out my flesh and my skin. He hath broken my  bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>He hath built up against me, And setteth round poverty and  weariness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>In dark places He hath caused me to dwell, As the dead of  old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>He hath hedged me about, and I go not out, He hath made  heavy my fetter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Also when I call and cry out, He hath shut out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>He hath hedged my ways with hewn work, My paths He hath made  crooked.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>My ways He is turning aside, and He pulleth me in pieces,  He hath made me a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>He hath trodden His bow, And setteth me up as a mark for an  arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He hath caused to enter into my reins The sons of His  quiver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>I have been a derision to all my people, Their song all the  day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He hath filled me with bitter things, He hath filled me  [with] wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'>And He breaketh with gravel my teeth, He hath covered me  with ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>And Thou castest off from peace my soul, I have forgotten  prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>And I say, Perished hath my strength and my hope from  Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Remember my affliction and my mourning, Wormwood and gall!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>Remember well, and bow down doth my soul in me.</verse>
