      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother,  to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier,  and the assembly in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my  prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord  Jesus and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the  full knowledge of every good thing that [is] in you toward  Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the  bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee,  brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee  that which is fit --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as  Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in  my bonds -- Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to  me and to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own  bowels) receive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he  might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of  necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that  age-duringly thou mayest have him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother  beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in  the flesh and in the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to  me be reckoning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I  may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord;  refresh my bowels in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee,  having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I  hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ  Jesus,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit!  Amen.</verse>
