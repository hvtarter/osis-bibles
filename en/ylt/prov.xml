        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding  sayings of intelligence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness,  judgment, and uprightness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth --  knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>(The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the  intelligent doth obtain counsels.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the  wise and their acute sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and  instruction fools have despised!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not  the law of thy mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to  thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch  secretly for the innocent without cause,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those  going down [to] the pit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with]  spoil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of  us.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from  their path,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed  blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any  bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly  for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The  life of its owners it taketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she  giveth forth her voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings  of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>`Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have  scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit,  I make known my words with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my  hand, and none is attending,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not  desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear  cometh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as  a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me  earnestly, and find me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of  Jehovah have not chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised  all my reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own  counsels they are filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the  security of the foolish destroyeth them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And  [is] quiet from fear of evil!`</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost  lay up with thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy  heart to understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding  givest forth thy voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures  searchest for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of  God thou findest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and  understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those  walking uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He  preserveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and  uprightness -- every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul  is pleasant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth  keep thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward  things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of  darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness  of the wicked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their  ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger  who hath made smooth her sayings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant  of her God hath forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim  her paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the  paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of  the righteous dost keep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are  left in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous  dealers plucked out of it!</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart  keep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to  thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy  neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and  man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own  understanding lean not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy  paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside  from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of  all thine increase;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine  thy presses break forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not  vexed with His reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the  son He is pleased with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a  man [who] bringeth forth understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of  silver, And than gold -- her increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are  not comparable to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are]  wealth and honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths  [are] peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And  whoso is retaining her [is] happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the  heavens by understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop  dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom  and thoughtfulness,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of  his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with  the upright [is] His secret counsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And  the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth  give grace.</verse>
