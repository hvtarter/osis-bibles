      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners  of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and  Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in  sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of  the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be  multiplied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed [is] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  who, according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us  again to a living hope, through the rising again of Jesus  Christ out of the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and  unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith,  unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>in which ye are glad, a little now, if it be necessary,  being made to sorrow in manifold trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of  gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may  be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation  of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom, not having seen, ye love, in whom, now not seeing and  believing, ye are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>concerning which salvation seek out and search out did  prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching in regard to what or what manner of time the  Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying  beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us  they were ministering these, which now were told to you  (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy  Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire  to bend looking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being  sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to  you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the  former desires in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but according as He who did call you [is] holy, ye also,  become holy in all behaviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it hath been written, `Become ye holy, because I am  holy;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>and if on the Father ye do call, who without acceptance of  persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the  time of your sojourn pass ye,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>having known that, not with corruptible things -- silver or  gold -- were ye redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered  by fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and  unspotted -- Christ`s --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and  manifested in the last times because of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the  dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope  may be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth  through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure  heart one another love ye earnestly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>being begotten again, not out of seed corruptible, but  incorruptible, through a word of God -- living and remaining --  to the age;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>because all flesh [is] as grass, and all glory of man as  flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell  away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>and the saying of the Lord doth remain -- to the age; and  this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and  hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as new-born babes the word`s pure milk desire ye, that in it  ye may grow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if so be ye did taste that the Lord [is] gracious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men, indeed, having  been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a  spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual  sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: `Lo, I lay  in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is  believing on him may not be put to shame;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>to you, then, who are believing [is] the preciousness; and  to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of,  this one did become for the head of a corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are  stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also  they were set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>and ye [are] a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy  nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew  forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous  light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who [were] once not a people, and [are] now the people of  God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I call upon [you], as strangers and sojourners, to  keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that  which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works  having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the  Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for  punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing  good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to  silence the ignorance of the foolish men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the  evil, but as servants of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear  ye; the king honour ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the  masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the  cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>for this [is] gracious, if because of conscience toward God  any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>for what renown [is it], if sinning and being buffeted, ye  do endure [it]? but if, doing good and suffering [for it], ye  do endure, this [is] gracious with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer  for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his  steps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering --  was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is  judging righteously,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree,  that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may  live; by whose stripes ye were healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now  to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In like manner, the wives, be ye subject to your own  husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word,  through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they  may be won,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>having beheld your pure behaviour in fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of  plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or  of putting on of garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but -- the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of  great price,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were  adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him `sir,` of whom  ye did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any  terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with [them],  according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife  -- imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace  of life, that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling,  loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and  on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this ye were  called, that a blessing ye may inherit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>for `he who is willing to love life, and to see good days,  let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to  speak guile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek  peace and pursue it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>because the eyes of the Lord [are] upon the righteous, and  His ears -- to their supplication, and the face of the Lord  [is] upon those doing evil;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>and who [is] he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who  is good ye may become imitators?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>but if ye also should suffer because of righteousness,  happy [are ye]! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be  troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And [be] ready  always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account  concerning the hope that [is] in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak  against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are  traducing your good behaviour in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>for [it is] better doing good, if the will of God will it,  to suffer, than doing evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous  for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been  put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive  in the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did  preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of  God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in  which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>also to which an antitype doth now save us -- baptism, (not  a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a  good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of  Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven  -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been  subjected to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, ye also  with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in  the flesh hath done with sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>no more in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to  live the rest of the time in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>for sufficient to us [is] the past time of life the will of  the nations to have wrought, having walked in  lasciviousnesses, desires, excesses of wines, revelings,  drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>in which they think it strange -- your not running with them  to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge  living and dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>for for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that  they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and  may live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>And of all things the end hath come nigh; be sober-minded,  then, and watch unto the prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>and, before all things, to one another having the earnest  love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>hospitable to one another, without murmuring;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>each, according as he received a gift, to one another  ministering it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>if any one doth speak -- `as oracles of God;` if any one  doth minister -- `as of the ability which God doth supply;`  that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,  to whom is the glory and the power -- to the ages of the ages.  Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among  you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were  happening to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but, according as ye have fellowship with the sufferings of  the Christ, rejoice ye, that also in the revelation of his  glory ye may rejoice -- exulting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>if ye be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy [are  ye], because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you doth  rest; in regard, indeed, to them, he is evil-spoken of, and in  regard to you, he is glorified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or  evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men`s matters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him  glorify God in this respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment  from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of  those disobedient to the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and  sinner -- where shall he appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>so that also those suffering according to the will of god,  as to a stedfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in  good doing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>Elders who [are] among you, I exhort, who [am] a  fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ,  and of the glory about to be revealed a partaker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>feed the flock of God that [is] among you, overseeing not  constrainedly, but willingly, neither for filthy lucre, but of  a ready mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but  patterns becoming of the flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, ye shall  receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>In like manner, ye younger, be subject to elders, and all to  one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness  clothe yourselves, because God the proud doth resist, but to  the humble He doth give grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you  He may exalt in good time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>all your care having cast upon Him, because He careth for  you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a  roaring lion, doth walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same  sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be  accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>And the God of all grace, who did call you to His  age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little,  Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle  [you];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>to Him [is] the glory, and the power -- to the ages and the  ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon,  through few [words] I did write, exhorting and testifying this  to be the true grace of God in which ye have stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>Salute you doth the [assembly] in Babylon jointly elected,  and Markus my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all  who [are] in Christ Jesus! Amen.</verse>
