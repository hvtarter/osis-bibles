        <verse osisID='Song.1.2'>Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, For better [are]  thy loves than wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>For fragrance [are] thy perfumes good. Perfume emptied out  -- thy name, Therefore have virgins loved thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.4'>Draw me: after thee we run, The king hath brought me into  his inner chambers, We do joy and rejoice in thee, We mention  thy loves more than wine, Uprightly they have loved thee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>Dark [am] I, and comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As tents of  Kedar, as curtains of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Fear me not, because I [am] very dark, Because the sun hath  scorched me, The sons of my mother were angry with me, They  made me keeper of the vineyards, My vineyard -- my own -- I  have not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Declare to me, thou whom my soul hath loved, Where thou  delightest, Where thou liest down at noon, For why am I as one  veiled, By the ranks of thy companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If thou knowest not, O fair among women, Get thee forth by  the traces of the flock, And feed thy kids by the shepherds`  dwellings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.9'>To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared  thee, my friend,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.10'>Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands, Thy neck with  chains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.1.13'>A bundle of myrrh [is] my beloved to me, Between my breasts  it lodgeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.14'>A cluster of cypress [is] my beloved to me, In the  vineyards of En-Gedi!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.15'>Lo, thou [art] fair, my friend, Lo, thou [art] fair, thine  eyes [are] doves!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.4'>He hath brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner  over me [is] love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.5'>Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I  [am] sick with love.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.7'>I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or  by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till  she please!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.8'>The voice of my beloved! lo, this -- he is coming, Leaping  on the mountains, skipping on the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.9'>My beloved [is] like to a roe, Or to a young one of the  harts. Lo, this -- he is standing behind our wall, Looking from  the windows, Blooming from the lattice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.10'>My beloved hath answered and said to me, `Rise up, my  friend, my fair one, and come away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.11'>For lo, the winter hath passed by, The rain hath passed  away -- it hath gone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.13'>The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs, And the  sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my  friend, my fair one, yea, come away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the  ascent, Cause me to see thine appearance, Cause me to hear thy  voice, For thy voice [is] sweet, and thy appearance comely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Seize ye for us foxes, Little foxes -- destroyers of  vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his, Who is delighting  among the lilies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled  away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of  the harts, On the mountains of separation!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>But a little I passed on from them, Till I found him whom my  soul hath loved! I seized him, and let him not go, Till I  brought him in unto the house of my mother -- And the chamber  of her that conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or  by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till  she please!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.6'>Who [is] this coming up from the wilderness, Like palm-trees  of smoke, Perfumed [with] myrrh and frankincense, From every  powder of the merchant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.7'>Lo, his couch, that [is] Solomon`s, Sixty mighty ones [are]  around it, Of the mighty of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.8'>All of them holding sword, taught of battle, Each his sword  by his thigh, for fear at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.9'>A palanquin king Solomon made for himself, Of the wood of  Lebanon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.10'>Its pillars he made of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat  of purple, Its midst lined [with] love, By the daughters of  Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.11'>Go forth, and look, ye daughters of Zion, On king Solomon,  with the crown, With which his mother crowned him, In the day  of his espousals, And in the day of the joy of his heart!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Lo, thou [art] fair, my friend, lo, thou [art] fair, Thine  eyes [are] doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the  goats That have shone from mount Gilead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from  the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved  one is not among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>As a thread of scarlet [are] thy lips, And thy speech [is]  comely, As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind  thy veil,</verse>
