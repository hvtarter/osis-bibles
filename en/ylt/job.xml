      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>A man there hath been in the land of Uz -- Job his name --  and that man hath been perfect and upright -- both fearing God,  and turning aside from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there are borne to him seven sons and three daughters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>and his substance is seven thousand sheep, and three  thousand camels, and five hundred pairs of oxen, and five  hundred she-asses, and a service very abundant; and that man is  greater than any of the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons have gone and made a banquet -- the house of  each [in] his day -- and have sent and called to their three  sisters to eat and to drink with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>and it cometh to pass, when they have gone round the days of  the banquet, that Job doth send and sanctify them, and hath  risen early in the morning, and caused to ascend  burnt-offerings -- the number of them all -- for Job said,  `Perhaps my sons have sinned, yet blessed God in their heart.`  Thus doth Job all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>And the day is, that sons of God come in to station  themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary  in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence comest thou?`  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down on it.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart against My servant Job because there is none like him in  the land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God, and turning  aside from evil?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `For nought  is Job fearing God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not Thou made a hedge for him, and for his house, and  for all that he hath -- round about?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>The work of his hands Thou hast blessed, and his substance  hath spread in the land, and yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy  hand, and strike against anything that he hath -- if not: to  Thy face he doth bless Thee!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, all that he hath  [is] in thy hand, only unto him put not forth thy hand.` And  the Adversary goeth out from the presence of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And the day is, that his sons and his daughters are eating,  and drinking wine, in the house of their brother, the  first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And a messenger hath come in unto Job and saith, `The oxen  have been plowing, and the she-asses feeding by their sides,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and Sheba doth fall, and take them, and the young men they  have smitten by the mouth of the sword, and I am escaped --  only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Fire of God hath fallen from the heavens, and burneth  among the flock, and among the young men, and consumeth them,  and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Chaldeans made three heads, and rush on the camels, and  take them, and the young men they have smitten by the mouth of  the sword, and I am escaped -- only I alone -- to declare [it]  to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While this [one] is speaking another also hath come and  saith, `Thy sons and thy daughters are eating, and drinking  wine, in the house of their brother, the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And lo, a great wind hath come from over the wilderness,  and striketh against the four corners of the house, and it  falleth on the young men, and they are dead, and I am escaped  -- only I alone -- to declare [it] to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>And Job riseth, and rendeth his robe, and shaveth his head,  and falleth to the earth, and doth obeisance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and he saith, `Naked came I forth from the womb of my  mother, and naked I turn back thither: Jehovah hath given and  Jehovah hath taken: let the name of Jehovah be blessed.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job hath not sinned, nor given folly to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And the day is, that sons of God come in to station  themselves by Jehovah, and there doth come also the Adversary  in their midst to station himself by Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Whence camest thou?`  And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `From going to  and fro in the land, and from walking up and down in it.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Hast thou set thy  heart unto My servant Job because there is none like him in the  land, a man perfect and upright, fearing God and turning aside  from evil? and still he is keeping hold on his integrity, and  thou dost move Me against him to swallow him up for nought!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And the Adversary answereth Jehovah and saith, `A skin for a  skin, and all that a man hath he doth give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>Yet, put forth, I pray Thee, Thy hand, and strike unto his  bone and unto his flesh -- if not: unto Thy face he doth bless  Thee!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary, `Lo, he [is] in thy  hand; only his life take care of.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>And the Adversary goeth forth from the presence of Jehovah,  and smiteth Job with a sore ulcer from the sole of his foot  unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he taketh to him a potsherd to scrape himself with it,  and he is sitting in the midst of the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And his wife saith to him, `Still thou art keeping hold on  thine integrity: bless God and die.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>And he saith unto her, `As one of the foolish women  speaketh, thou speakest; yea, the good we receive from God, and  the evil we do not receive.` In all this Job hath not sinned  with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>And three of the friends of Job hear of all this evil that  hath come upon him, and they come in each from his place --  Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the  Naamathite -- and they are met together to come in to bemoan  him, and to comfort him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>and they lift up their eyes from afar and have not  discerned him, and they lift up their voice and weep, and rend  each his robe, and sprinkle dust on their heads -- heavenward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sit with him on the earth seven days and seven  nights, and there is none speaking unto him a word when they  have seen that the pain hath been very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answereth and saith: --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that  hath said: `A man-child hath been conceived.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>That day -- let it be darkness, Let not God require it from  above, Nor let light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud  tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of  days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>That night -- let thick darkness take it, Let it not be  united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it  not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo! that night -- let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into  it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up  Leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for  light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of  the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was  mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come  forth and gasp!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Wherefore have knees been before me? And what [are] breasts,  that I suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept --  then there is rest to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes  for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes -- they have gold, They are filling their  houses [with] silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>(Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants -- they have  not seen light.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do  the wearied in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard  the voice of an exactor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>Small and great [are] there the same. And a servant [is]  free from his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the  bitter soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it  above hid treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who are glad -- unto joy, They rejoice when they find a  grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut  up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as  waters [are] my roarings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was  afraid of doth come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not safe -- nor was I quiet -- Nor was I at rest --  and trouble cometh!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to  keep in words who is able?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest  strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees  thou dost strengthen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It  striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the  perfection of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished?  And where have the upright been cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of  misery, reap it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of  His anger consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And  teeth of young lions have been broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of  the lioness do separate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth  mine ear a little of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of  deep sleep on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my  bones caused to fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the  hair of my flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude  [is] over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>`Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a  man cleaner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His  messengers setteth praise.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose  foundation [is] in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any  regarding, for ever they perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die,  and not in wisdom!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of  the holy ones dost thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to  death the simple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I -- I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his  habitation straightway,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the  gate, And there is no deliverer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns  taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the  ground springeth up misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>Yet I -- I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful,  till there is no numbering.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And  the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His  hands heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil  striketh not on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle  from the hands of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not  afraid of destruction, When it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast  of the earth, Thou art not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>(For with sons of the field [is] thy covenant, And the  beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou hast known that thy tent [is] peace, And inspected  thy habitation, and errest not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>And hast known that numerous [is] Thy seed, And thine  offspring as the herb of the earth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore  my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For arrows of the Mighty [are] with me, Whose poison is  drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves [for]  me!</verse>
