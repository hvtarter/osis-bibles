        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and  to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying  of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of  my children in truth walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work  to the brethren and to the strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou  wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because for [His] name they went forth, nothing receiving  from the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may  become to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first  place among them -- Diotrephes -- doth not receive us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to  remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating  against us; and not content with these, neither doth he  himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth   forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that  which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who  is doing evil hath not seen God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the  truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and ye have known  that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink  and pen to write to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we  shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be  saluting the friends by name.</verse>
