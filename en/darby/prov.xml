        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy voice to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>[from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart observe my commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>for length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they add to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not loving-kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>and thou shalt find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not unto thine own intelligence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make plain thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>it shall be health for thy navel, and moisture for thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honour Jehovah with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the instruction of Jehovah, neither be weary of his chastisement;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>for whom Jehovah loveth he chasteneth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gain thereof is better than the gain of silver, and her revenue than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not equal unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand riches and honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is he that retaineth her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the deeps were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>when thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, but thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>for Jehovah shall be thy confidence, and he will keep thy foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; but his secret is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>He indeed scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of the foolish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>for I give you good doctrine: forsake ye not my law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I will teach thee in the way of wisdom, I will lead thee in paths of uprightness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they sleep not except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken away unless they have caused [some] to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is as the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.</verse>
