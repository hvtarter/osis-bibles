  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it has seemed good to *me* also, accurately acquainted from the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias was troubled, seeing [him], and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy supplication has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before [the] Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with [the] Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [the] Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And *he* shall go before him in [the] spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to [the] thoughts of just [men], to make ready for [the] Lord a prepared people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for *I* am an old man, and my wife advanced in years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering, said to him, *I* am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad tidings to thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were awaiting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delaying in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and continued dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus has [the] Lord done to me in [these] days in which he looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee, of which [the] name [was] Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [was] Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, [thou] favoured one! the Lord [is] with thee: [blessed art *thou* amongst women].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she, [seeing] [the angel], was troubled at his word, and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of [the] Highest; and [the] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answering said to her, [The] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of [the] Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>for nothing shall be impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of [the] Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art] *thou* amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed [is] she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy [is] his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>and his mercy [is] to generations and generations to them that fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty [ones] in the thought of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(as he spoke to our fathers,) to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [the] Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answering said, No; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And having asked for a writing-table, he wrote saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them; and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? And [the] Lord's hand was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And Zacharias his father was filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be [the] Lord the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as he spoke by [the] mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>[the] oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in piety and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And *thou*, child, shalt be called [the] prophet of [the] Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of [the] Lord to make ready his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [the] remission of their sins</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>on account of [the] bowels of mercy of our God; wherein [the] dayspring from on high has visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in [the] shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>But it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census should be made of all the habitable world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the government of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be inscribed in the census roll, each to his own city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city Nazareth to Judaea, to David's city, the which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be inscribed in the census roll with Mary who was betrothed to him [as his] wife, she being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it came to pass, while they were there, the days of her giving birth [to her child] were fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in that country abiding without, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And lo, an angel of [the] Lord was there by them, and [the] glory of [the] Lord shone around them, and they feared [with] great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for to-day a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, as the angels departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>and having seen [it] they made known about the country the thing which had been said to them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard [it] wondered at the things said to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things [in her mind], pondering [them] in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was the name given by the angel before he had been conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days were fulfilled for their purifying according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present [him] to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of [the] Lord: Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of [the] Lord: A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and [the] Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see [the] Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>*he* received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation of [the] Gentiles and [the] glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and mother wondered at the things which were said concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Lo, this [child] is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(and even a sword shall go through thine own soul;) so that [the] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of [the] tribe of Asher, who was far advanced in years, having lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and herself a widow up to eighty-four years; who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had completed all things according to the law of [the] Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew and waxed strong [in spirit], filled with wisdom, and God's grace was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, and they went up [to Jerusalem] according to the custom of the feast</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and had completed the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew not [of it];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but, supposing him to be in the company that journeyed together, they went a day's journey, and sought him among their relations and acquaintances:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Child, why hast thou dealt thus with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, Why [is it] that ye have sought me? did ye not know that I ought to be [occupied] in my Father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the thing that he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch of Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, [the] word of God came upon John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the district round the Jordan, preaching [the] baptism of repentance for [the] remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in [the] book of [the] words of Esaias the prophet: Voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every gorge shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked [places] shall become a straight [path], and the rough places smooth ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said therefore to the crowds which went out to be baptised by him, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Produce therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and begin not to say in yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father, for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And already also the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into [the] fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the crowds asked him saying, What should we do then?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>And it came to pass, as the crowd pressed on him to hear the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen, having come down from them, were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And getting into one of the ships, which was Simon's, he asked him to draw out a little from the land; and he sat down and taught the crowds out of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>But when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Draw out into the deep [water] and let down your nets for a haul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answering said to him, Master, having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing, but at thy word I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes. And their net broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship to come and help them, and they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But Simon Peter, seeing it, fell at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For astonishment had laid hold on him, and on all those who were with him, at the haul of fishes which they had taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and in like manner also on James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; henceforth thou shalt be catching men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And having run the ships on shore, leaving all they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass as he was in one of the cities, that behold, there was a man full of leprosy, and seeing Jesus, falling upon his face, he besought him saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou art able to cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And stretching forth his hand he touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he enjoined him to tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report concerning him was spread abroad still more, and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed from their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And *he* withdrew himself, and was about in the desert [places] and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* was teaching, and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [out of] Jerusalem; and [the] Lord's power was [there] to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And lo, men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed; and they sought to bring him in, and put [him] before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And not finding what way to bring him in, on account of the crowd, going up on the housetop they let him down through the tiles, with his little couch, into the midst before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason [in their minds], saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus, knowing their reasonings, answering said to them, Why reason ye in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralysed man, I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy little couch and go to thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately standing up before them, having taken up that whereon he was laid, he departed to his house, glorifying God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And having left all, rising up, he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house, and there was a great crowd of tax-gatherers and others who were at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured at his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with tax-gatherers and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answering said to them, They that are in sound health have not need of a physician, but those that are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am not come to call righteous [persons], but sinful [ones] to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications, in like manner those also of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And he said to them, Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But days will come when also the bridegroom will have been taken away from them; then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he spoke also a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment, otherwise he will both rend the new, and the piece which is from the new will not suit with the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old skins, otherwise the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>but new wine is to be put into new skins, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one having drunk old wine [straightway] wishes for new, for he says, The old is better.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jesus went with them. But already, when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterwards that *he* went through [the country] city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve [were] with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And a great crowd coming together, and those who were coming to him out of each city, he spoke by parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the way, and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>and other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it was dried up because it had not moisture;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>and other fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns having sprung up with [it] choked it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>and other fell into the good ground, and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him [saying], What may this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>But the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>But those by the wayside are those who hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>But those upon the rock, those who when they hear receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>But that that fell where the thorns were, these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that in the good ground, these are they who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* entered into a ship, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side of the lake; and they set off from shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>And as they sailed, he fell asleep; and a sudden squall of wind came down on the lake, and they were filled [with water], and were in danger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>and coming to [him] they woke him up, saying, Master, master, we perish. But he, rising up, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, Where is your faith? And, being afraid, they were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And as he got out [of the ship] on the land, a certain man out of the city met him, who had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, and did not abide in a house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>But seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the man. For very often it had seized him; and he had been bound, kept with chains and fetters; and breaking the bonds he was driven by the demon into the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus asked him saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: for many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought him that he would not command them to go away into the bottomless pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into those; and he suffered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And the demons, going out from the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake, and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>But they that fed [them], seeing what had happened, fled, and told [it] to the city and to the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were possessed with great fear; and *he*, entering into the ship, returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee. And he went away through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>And it came to pass when Jesus returned, the crowd received him gladly, for they were all expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, a man came, whose name was Jairus, and he was [a] ruler of the synagogue, and falling at the feet of Jesus besought him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as he went the crowds thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who had a flux of blood since twelve years, who, having spent all her living on physicians, could not be cured by any one,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, Who has touched me? But all denying, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds close thee in and press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus, hearing it, answered him saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God. And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he said to his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not receive him, because his face was [turned as] going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And his disciples James and John seeing [it] said, Lord, wilt thou that we speak [that] fire come down from heaven and consume them, as also Elias did?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass as they went in the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me to go first and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But Jesus said to him, Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, but do *thou* go and announce the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, No one having laid his hand on [the] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>and there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adverse party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>And he would not for a time; but afterwards he said within himself, If even I fear not God and respect not man,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when he came up to the place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for to-day I must remain in thy house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>for behold, days are coming in which they will say, Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and breasts that have not given suck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a just</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself also,] for the kingdom of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it, that behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, Why seek ye the living one among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you, being yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and rise the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now it was Mary of Magdala, and Johanna, and Mary the [mother] of James, and the others with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale, and they disbelieved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>but their eyes were holden so as not to know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him, Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and, not having found his body, came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the scriptures to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took it and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.</verse>
