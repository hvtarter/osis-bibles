      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and abstained from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his substance was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and this man was greater than all the children of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of the feasting were gone about, that Job sent and hallowed them; and he rose up early in the morning, and offered up burnt-offerings [according to] the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is spread abroad in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and behold, there came a great wind from over the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Jehovah said to Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil? and still he remaineth firm in his integrity, though thou movedst me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>but put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah; and he smote Job with a grievous botch from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And his wife said to him, Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity? curse God and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>And three friends of Job heard of all this evil that was come upon him. And they came each one from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept. And they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights; and none spoke a word to him; for they saw that [his] anguish was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>That day let it be darkness, let not God care for it from above, neither let light shine upon it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>That night let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Wherefore did I not die from the womb, come forth from the belly and expire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees meet me? and wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate places for themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the wearied are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and life to those bitter of soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To the man whose way is hidden, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For I feared a fear, and it hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I was not in safety, neither had I quietness, neither was I at rest, and trouble came.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If a word were essayed to thee, wouldest thou be grieved? But who can refrain from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling, and thou hast braced up the bending knees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it is come upon thee, and thou grievest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection of thy ways thy hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished? and where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>Even as I have seen, they that plough iniquity and sow mischief, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear received a whisper thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to shake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof: a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall [mortal] man be more just than God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he chargeth with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed as the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>From morning to evening are they smitten: without any heeding it, they perish for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent-cord torn away in them? they die, and without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call, I pray thee! Is there any that answereth thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I myself saw the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, and there is no deliverer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh even out of the thorns; and the snare gapeth for his substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For evil cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>For man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me I will seek unto God, and unto God commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain on the face of the earth, and sendeth waters on the face of the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>Setting up on high those that are low; and mourners are exalted to prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, and their hands carry not out the enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in a the daytime, and grope at midday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>And he saveth the needy from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor hath what he hopeth for, and unrighteousness stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver thee in six troubles, and in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue; and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, and of the beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou wilt survey thy fold, and miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thine offspring as the herb of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come to the grave in a ripe age, as a shock of corn is brought in in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thyself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>And Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words are vehement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, their poison drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray by the grass? loweth an ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>What my soul refuseth to touch, that is as my loathsome food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request, and that God would grant my desire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>And that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>Then should I yet have comfort; and in the pain which spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should have patience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is it not that there is no help in me, and soundness is driven away from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>For him that is fainting kindness [is meet] from his friend; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream, as the channel of streams which pass away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are turbid by reason of the ice, in which the snow hideth itself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>At the time they diminish, they are dried up; when heat affecteth them, they vanish from their place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>They wind about in the paths of their course, they go off into the waste and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba counted on them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They are ashamed at their hope; they come thither, and are confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>So now ye are nothing; ye see a terrible object and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Bring unto me, and make me a present from your substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, rescue me from the hand of the oppressor, and redeem me from the hand of the violent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are right words! but what doth your upbraiding reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye imagine to reprove words? The speeches of one that is desperate are indeed for the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and dig [a pit] for your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore if ye will, look upon me; and it shall be to your face if I lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let there be no wrong; yea, return again, my righteousness shall be in it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling expecteth his wages,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.14'>Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.15'>The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.16'>One is so near to another that no air can come between them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.17'>They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together, and cannot be sundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot and cauldron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>In his neck lodgeth strength, and terror danceth before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are fused upon him, they cannot be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>His heart is firm as a stone, yea, firm as the nether [millstone].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.25'>When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.26'>If any reach him with a sword, it cannot hold; neither spear, nor dart, nor harpoon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.28'>The arrow will not make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.29'>Clubs are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.30'>His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.31'>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.32'>He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>And Job answered Jehovah and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou canst do everything, and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered what I did not understand; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and inform me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Wherefore I abhor [myself], and repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it came to pass after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>And now, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept: lest I deal with you [after your] folly, for ye have not spoken of me rightly, like my servant Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did according as Jehovah had said unto them; and Jehovah accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he had prayed for his friends; and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>And all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house, and they condoled with him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him; and every one gave him a piece of money, and every one a golden ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>And he had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found [so] fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And Job lived after this a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>And Job died, old and full of days.</verse>
