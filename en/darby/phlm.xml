      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which [is] in thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, always making mention of thee at my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>in such sort that thy participation in the faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in us towards Christ [Jesus].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>for love's sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I exhort thee for *my* child, whom I have begotten in [my] bonds, Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>whom I have sent back to thee: [but do *thou* receive] him, that is, *my* bowels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>whom *I* was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in [the] flesh and in [the] Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee], receive him as me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [to thee], put this to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>*I* Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; *I* will repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, *I* would have profit of *thee* in [the] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.</verse>
