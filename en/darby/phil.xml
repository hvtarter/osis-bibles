  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the] overseers and ministers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the] bowels of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which [is] by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for good will, preach the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If then [there be] any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any bowels and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>[let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in [the] likeness of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and [that the] death of [the] cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal [beings],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord to God [the] Father's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to [his] good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmurings and reasonings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in [the] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again rejoice, and that *I* might be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in [the] Lord: to write the same things to you, to me [is] not irksome, and for you safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by [the] Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Though *I* have [my] trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, *I* rather:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of [the] race of Israel, of [the] tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to [the] law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which [is] in [the] law, found blameless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which [is] of God through faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [the] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained [the prize], or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession [of it], seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ [Jesus].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, *I* do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I pursue, [looking] towards [the] goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>As many therefore as [are] perfect, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>But whereto we have attained, [let us] walk in the same steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Be imitators [all] together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>(for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they [are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and [their] glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>for *our* commonwealth has its existence in [the] heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of [the] power which he has even to subdue all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in [the] Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord [is] near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true, whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I* have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save *ye* alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are] with me salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
