      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>And king David was old [and] advanced in age; and they covered him with clothes, but he obtained no warmth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>And his servants said to him, Let there be found for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>And they sought for a fair damsel throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was very fair; and cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he provided himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not grieved him at any time in saying, Why doest thou so? and he was also a very comely man; and [his mother] bore him after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they helped Adonijah and followed [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men whom David had, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not invite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith is king, and David our lord does not know [it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>And now, come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee and confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid, [saying,] Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant has he not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he is gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, [even] me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewn to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, [As] Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>even as I swore to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>And ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall reign in my stead, and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>And Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard [it] as they were finishing their repast; and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and he said, Wherefore this noise of the city in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said [to him], Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Indeed, our lord king David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon is sitting on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon more excellent than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne! And the king bowed himself on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king: Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all Adonijah's guests were afraid, and rose up and went every man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose and went and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for behold, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he be a worthy man, there shall not one of his hairs fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>And king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>And the days of David were at hand that he should die; and he enjoined Solomon his son saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the way of all the earth: be of good courage therefore, and be a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>that Jehovah may confirm his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said he, a man upon the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>And thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and upon his sandals that were on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>And thou shalt do according to thy wisdom, and not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But shew kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came up to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day that I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>And now hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and thou shalt know what thou oughtest to do to him; but bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>And he said, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign; but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of thee; refuse me not. And she said to him, Speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king for he will not refuse thee that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>And Bathsheba went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne; and he caused a throne to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; refuse me not. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>And king Solomon swore by Jehovah saying, God do so to me, and more also, Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>And now [as] Jehovah liveth, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who fell on him, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of Adonai Jehovah before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the report came to Joab (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom); and Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, he is by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him, Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said, No; for I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; and take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he shed upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, without my father David's knowledge: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>And their blood shall be requited upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him, and put him to death; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and abide there, and go not forth thence anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>And it shall be that on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the torrent of Kidron, know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shimei's ran away to Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>Then Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee swear by Jehovah, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest forth, and walkest abroad anywhere, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I charged thee with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>And the king said to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father; and Jehovah returns thy wickedness upon thine own head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>and king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out and fell upon him, and he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon allied himself by marriage with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had ended building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only, the people sacrificed on the high places; for there was no house built to the name of Jehovah, until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father; only, he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer up upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, Thou hast shewn unto thy servant David my father great loving-kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great loving-kindness, that thou hast given him a son who sits upon his throne, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child: I know not to go out and to come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, to discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy numerous people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself discernment to understand judgment;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.1'>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.2'>And Elijah went to shew himself to Ahab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.3'>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the steward of his house (now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.4'>and it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and maintained them with bread and water);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.5'>and Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the fountains of water and to all the torrents, perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and the mules alive, so that we may not have to destroy some of [our] beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.6'>And they divided the land between them to pass through it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.7'>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him; and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it indeed thou, my lord Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.8'>And he said to him, I [am he]: go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.9'>And he said, What have I sinned, that thou givest thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to put me to death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.10'>As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord has not sent to seek thee; and when they said, He is not [here], he took an oath of the kingdom or nation that they found thee not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.11'>And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.12'>And it shall come to pass when I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah shall carry thee whither I know not; and when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will kill me; and I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.13'>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah's prophets by fifty in a cave, and maintained them with bread and water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.14'>And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah! and he will kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.15'>And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will certainly shew myself to him to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.16'>Then Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.17'>And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is it thou, the troubler of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.18'>And he said, I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.19'>And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.20'>So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.21'>Then Elijah drew near to all the people, and said, How long do ye halt between two opinions? if Jehovah be God, follow him; and if Baal, follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.22'>And Elijah said to the people, I, only I, remain a prophet of Jehovah; and Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.23'>Let them therefore give us two bullocks: and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and put it on the wood, and put no fire; and I will sacrifice the other bullock, and put it on the wood, and put no fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.24'>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the god that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, The word is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.25'>And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bullock for yourselves, and sacrifice it first; for ye are the many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.26'>And they took the bullock which had been given them, and sacrificed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! But there was no voice, and none answered. And they leaped about the altar that had been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.27'>And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god; for he is meditating, or gone aside, or he is on a journey; perhaps he sleeps, and will awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.28'>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with swords and spears, till the blood gushed out upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.29'>And it came to pass when midday was past, that they prophesied until the [time] of the offering up of the oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any that answered, nor any attention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.30'>Then Elijah said to all the people, Draw near to me. And all the people drew near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah which was broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.31'>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Jehovah came saying, Israel shall be thy name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.32'>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah, and made a trench round about the altar, of the capacity of two measures of seed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.33'>and he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four pitchers with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.34'>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.35'>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.36'>And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering up of the oblation, that Elijah the prophet drew near, and said, Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things by thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.37'>Answer me, Jehovah, answer me, that this people may know that thou Jehovah art God, and [that] *thou* hast turned their heart back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.38'>And the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.39'>And all the people saw [it], and they fell on their faces and said, Jehovah, he is God! Jehovah, he is God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.40'>And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape! And they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the torrent of Kishon, and slaughtered them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.41'>And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.42'>And Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed down on the earth, and put his face between his knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.43'>And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.44'>And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said, Behold there is a cloud, small as a man's hand, arising out of the sea. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Harness and go down, that the pour of rain stop thee not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.45'>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heavens became black [with] clouds and wind, and there was a great pour of rain. And Ahab got on the chariot, and went to Jizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.18.46'>And the hand of Jehovah was upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jizreel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.19'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.1'>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and in detail how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.2'>And Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, So do the gods [to me], and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.3'>And when he saw [that], he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.4'>And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a certain broom-bush, and requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough: now, Jehovah, take my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.5'>And he lay down and slept under the broom-bush. And behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise, eat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.6'>And he looked, and behold, at his head was a cake, baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.7'>And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; for the journey is too great for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.8'>And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.9'>And there he went into a cave, and lodged there. And behold, the word of Jehovah [came] to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.10'>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.11'>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah: Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake: Jehovah was not in the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.12'>And after the earthquake, a fire: Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire, a soft gentle voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.13'>And it came to pass, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice [came] to him and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.14'>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.15'>And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Hazael king over Syria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.16'>and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint prophet in thy stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.17'>And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.18'>Yet I have left [myself] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.19'>And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing [with] twelve yokes before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah went over to him, and cast his mantle on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.20'>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.19.21'>And he returned back from him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. And he arose and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.1'>And Ben-Hadad king of Syria assembled all his host; and there were thirty-two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.2'>And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus says Ben-Hadad:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.3'>Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, the goodliest, are mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.4'>And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.5'>And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-Hadad saying: I sent to thee indeed, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.6'>but to-morrow about this time I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thy sight, they shall put in their hand and take away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.7'>And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this [man] seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.8'>And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not, nor consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.9'>And he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.10'>And Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.11'>And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell [him], Let not him that girdeth on boast himself as he that putteth off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.12'>And it came to pass when he heard this word, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the tents, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves. And they set themselves against the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.13'>And behold, a prophet drew near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.14'>And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he said, Thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.15'>And he numbered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.16'>And they went out at noon; and Ben-Hadad drank himself drunk in the tents, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings that helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.17'>And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-Hadad sent out, and they told him saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.18'>And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.19'>And these servants of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.20'>And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.21'>And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.22'>And the prophet drew near to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and understand, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.23'>And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the mountains; therefore they were stronger than we; but if we fight against them on the plateau, shall we not be stronger than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.24'>And do this: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their stead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.25'>and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them on the plateau: shall we not be stronger than they? And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.26'>And it came to pass, at the return of the year, that Ben-Hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.27'>And the children of Israel were numbered and victualled, and they went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats; but the Syrians filled the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.28'>And the man of God drew near, and spoke to the king of Israel and said, Thus saith Jehovah: Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the mountains, but he is not a god of the valleys, I will give all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.29'>And they encamped one over against the other seven days; and it came to pass that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.30'>And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men of them that were left. And Ben-Hadad fled, and came into the city, [from] chamber to chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.31'>And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.32'>And they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-Hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.33'>And the men took it as a good omen, and hastened to catch what came from him, and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad. And he said, Go, bring him. And Ben-Hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.34'>And [Ben-Hadad] said to him, The cities that my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I [said Ahab] will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.35'>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. But the man refused to smite him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.39'>And as the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me and said, Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.40'>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So [is] thy judgment: thyself hast decided [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.20.41'>Then he hastily took the sash away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him, that he was of the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.1'>And it came to pass after these things, [that] Naboth the Jizreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jizreel, by the side of the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.11'>And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles that dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letter that she had sent to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.12'>they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.13'>And there came the two men, sons of Belial, and sat before him; and the men of Belial witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. And they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>And they sent to Jezebel saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, mine enemy? And he said, I have found [thee]; because thou hast sold thyself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jezebel also spoke Jehovah saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the moat of Jizreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>(Surely there was none like to Ahab, who did sell himself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, Jezebel his wife urging him on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass when Ahab heard these words, that he rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>
