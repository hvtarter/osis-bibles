        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to [the] elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God [the] Father, and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from [the] beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into [the] house, and greet him not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thine elect sister greet thee.</verse>
