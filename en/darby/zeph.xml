      <chapter osisID='Zeph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.1'>The word of Jehovah that came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.2'>I will utterly take away everything from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.3'>I will take away man and beast; I will take away the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked, and I will cut off mankind from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>And I will stretch forth my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the name of the Chemarim with the priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>and them that bow down to the host of the heavens upon the housetops; and them that bow down to Jehovah, that swear by [him], and swear by Malcham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>and them that turn back from after Jehovah, and that do not seek Jehovah, nor inquire for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Be silent at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand; for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath hallowed his guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah's sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>And in that day will I punish all those that leap over the threshold, who fill their master's house with violence and deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish-gate, and a howling from the second [quarter], and a great crashing from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are cut down, all they that are laden with silver are cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation; and they shall build houses, and not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and not drink the wine thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly. The voice of the day of Jehovah: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities and against the high battlements.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like blind men; for they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.18'>their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them, in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for a full end, yea, a sudden [end], shall he make of all them that dwell in the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Collect yourselves and gather together, O nation without shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass away as chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah's anger come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek Jehovah, all ye meek of the land, who have performed his ordinance; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah's anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For Gazah shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon shall be a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.6'>and the sea-coast shall be cave-dwellings for shepherds, and folds for flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall visit them, and turn again their captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>Therefore, [as] I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall certainly be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation; the remnant of my people shall spoil them, and the residue of my nation shall possess them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and all the isles of the nations shall worship him, every one from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be the slain of my sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, a place of drought like the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.14'>And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the crowd of beasts; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the chapiters thereof; a voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be on the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a couching-place for beasts! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, shall wave his hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zeph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Woe to her that is rebellious and corrupted, to the oppressing city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She hearkened not to the voice; she received not correction; she confided not in Jehovah; she drew not near her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, that leave nothing for the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets are vain-glorious, treacherous persons; her priests profane the sanctuary, they do violence to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>The righteous Jehovah is in the midst of her: he doeth no wrong. Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light; it faileth not: but the unrighteous knoweth no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>I have cut off nations: their battlements are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>I said, Only fear me, receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, howsoever I may punish her. But they rose early, they corrupted all their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.8'>Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to assemble the nations, that I may gather the kingdoms together, to pour upon them mine indignation, all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.10'>From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.11'>In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that exult in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.12'>And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.13'>The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: but *they* shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.14'>Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.15'>Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.16'>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear not; Zion, let not thy hands be slack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.17'>Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a mighty one that will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.18'>I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies, who were of thee: the reproach of it was a burden [unto them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.19'>Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that halted, and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the lands where they have been put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.20'>At that time will I bring you, yea, at the time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn again your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.</verse>
