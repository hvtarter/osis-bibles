        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight is in Jehovah's law, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he [is] as a tree planted by brooks of water, which giveth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf fadeth not; and all that he doeth prospereth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his fierce displeasure will he terrify them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth a man of blood and deceit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness, because of my foes; make thy way plain before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no certainty in their mouth; their inward part is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
