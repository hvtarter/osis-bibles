      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, because your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves make our boast in you in the assemblies of God for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, which ye are sustaining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, to the end that ye should be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the sake of which ye also suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>if at least [it is a] righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to you that are troubled repose with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with [the] angels of his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>who shall pay the penalty [of] everlasting destruction from [the] presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed, (for our testimony to you has been believed,) in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and fulfil all [the] good pleasure of [his] goodness and [the] work of faith with power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>so that the name of our Lord Jesus [Christ] may be glorified in you and *ye* in him, according to the grace of our God, and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as [if it were] by us, as that the day of the Lord is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because [it will not be] unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these things to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only [there is] he who restrains now until he be gone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>And for this reason God sends to them a working of error, that they should believe what is false,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that all might be judged who have not believed the truth, but have found pleasure in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of [the] Lord, that God has chosen you from [the] beginning to salvation in sanctification of [the] Spirit and belief of [the] truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>whereto he has called you by our glad tidings, to [the] obtaining of [the] glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given [us] eternal consolation and good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be delivered from bad and evil men, for faith [is] not [the portion] of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and keep [you] from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>But we trust in the Lord as to you, that the things which we enjoin, ye both do and will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because we have not walked disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>not that we have not the right, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For also when we were with you we enjoined you this, that if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that [there are] some walking among you disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now such we enjoin and exhort in [the] Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly they eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But *ye*, brethren, do not faint in well-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>But if any one obey not our word by the letter, mark that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>But the Lord of peace himself give you peace continually in every way. The Lord [be] with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is [the] mark in every letter; so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.</verse>
