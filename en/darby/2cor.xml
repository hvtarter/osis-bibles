  <div type='book' osisID='2Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and the brother Timotheus, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who encourages us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever, through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>Because, even as the sufferings of the Christ abound towards us, so through the Christ does our encouragement also abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But whether we are in tribulation, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation, wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which *we* also suffer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>(and our hope for you [is] sure;) or whether we are encouraged, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation: knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond [our] power, so as to despair even of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we do not write other things to you but what ye well know and recognise; and I hope that ye will recognise to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as *ye* [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously, that ye might have a second favour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and to pass through to Macedonia by you, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be set forward by you to Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Having therefore this purpose, did I then use lightness? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to flesh, that there should be with me yea yea, and nay nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>Now God [is] faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For whatever promises of God [there are], in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, [is] God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we rule over your faith, but are fellow-workmen of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I have judged this with myself, not to come back to you in grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if *I* grieve you, who also [is] it that gladdens me, if not he that is grieved through me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I have written this very [letter] [to you], that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy; trusting in you all that my joy is [that] of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge [you]) all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of [your] love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>But to whom ye forgive anything, *I* also; for I also, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, [it is] for your sakes in [the] person of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas for the [publication of the] glad tidings of the Christ, a door also being opened to me in [the] Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother; but bidding them adieu, I came away to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But thanks [be] to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who [is] sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or [commendatory] from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>*Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but [the] Spirit of [the] living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of [the] heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency [is] of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>(But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, [a glory] which is annulled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation [be] glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For also that [which was] glorified is not glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that annulled [was introduced] with glory, much rather that which abides [subsists] in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not according as Moses put a veil on his own face, so that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that annulled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their thoughts have been darkened, for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant, unremoved, which in Christ is annulled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But when it shall turn to [the] Lord, the veil is taken away.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of [the] Lord [is, there is] liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by [the] Lord [the] Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is [the] image of God, should not shine forth [for them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Because [it is] the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in [the] face of [Jesus] Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>so that death works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; *we* also believe, therefore also we speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things [are] for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary [and] light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen [are] for a time, but those that are not seen eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which [is] from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that [what is] mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he that has wrought us for this very thing [is] God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore [we are] always confident, and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(for we walk by faith, not by sight;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to those he has done, whether [it be] good or evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>[For] we do not again commend ourselves to you, but [we are] giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf, that ye may have [such] with those boasting in countenance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For whether we are beside ourselves, [it is] to God; or are sober, [it is] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know [him thus] no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>So if any one [be] in Christ, [there is] a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>and all things [are] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [Jesus] Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>how that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences; and putting in us the word of that reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We are ambassadors therefore for Christ, God as [it were] beseeching by us, we entreat for Christ, Be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that *we* might become God's righteousness in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>But [as] fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now [is the] well-accepted time; behold, now [the] day of salvation:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in [the] Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let *your* heart also expand itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation [is there] between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>and what agreement of God's temple with idols? for *ye* are [the] living God's temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith [the] Lord, and touch not [what is] unclean, and *I* will receive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith [the] Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God's fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us: we have injured no one, we have ruined no one, we have made gain of no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not speak for condemnation, for I have already said that ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great [is] my boldness towards you, great my exulting in respect of you; I am filled with encouragement; I overabound in joy under all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For indeed, when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but [we were] afflicted in every way; without combats, within fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But he who encourages those that are [brought] low, [even] God, encouraged us by the coming of Titus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I the more rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For if also I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret [it], if even I have regretted it; for I see that that letter, if even [it were] only for a time, grieved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that ye have been grieved, but that ye have been grieved to repentance; for ye have been grieved according to God, that in nothing ye might be injured by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For grief according to God works repentance to salvation, never to be regretted; but the grief of the world works death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in *you*, but [what] excusing [of yourselves], but [what] indignation, but [what] fear, but [what] ardent desire, but [what] zeal, but [what] vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>So then, if also I wrote to you, [it was] not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this reason we have been encouraged. And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because if I boasted to him anything about you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth, so also our boasting to Titus has been [the] truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>and his affections are more abundantly towards you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their [free-hearted] liberality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For according to [their] power, I bear witness, and beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of their own accord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>begging of us with much entreaty [to give effect to] the grace and fellowship of the service which [was to be rendered] to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So that we begged Titus that, according as he had before begun, so he would also complete as to you this grace also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>but even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in love from you to us, that ye may abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And I give [my] opinion in this, for this is profitable for you who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now also complete the doing of it; so that as [there was] the readiness to be willing, so also to complete out of what ye have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if the readiness be there, [a man is] accepted according to what he may have, not according to what he has not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For [it is] not in order that there may be ease for others, and for you distress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but [on the principle] of equality; in the present time your abundance for their lack, that their abundance may be for your lack, so that there should be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>According as it is written, He who [gathered] much had no excess, and he who [gathered] little was nothing short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only [so], but [is] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and [a witness of] our readiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>avoiding this, that any one should blame us in this abundance [which is] administered by us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>for we provide for things honest, not only before [the] Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence [he has] as to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>Whether as regards Titus, [he is] my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, [they are] deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Shew therefore to them, before the assemblies, the proof of your love, and of our boasting about you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal [reported] of you has stimulated the mass [of the brethren].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, *we*, that we say not *ye*, may be put to shame in this confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God [which is] upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks [be] to God for his unspeakable free gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, who, as to appearance, [when present] [am] mean among you, but absent am bold towards you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>but I beseech that present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I think to be daring towards some who think of us as walking according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the arms of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but powerful according to God to [the] overthrow of strongholds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do ye look at what concerns appearance? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let him think this again in himself, that even as he [is] of Christ, so also [are] we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>Now *we* will not boast out of measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not, as not reaching to you, overstretch ourselves, (for we have come to you also in the glad tidings of the Christ;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting out of measure in other people's labours, but having hope, your faith increasing, to be enlarged amongst you, according to our rule, yet more abundantly</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to announce the glad tidings to that [which is] beyond you, not to be boasting in another's rule of things made ready to hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not *he* that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>Would that ye would bear with me [in] a little folly; but indeed bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous as to you with a jealousy [which is] of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present [you] a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, [so] your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or ye get a different Spirit, which ye have not got, or a different glad tidings, which ye have not received, ye might well bear with [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I reckon that in nothing I am behind those who are in surpassing degree apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But if [I am] a simple person in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything making [the truth] manifest in all things to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Have I committed sin, abasing myself in order that *ye* might be exalted, because I gratuitously announced to you the glad tidings of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I spoiled other assemblies, receiving hire for ministry towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And being present with you and lacking, I did not lazily burden any one, (for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked,) and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>[The] truth of Christ is in me that this boasting shall not be stopped as to me in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing [for] an opportunity, that wherein they boast they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And [it is] not wonderful, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, Let not any one think me to be a fool; but if otherwise, receive me then even as a fool, that *I* also may boast myself some little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak I do not speak according to [the] Lord, but as in folly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many boast according to flesh, *I* also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For ye bear fools readily, being wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For ye bear if any one bring you into bondage, if any one devour [you], if any one get [your money], if any one exalt himself, if any one beat you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak as to dishonour, as though *we* had been weak; but wherein any one is daring, (I speak in folly,) *I* also am daring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? *I* also. Are they Israelites? *I* also. Are they seed of Abraham? *I* also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as being beside myself) *I* above measure [so]; in labours exceedingly abundant, in stripes to excess, in prisons exceedingly abundant, in deaths oft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>From the Jews five times have I received forty [stripes], save one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] nations, in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] desert, in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Besides those things that are without, the crowd [of cares] pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I burn not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If it is needful to boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows he who is blessed for ever that I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of [the] Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in [the] body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such [a one] caught up to [the] third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man, (whether in [the] body or out of the body I know not, God knows;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things said which it is not allowed to man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Of such [a one] I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I shall desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say [the] truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me [to be], or whatever he may hear of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, My grace suffices thee; for [my] power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool; *ye* have compelled me; for *I* ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But be it so. *I* did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I begged Titus, and sent the brother with [him]: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? [have we] not in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest [there might be] strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power; for indeed *we* are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice when *we* may be weak and *ye* may be powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>On this account I write these things being absent, that being present I may not use severity according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for overthrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>
