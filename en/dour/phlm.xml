      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
