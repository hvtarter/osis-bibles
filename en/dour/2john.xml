        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The ancient to the lady Elect, and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father; in truth and charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I was exceeding glad, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is charity, that we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face to face: that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</verse>
