      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And I said: WI beseech thee, 0 Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>And these are thy servants, and thy people : whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent wish me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliasib the high priest arose, and his brethren the priests, and they built the flock gate: they sanctified it, and set up the doors thereof, even unto the tower of a hundred cubits they sanctified it unto the tower of Hananeel.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said : Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stripped himself when he was to be washed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: Yet us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn be- cause of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields and our vineyards other men possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one ex- act usury of your brethren ? And I gathered together a great assembly against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them ? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you mere wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according to what was said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and in money every day forty sides: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>And there was prepared for me day by day one ox, and six choice rams, be- sides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much impoverished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember me, O my God, for good according to all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>Sanaballat and Gossem Rent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them : for which end</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said: Should such a man as I Bee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: m and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.</verse>
