      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</verse>
