      <chapter osisID='PssSol.1'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.1'>And they walked in the midst of the flame, praising God and blessing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.2'>Then Azarias standing up prayed in this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.3'>Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and thy name is worthy of praise, and glorious for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.4'>For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.5'>For thou hast executed true judgments in all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers: for according to truth and judgment, thou hast brought all these things upon us for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.6'>For we have sinned, and committed iniquity, departing from thee: and we have trespassed in all things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.7'>And we have not hearkened to thy commandments, nor have we observed nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might go well with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.8'>Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.9'>And thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies that are unjust, and most wicked, and prevaricators, and to a king unjust, and most wicked beyond all that axe upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.10'>And now we cannot open our mouths: we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.11'>Deliver us not up for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name's sake, and abolish not thy covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.12'>And take not away thy mercy from us for the sake of Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy holy one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.13'>To whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldst multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.14'>For we, O Lord, are diminished more than any nation, and are brought low in all the earth this day for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.15'>Neither is there at this time prince, or leader, or prophet, or holocaust, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place of firstfruits before thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.16'>That we may find thy mercy: nevertheless in a contrite heart and humble spirit let us be accepted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.17'>As in holocausts of rams, and bullocks, and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion to them that trust in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.18'>And now we follow thee with all our heart, and we fear thee, and seek thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.19'>Put us not to confusion, but deal. with us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.20'>And deliver us according to thy wonderful works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.21'>And let all them be confounded that shew evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.22'>And let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and glorious over all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.23'>Now the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace with brimstone, and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.24'>And the flame mounted up above the furnace nine and forty cubits:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.25'>And it broke forth, and burnt such of the Chaldeans as it found near the furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.26'>But the angel of the Lord went down with Azarias and his companions into the furnace: and he drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.27'>And made the midst of the furnace like the blowing of a wind bringing dew, and the fire touched them not at all, nor troubled them, nor did them any harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.28'>Then these three as with one mouth praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.29'>Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of our fathers: and worthy to be praised, and glorified, and exalted above all for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and worthy to be praised, and exalted above all in all ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.30'>Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory: and exceedingly to be praised, and exceeding glorious for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.31'>Blessed art thou on the throne of thy kingdom, and exceedingly to be praised, and exalted above all for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.32'>Blessed art thou, that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and worthy to be praised and exalted above all for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.1.33'>Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and worthy of praise, and glorious for ever.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='PssSol.3'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.1'>In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest, and of the Levitical race, and Ptolemy his son brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said Lysimachus the son of Ptolemy had interpreted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.2'>In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardochai the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the tribe of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.3'>A Jew who dwelt in the city of Susan, a great man and among the first of the king's court, had it dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.4'>Now he was of the number of the captives, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Juda:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.5'>And this was his dream: Behold there were voices, and tumults, and thunders, and earthquakes, and a disturbance upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.6'>And behold two great dragons came forth ready to fight one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.7'>And at their cry all nations were stirred up to fight against the nation of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.8'>And that was a day of darkness and danger, of tribulation and distress, and great fear upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.9'>And the nation of the just was troubled fearing their own evils, and was prepared for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.10'>And they cried to God: and as they were crying, a little fountain grew into a very great river, and abounded into many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.11'>The light and the sun rose up, and the humble were exalted, and they devoured the glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.3.12'>And when Mardochai had seen this, and arose out of his bed, he was thinking what God would do: and he kept it fixed in his mind, desirous to know what the dream should signify.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='PssSol.4'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.1'>And he abode at that time in the king's court with Bagatha and Thara the king's eunuchs, who were porters of the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.2'>And when he understood their designs, and had diligently searched into their projects, he learned that they went about to lay violent hands on king Artaxerxes, and he told the king thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.3'>Then the king had them both examined, and after they had confessed, commanded them to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.4'>But the king made a record of what was done: and Mardochai also committed the memory of the thing to writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.5'>And the king commanded him, to abide in the court of the palace, and gave him presents for the information.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.4.6'>But Aman the son of Amadathi the Bugite was in great honour with the king, and sought to hurt Mardochai and his people, because of the two eunuchs of the king who were put to death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='PssSol.5'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.1'>And this was the copy of the letter: Artaxerxes the great king who reigneth from India to Ethiopia, to the princes and governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, that are subject to his empire, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.2'>Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and lenity, that they might live quietly without any terror. and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.3'>But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.4'>Told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, despised the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.5'>Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all mankind using perverse laws, and going against our commandments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.6'>We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them. on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.7'>That these wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.8'>But Mardochai besought the Lord, remembering all his works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.9'>And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.10'>Thou hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are under the cope of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.11'>Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.12'>Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and contempt, or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.13'>(For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.14'>But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.15'>And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, be- cause our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.16'>Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.17'>Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, 0 Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.5.18'>And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='PssSol.6'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.1'>Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.2'>And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.3'>And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying: O my Lord, who alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.4'>My danger is in my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.5'>I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.6'>We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.7'>For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.8'>And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.9'>They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.10'>That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the strength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.11'>Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.12'>Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.13'>Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.14'>But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.18'>And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought hither unto this day, but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.6.19'>O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='PssSol.7'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.1'>And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.2'>Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.3'>And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.4'>And on the third day she laid away the garments she wore, and put on her glorious apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.5'>And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and Saviour of all, she took two maids with her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.6'>And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.7'>And the other maid followed her lady, bearing up her train flowing on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.8'>But she with a rosy colour in her face, and with gracious and bright eyes, hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.9'>So going in she passed through all the doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.10'>And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.11'>And God changed the king's spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.12'>What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.13'>Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.14'>Come near then, and touch the sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.15'>And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.16'>She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.17'>For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy. face is full of graces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.18'>And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.7.19'>But the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='PssSol.8'>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.1'>The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hundred and twenty- seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.2'>Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been bestowed upon them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.3'>And not only endeavour to oppress the king's subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand to practise also against them that gave it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.4'>Neither are they content not to re- turn thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.5'>And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all men's praise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.6'>While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.7'>Now this is proved both from ancient histories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.8'>Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.9'>Neither must you think, if we command different things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.10'>Now that you may more plainly understand what we say, I Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.11'>And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was worshipped by all as the next man after the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.12'>But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.13'>For with certain new and unheard of devices he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom, with all their nation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.14'>Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone without friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.15'>But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.16'>And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose benefit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.17'>Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.18'>For which crime both he himself that devised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.19'>But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.20'>And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.21'>For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.22'>Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.23'>That all they who faithfully obey the Persians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity : but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='PssSol.8.24'>And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such manner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobedience</verse>
