        <verse osisID='Tob.1.1'>All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.2'>Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.3'>Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.4'>Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.5'>The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.6'>To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who hath known her wise counsels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.7'>To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? and who hath understood the multiplicity of her steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.8'>There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.9'>He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.10'>And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.11'>The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.12'>The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.13'>With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.14'>The love of God is honourable wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.15'>Ana they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.16'>The fear of the Lord Is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.17'>The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.18'>Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.19'>It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.20'>To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.21'>She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the storehouses with her treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.22'>The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.23'>And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.24'>Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.25'>The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are longlived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.26'>In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.27'>The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.28'>For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.29'>A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy shall be restored to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.30'>A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.31'>In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of discipline:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.32'>But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.33'>Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.34'>For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.35'>Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.36'>Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.37'>Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.38'>Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.39'>And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.40'>Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.2'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.1'>Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.2'>Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.3'>Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.4'>Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.5'>For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.6'>Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.7'>Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him, lest ye fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.8'>Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.9'>Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come to you for your delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.10'>Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.11'>My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.12'>For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.13'>For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.14'>Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.15'>Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be protected by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.16'>Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.17'>And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.18'>They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.19'>They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.20'>They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.21'>They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.22'>Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.23'>For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Tob.3'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.1'>The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.2'>Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.3'>For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.4'>He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sine by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.5'>And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.6'>He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.7'>He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.8'>He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.9'>Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.10'>That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.11'>The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.12'>Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.13'>For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.14'>Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.15'>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be for- gotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.16'>For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.17'>And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sine shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.18'>Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.19'>My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.20'>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.21'>For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.22'>Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.23'>For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.24'>In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.25'>For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.26'>And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.27'>A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.28'>A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.29'>A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.30'>The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.31'>The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.32'>A wise heart, and which hath under- standing, will abstain from sine, and in the works of justice shall have success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.33'>Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.3.34'>And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.4.7'>Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.8'>Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.9'>Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.10'>In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.11'>And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.12'>Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.13'>And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.4.15'>They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.16'>He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.17'>If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.18'>For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.19'>She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.20'>Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.4.27'>Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.28'>And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.4.29'>For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.5.3'>And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.4'>Say not: I have sinned, and whet harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient rewarder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.5.10'>Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten: for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.11'>Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.12'>Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.5.14'>If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word, and be confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.15'>Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.16'>Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.5.17'>For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.49.20'>In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion, and became proud through his power.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.49.22'>And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.50.2'>His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.3'>He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.4'>And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.5'>Except David, and Ezechias, and Josias, all committed sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.6'>For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.7'>So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.8'>They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.9'>For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet from his mother's womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.10'>It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.11'>For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.12'>And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place: for they strengthened Jacob, and re- deemed themselves by strong faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.13'>How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on the right hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.14'>In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec? who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.15'>And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.16'>No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was taken up from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.50.17'>Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Tob.51'>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.1'>Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life propped up the house, and in his days fortified the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.2'>By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.3'>In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.4'>He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.5'>He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained glory in his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the house and the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.6'>He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.7'>And as the sun when it shineth, so did he shine in the temple of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.8'>And as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.51.10'>As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.11'>As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the perfection of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.12'>When he went up to the holy altar, he honoured the vesture of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.13'>And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the altar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.14'>And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.15'>And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high Ring,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.16'>He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.17'>He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.18'>Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.19'>Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.20'>And the singers lifted up their voices. and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.21'>And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High, until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished their office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.22'>Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with his lips, and to glory in his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.23'>And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.24'>And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.25'>May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be peace in our days in Israel for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.26'>That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.27'>There are two nations which my soul abhorreth: and the third is no nation, which I hate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.28'>They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.29'>Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed wisdom from his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.30'>Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things: and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.51.31'>For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things: because the light of God guideth his steps.</verse>
