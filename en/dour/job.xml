      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came among them, and stood in his sight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple, and upright, and fearing Cod, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence ? But thou hast moved me against him, that I sho uld afflict him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin, and all that a man hath he will give for his life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>gut put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt gee that he will bless thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the Lord said to Satan: Behold be is in thy hand, but yet save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence Of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>And he said to her: Thou hast; spoken like one of the foolish women: if we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Alphas the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, a nd comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out they wept, and rending their garments they sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>and he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill, but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: it hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>On the contrary I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions are broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth as it were received the veins of its whisper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice as it were of a gentle wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>Nothing upon earth is done without a voice cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>Man is born to labour and the bird to fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>And to the needy there shall he hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Blessed is the mall whom God correcteth: refuse not therefore the chastising of the lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands shall heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in battle, from the hand of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt he hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>In destruction and famine then shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at pence with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and visiting thy beauty thou shalt not sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied, and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap of wheat is brought in its season.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>But Job answered, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>As the sand of the sea this would appear heavier: therefore my words are full of sorrow :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth death?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end that I should keep patience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant in any thing, instruct me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>However finish what you have begun, give ear, and see whether I lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.3'>I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.4'>Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.5'>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.6'>His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.7'>One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.8'>They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.9'>His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.10'>Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.11'>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.12'>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.13'>In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.14'>The members of his flesh cleave one to another : he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.15'>His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.16'>When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.17'>When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.18'>For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.19'>The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.20'>As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.21'>The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.22'>He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.23'>A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.24'>There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered the Lord, and said :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, and I will speak : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite : My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before my, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust : and my servant Job shall pray for you : his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you : for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house : and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</verse>
