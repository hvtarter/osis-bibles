  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For the overseer must be blameless, as God's steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but given to hospitality, as a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God's word may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in all things showing yourself an example of good works. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>and a sound message that cannot be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of rebirth and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send Zenas, the Law scholar, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
