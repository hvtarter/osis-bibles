      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>A record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz was the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed was the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>And Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold, the virgin shall be with child,and shall bring forth a son.They shall call his name Immanuel;"which is, being interpreted, "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and had no marital relations with her until she had brought forth a son; and he named him Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>"Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Messiah would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,are in no way least among the princes of Judah:for out of you shall come forth a ruler,who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And they, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>Being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children;and she would not be comforted,because they are no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>"Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he will be called a Nazorean.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days John the Baptist came, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,make ready the way of the Lord.Make his paths straight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism he said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>"And even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John would have hindered him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus, answering, said to him, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he allowed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will put his angels in charge of you.' and,'On their hands they will bear you up,so that you do not dash your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Lord, your God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, andto those who sat in the region and shadow of death,to them light has dawned."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time, Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is near."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And he went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And the report about him went out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And great multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan followed him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain, and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are those who mourn,for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the gentle,for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful,for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart,for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers,for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake,for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you when men insult you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the Law, until all things are accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>"If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with him in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Lord your vows,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I tell you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shall you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you, do not resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away him who desires to borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I tell you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>"Be careful that you do not do your acts of charity before men, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when you do merciful deeds, do not sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do merciful deeds, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>"And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And in praying, do not use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Pray like this:'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us today our daily bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>Let us not come into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. [For yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.]'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>"Moreover when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>See the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>"And which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>"Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first his Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, "Truly I tell you, I have not found so great a faith with anyone in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, "What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?" They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you that one of you will betray me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, "It is not me, is it, Lord?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered, "He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Judas, who betrayed him, answered, "It is not me, is it, Rabbi?"He said to him, "You said it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>He took a cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's Kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What, could not you watch with me for one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is near."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I could not ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward. But at last two false witnesses came forward,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?"They answered, "He is worthy of death!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear, "I do not know the man!"Immediately the rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood."But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,"They took the thirty pieces of silver,the price of him upon whom a price had been set,whom some of the sons of Israel priced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter's field,as the Lord commanded me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?"Jesus said to him, "So you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"They said, "Barabbas!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called the Messiah?"They all said, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>But he said, "Why? What evil has he done?"But they shouted all the louder, saying, "Let him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>All the people answered, "May his blood be on us, and on our children!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>When they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They gave him wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>and they sat and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>They set up over his head the accusation against him written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, and the elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>"He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man is calling Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, "Let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus shouted again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel answered the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jewish people, and continues until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</verse>
