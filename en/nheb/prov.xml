      <chapter osisID='Prov.1'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>to know wisdom and instruction;to discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>to receive instruction in wise dealing,in righteousness, justice, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>to give prudence to the simple,knowledge and discretion to the young man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>to understand a proverb, and parables,the words and riddles of the wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, listen to your father's instruction,and do not forsake your mother's teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>for they will be a garland to grace your head,and chains around your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, "Come with us,Let's lie in wait for blood;let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>let's swallow them up alive like Sheol,and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We'll find all valuable wealth.We'll fill our houses with spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>You shall cast your lot among us.We'll all have one purse."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, do not walk in the way with them.Keep your foot from their path,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>for their feet run to evil.They hurry to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>but these lie in wait for their own blood.They lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.It takes away the life of its owners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom calls aloud in the street.She utters her voice in the public squares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She calls at the head of noisy places.At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn at my reproof.Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.I will make known my words to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you have refused;I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>but you have ignored all my counsel,and wanted none of my reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your disaster.I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>when calamity overtakes you like a storm,when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;when distress and anguish come on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>because they hated knowledge,and did not choose the fear of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They wanted none of my counsel.They despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,and be filled with their own schemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,and will be at ease, without fear of harm."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words,and store up my commandments within you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So as to turn your ear to wisdom,and apply your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yes, if you call out for discernment,and lift up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If you seek her as silver,and search for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>then you will understand the fear of the Lord,and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the Lord gives wisdom.Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>that he may guard the paths of justice,and preserve the way of his holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then you will understand righteousness and justice,equity and every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>For wisdom will enter into your heart.Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion will watch over you.Understanding will keep you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>to deliver you from the way of evil,from the men who speak perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>who forsake the paths of uprightness,to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>who rejoice to do evil,and delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>who are crooked in their ways,and wayward in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver you from the strange woman,even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>who forsakes the friend of her youth,and forgets the covenant of her God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>for her house leads down to death,her paths to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None who go to her return again,neither do they attain to the paths of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>that you may walk in the way of good men,and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright will dwell in the land.The perfect will remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked will be cut off from the land.The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, do not forget my teaching;but let your heart keep my commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>for length of days, and years of life,and peace, will they add to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Do not let kindness and truth forsake you.Bind them around your neck.Write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So you will find favor,and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the Lord with all your heart,and do not lean on your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him,and he will make your paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Do not be wise in your own eyes.Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be health to your body,and nourishment to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the Lord with your substance,with the first fruits of all your increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>so your barns will be filled with plenty,and your vats will overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline,neither be weary of his reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>for whom the Lord loves, he reproves;even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,the man who gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For her good profit is better than getting silver,and her return is better than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies.None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand.In her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness.All her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.Happy is everyone who retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>By wisdom the Lord founded the earth.By understanding, he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,and the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let them not depart from your eyes.Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>so they will be life to your soul,and grace for your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then you shall walk in your way securely.Your foot won't stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you will not be afraid.Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Do not be afraid of sudden fear,neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>for the Lord will be your confidence,and will keep your foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again;tomorrow I will give it to you,"when you have it by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Do not devise evil against your neighbor,seeing he dwells securely by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Do not strive with a man without cause,if he has done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Do not envy the man of violence.Choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the perverse is an abomination to the Lord,but his friendship is with the upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The Lord's curse is in the house of the wicked,but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely he is scornful to scoffers,but he gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise will inherit glory,but shame will be the promotion of fools.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Listen, sons, to a father's instruction.Pay attention and know understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>for I give you sound learning.Do not forsake my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was a son to my father,tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>He taught me, and said to me:"Let your heart retain my words.Keep my commandments, and live.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.The years of your life will be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught you in the way of wisdom.I have led you in straight paths.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it, and do not pass by it.Turn from it, and pass on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they do not sleep, unless they do evil.Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness,and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,that shines more and more until the perfect day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is like darkness.They do not know what they stumble over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, attend to my words.Turn your ear to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Let them not depart from your eyes.Keep them in the midst of your heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, pay attention to my wisdom.Turn your ear to my understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>that you may maintain discretion,that your lips may preserve knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.Her mouth is smoother than oil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death.Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>She gives no thought to the way of life.Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove your way far from her.Do not come near the door of her house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>lest you give your honor to others,and your years to the cruel one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>lest strangers feast on your wealth,and your labors enrich another man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>You will groan at your latter end,when your flesh and your body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>and say, "How I have hated instruction,and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I have come to the brink of utter ruin,in the midst of the gathered assembly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink water out of your own cistern,running water out of your own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Should your springs overflow in the streets,streams of water in the public squares?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.17'>Let them be for yourself alone,not for strangers with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.18'>Let your spring be blessed.Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.19'>A loving doe and a graceful deer-let her breasts satisfy you at all times.Be captivated always with her love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.20'>For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?Why embrace the bosom of another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord.He examines all his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.23'>He will die for lack of instruction.In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.1'>My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.2'>You are trapped by the words of your mouth.You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.3'>Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor.Go, humble yourself.Press your plea with your neighbor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.9'>How long will you sleep, sluggard?When will you arise out of your sleep?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.10'>A little sleep, a little slumber,a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.11'>so your poverty will come as a robber,and your scarcity as an armed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A worthless person, a man of iniquity,is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet,who motions with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>in whose heart is perverseness,who devises evil continually,who always sows discord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>There are six things which the Lord hates;yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>haughty eyes, a lying tongue,hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>a heart that devises wicked schemes,feet that are swift in running to mischief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>a false witness who utters lies,and he who sows discord among brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.23'>For the commandment is a lamp,and the Law is light.Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.24'>to keep you from the immoral woman,from the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.26'>For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</verse>
