      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Diaspora in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy became our father again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been put to grief in various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom not having seen you love; in whom, though now you do not see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To them it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, they ministered these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I am holy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with precious blood, as of a faultless and pure lamb, the blood of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead, and gave Him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from a pure heart fervently:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For,"All flesh is like grass,and all it's glory like the flower in the grass.The grass withers, and its flower falls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of the Lord endures forever."This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>coming to him, a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Because it is contained in Scripture,"Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, and precious:He who believes in him will not be disappointed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>For you who believe therefore is the honor, but for those who do not believe,"The stone which the builders rejected,has become the chief cornerstone,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and,"a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense."For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who in time past were no people, but now are God's people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having good behavior among the nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory is it if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>Who, when he was cursed, did not curse back. When he suffered, did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by his stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were going astray like sheep; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In like manner, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; so that, even if any do not obey the Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>seeing your pure behavior in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God very precious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For this is how the holy women before, who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>You husbands, in like manner, live with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, be all like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but instead blessing; because to this were you called, that you may inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For,"He who would love life,and see good days,let him keep his tongue from evil,and his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil, and do good.Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,and his ears open to their prayer;but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>Now who is he who will harm you, if you become zealous of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear, neither be troubled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with humility and fear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience; so that when they speak evil against you, they may be put to shame who slander your good manner of life in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who before were disobedient, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, while the ship was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you-not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For enough time in the past has been spent doing the will of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness, lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>They think it is strange that you do not run with them into the same excess of riot, blaspheming:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh, but live as to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>But the end of all things is near. Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As each has received a gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men's matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who do not obey the Good News of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to God; not for dishonest gain, but willingly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, towards one another; for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him be the power forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.</verse>
