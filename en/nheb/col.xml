      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, do not cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father, who made you fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of the invisible God, existing before all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>He is before all things, and in him all things are held together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and through him to reconcile all things to himself, by him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens, having made peace through the blood of his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and blameless before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if it is so that you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I was made a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you, to fulfill the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to them God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>for which I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, which is Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in it in thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Be careful that you do not let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in him all the fullness of God's nature dwells bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us; and he has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having stripped the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>"Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>(all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ, your life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death, therefore, whatever is worldly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as the Lord forgave you, so you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they won't be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, "if he comes to you, receive him"),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, men who have been a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I testify about him, that he has worked hard for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that is in her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>Tell Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you.</verse>
