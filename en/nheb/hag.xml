      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of the Lord came by Haggai, the prophet, to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>"This is what the Lord of hosts says: These people say, 'The time hasn't yet come, the time for the Lord's house to be built.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then the Word of the Lord came by Haggai, the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>"Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore this is what the Lord of hosts says: Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>You have sown much, and bring in little. You eat, but you do not have enough. You drink, but you aren't filled with drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm, and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>This is what the Lord of hosts says: "Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>"You looked for much, and, behold, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?" says the Lord of hosts, "Because of my house that lies waste, while each of you is busy with his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the ground brings forth, on men, on livestock, and on all the labor of the hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord, their God, and the words of Haggai, the prophet, as the Lord, their God, had sent him; and the people feared the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then Haggai, the Lord's messenger, spoke the Lord's message to the people, saying, "I am with you," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>The Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the Lord of hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>"Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn't it in your eyes as nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,' says the Lord. 'Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,' says the Lord, 'and work, for I am with you,' says the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. 'Do not be afraid.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For this is what the Lord of hosts says: 'Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,' says the Lord of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>'The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,' says the Lord of hosts; 'and in this place will I give peace,' says the Lord of hosts."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>"Thus says the Lord of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>'If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?'"The priests answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then Haggai said, "If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?"The priests answered, "It will be unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then Haggai answered, "'So is this people, and so is this nation before me,' says the Lord; 'and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you did not turn to me,' says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>'Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid, consider it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven't brought forth. From this day will I bless you.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>The Word of the Lord came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>"Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, 'I will shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, says the Lord of hosts, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,' says the Lord, 'and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,' says the Lord of hosts."</verse>
