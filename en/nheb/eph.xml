      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved One,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation,-in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>You were made alive when you were dead in your transgressions and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, that no one would boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision," (in the flesh, made by hands);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>He came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>to the intent that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause, I bow my knees before the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and to know Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore he says, "When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>Now this, "He ascended," what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you did not learn Christ that way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>"Be angry, and do not sin." Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>neither give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Therefore do not be partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>Do not be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that he might present the church to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also does the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>because we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>"For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>"Honor your father and mother," which is the first commandment with a promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>"that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>You fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Servants, be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not in the way of service only when eyes are on you, as men pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good thing each one does, he will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is bound or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>You masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of this darkness, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>with all prayer and requests, praying at all times in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end in all perseverance and requests for all the saints:</verse>
