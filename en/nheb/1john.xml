      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard we declare to you also, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And we write these things, that our joy may be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not tell the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>One who says, "I know him," and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever keeps his word, God's love has truly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not the Father's, but is the world's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God's will remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Anti-Christ is coming, even now many anti-Christs have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Anti-Christ, he who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>As for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world does not know us, because it did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are children of God, and it is not yet revealed what we will be. We know that, when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whoever remains in him does not sin. Whoever sins hasn't seen him, neither knows him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Whoever is born of God does not commit sin, because his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love remains in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoever has the world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>Little children, let us not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And by this we will know that we are of the truth, and persuade our heart before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness toward God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit who does not confess Jesus is not of God, and this is the spirit of the Anti-Christ, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the world already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>By this God's love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love, because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If a man says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three who testify:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is God's testimony that he has testified concerning his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He who has the Son has the life. He who does not have God's Son does not have the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>This is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death. I do not say that he should make a request concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that whoever is born of God does not sin, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</verse>
