      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>They said to me, "The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, "I beg you, Lord, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>"Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>"Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>Lord, I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."Now I was cup bearer to the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>It happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad before in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>The king said to me, "Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart."Then I was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>I said to the king, "Let the king live forever! Why shouldn't my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, "For what do you make request?"So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may build it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>The king said to me (the queen was also sitting by him), "For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return?"So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into."The king granted my requests, because of the good hand of my God on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the spring gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>The rulers did not know where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them, "You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won't be disgraced."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me.They said, "Let's rise up and build." So they strengthened their hands for the good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us, and despised us, and said, "What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then answered I them, and said to them, "The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up its doors; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananel.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it happened that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they are burned?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, "What they are building, if a fox climbed up it, he would break down their stone wall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>"Hear, our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach on their own head, give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they have insulted the builders."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height: for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it happened that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be filled, then they were very angry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>Judah said, "The strength of the bearers of burdens is fading, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>Our adversaries said, "They shall not know, neither see, until we come into their midst, and kill them, and cause the work to cease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>It happened that when the Jews who lived by them came, they said to us ten times from all places, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>It happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>It happened from that time forth, that half of my servants worked in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They all built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>and the builders, everyone wore his sword at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally there to us. Our God will fight for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we worked in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time said I to the people, "Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes. Everyone took his weapon to the water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were that said, "We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>Some also there were that said, "We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also some who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. Neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, "You exact usury, everyone of his brother." I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>I said to them, "We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?" Then they held their peace, and found never a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, "The thing that you do is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Please restore to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then they said, "We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say."Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook out my lap, and said, "So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn't perform this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied."All the assembly said, "Amen," and praised the Lord. The people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were around us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it happened, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono." But they intended to harm me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work, so that I can't come down. Why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>in which was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, 'There is a king in Judah!' Now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent to him, saying, "There are no such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, "Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, strengthen my hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home; and he said, "Let us meet together in God's house, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>I said, "Should such a man as I flee? Who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>I discerned, and behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>He hired so that I would be afraid, do so, and sin, and that they might have material for an unfavorable report, that they might taunt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>"Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>It happened, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations that were about us were afraid, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it happened, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>that I put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.3'>He read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.4'>Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.5'>Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.6'>and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. All the people answered, "Amen, Amen," with the lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.8'>They read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.8.9'>Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites who taught the people, said to all the people, "This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn, nor weep." For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.8.17'>All the assembly of those who had come again out of the captivity made booths, and lived in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.9'>"You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.10'>and showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of his land; for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a name for yourself, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.11'>You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.12'>Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.13'>"You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.20'>You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.21'>"Yes, forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. Their clothes did not grow old, and their feet did not swell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.22'>Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.23'>You also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.25'>They took fortified cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.26'>"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.</verse>

In the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.28'>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times you delivered them according to your mercies,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.30'>Yet many years you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets. Yet would they not give ear. Therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden should be brought in on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified against them, and said to them, "Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on, they did not come on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus I cleansed them from all foreigners, and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good.</verse>
