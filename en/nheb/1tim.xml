      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause speculation, rather than God's stewardship, which is in faith-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for the sexually immoral, nor men who practice sexual relations with men, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>to which I was appointed a proclaimer and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>But I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(but if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great:He was revealed in the flesh,justified in the spirit,seen by angels,preached among the nations,believed on in the world,and received up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But refuse profane and old wives' tales. Exercise yourself toward godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this end we both labor and strive, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Command and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in faith, and in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Also command these things, that they may be without reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For already some have turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any woman who believes has widows, let her assist them, and do not let the church be burdened; that it might help those widows who are truly in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain." And, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I command you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men's sins. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and does not consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into the world, so neither can we carry anything out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>But having food and clothing, we will be content with that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of that which is truly life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.</verse>
