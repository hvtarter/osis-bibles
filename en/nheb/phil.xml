      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace to you, and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God whenever I remember you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every request of mine on behalf of you all making my requests with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your partnership in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Now I desire to have you know, brothers, that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that it became evident to the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed proclaim Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The former insincerely proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether out of false motives or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I do not make known what I will choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>But I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Yet, to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear is in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmurings and disputes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome, but for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>However, what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>More than that, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect; but I press on, if it is so that I may take hold of that for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not regard myself as yet having taken hold, but one thing I do. Forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forward to the things which are ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal that to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, to what we have attained, to the same continue on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brothers, be imitators together of me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the cross of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think about earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will change our lowly bodies into the likeness of his glorious body, according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I beg you also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the Good News, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always! Again I will say, Rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things which you learned, received, heard, and saw in me: do these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in respect to lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be humbled, and I know also how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>However you did well that you shared in my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You yourselves also know, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all things, and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
