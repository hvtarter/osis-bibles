  <div type='book' osisID='Hos'>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of the Lord that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When the Lord spoke at the first by Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea, "Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>The Lord said to him, "Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>She conceived again, and bore a daughter.Then he said to him, "Call her name Lo-Ruhamah; for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>He said, "Call his name Lo-Ammi; for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can't be measured nor numbered; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>"Say to your brothers, 'My people!'and to your sisters, 'My loved one!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>Contend with your mother!Contend, for she is not my wife,neither am I her husband;and let her put away her prostitution from her face,and her adulteries from between her breasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>Lest I strip her naked,and make her bare as in the day that she was born,and make her like a wilderness,and set her like a dry land,and kill her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;for they are children of unfaithfulness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>For their mother has played the prostitute.She who conceived them has done shamefully;for she said, 'I will go after my lovers,who give me my bread and my water,my wool and my flax,my oil and my drink.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,and I will build a wall against her,that she can't find her way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>She will follow after her lovers,but she won't overtake them;and she will seek them,but won't find them.Then she will say, 'I will go and return to my first husband;for then was it better with me than now.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,and my new wine in its season,and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,and no one will deliver her out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,about which she has said, 'These are my wages that my lovers have given me;and I will make them a forest,'and the animals of the field shall eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>I will visit on her the days of the Baals,to which she burned incense,when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,and went after her lovers,and forgot me," says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>"Therefore, behold, I will allure her,and bring her into the wilderness,and speak tenderly to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>I will give her vineyards from there,and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;and she will respond there,as in the days of her youth,and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>It will be in that day," says the Lord,"that you will call me 'my husband,'and no longer call me 'my master.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,and they will no longer be mentioned by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,and with the birds of the sky,and with the creeping things of the ground.I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,and will make them lie down safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>I will betroth you to me forever.Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;and you shall know the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>It will happen in that day, I will respond," says the Lord,"I will respond to the heavens,and they will respond to the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;and they will respond to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>I will sow her to me in the earth;and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;and I will tell those who were not my people, 'You are my people;'and they will say, 'My God!'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>The Lord said to me, "Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>I said to her, "You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to the Lord and to his blessings in the last days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of the Lord, you children of Israel;for the Lord has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:"Indeed there is no truth,nor goodness,nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the land will mourn,and everyone who dwells therein will waste away,all living things in her,even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;yes, the fish of the sea also die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>"Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>You will stumble in the day,and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;and I will destroy your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,that you may be no priest to me.Because you have forgotten your God's law,I will also forget your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sin of my people,and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>It will be, like people, like priest;and I will punish them for their ways,and will repay them for their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>They will eat, and not have enough.They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;because they have abandoned giving to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people consult with their wooden idol,and answer to a stick of wood.Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,and they have been unfaithful to their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,because its shade is good.Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,and your brides commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,nor your brides when they commit adultery;because the men consort with prostitutes,and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;so the people without understanding will come to ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>"Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,yet do not let Judah offend;and do not come to Gilgal,neither go up to Beth Aven,nor swear, 'As the Lord lives.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.Then how will the Lord feed them like a lamb in a meadow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols.Leave him alone!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink has become sour.They play the prostitute continually.Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>"Listen to this, you priests!Listen, house of Israel,and give ear, house of the king!For the judgment is against you;for you have been a snare at Mizpah,and a net spread on Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>The rebels are deep in slaughter;but I discipline all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>I know Ephraim,and Israel is not hidden from me;for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>Their deeds won't allow them to turn to their God;for the spirit of prostitution is within them,and they do not know the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>The pride of Israel testifies to his face.Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.Judah also will stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord;but they won't find him.He has withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>They are unfaithful to the Lord;for they have borne illegitimate children.Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>"Blow the cornet in Gibeah,and the trumpet in Ramah!Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>Ephraim is oppressed,he is crushed in judgment;Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,and to the house of Judah like rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>"When Ephraim saw his sickness,and Judah his wound,Then Ephraim went to Assyria,and sent to king Jareb:but he is not able to heal you,neither will he cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,and like a young lion to the house of Judah.I myself will tear in pieces and go away.I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>I will go and return to my place,until they acknowledge their offense,and seek my face.In their affliction they will seek me earnestly."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>"Come, and let us return to the Lord;for he has torn us to pieces,and he will heal us;he has injured us,and he will bind up our wounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>After two days he will revive us.On the third day he will raise us up,and we will live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>Let us acknowledge the Lord.Let us press on to know the Lord.As surely as the sun rises,The Lord will appear.He will come to us like the rain,like the spring rain that waters the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>"Ephraim, what shall I do to you?Judah, what shall I do to you?For your love is like a morning cloud,and like the dew that disappears early.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;I killed them with the words of my mouth.Your judgments are like a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.They were unfaithful to me, there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;it is stained with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man,so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem,committing shameful crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.There is prostitution in Ephraim.Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>"Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,when I restore the fortunes of my people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>When I would heal Israel,then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,also the wickedness of Samaria;for they commit falsehood,and the thief enters in,and the gang of robbers ravages outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>They do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.Now their own deeds have engulfed them.They are before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>They make the king glad with their wickedness,and the princes with their lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>They are all adulterers.They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.He joined his hand with mockers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>For they have made ready their heart like an oven,while they lie in wait.Their baker sleeps all the night.In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>They are all hot as an oven,and devour their judges.All their kings have fallen.There is no one among them who calls to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>Strangers have devoured his strength,and he doesn't realize it.Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,and he doesn't realize it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>The pride of Israel testifies to his face;yet they haven't returned to the Lord their God,nor sought him, for all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>"Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.They call to Egypt.They go to Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>When they go, I will spread my net on them.I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>Woe to them!For they have wandered from me.Destruction to them!For they have trespassed against me.Though I would redeem them,yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>They haven't cried to me with their heart,but they howl on their beds.They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.They turn away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,yet they plot evil against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>They return, but not to the Most High.They are like a faulty bow.Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>"Put the trumpet to your lips!Something like an eagle is over the Lord's house,because they have broken my covenant,and rebelled against my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>They cry to me, 'My God, we Israel acknowledge you!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>Israel has cast off that which is good.The enemy will pursue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>They have set up kings, but not by me.They have made princes, and I did not approve.Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,that they may be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!My anger burns against them!How long will it be until they are capable of purity?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>For this is even from Israel!The workman made it, and it is no God;indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>For they sow the wind,and they will reap the whirlwind.He has no standing grain.The stalk will yield no head.If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>Israel is swallowed up.Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>For they have gone up to Assyria,like a wild donkey wandering alone.Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>But although they sold themselves among the nations,I will now gather them;and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,they became for him altars for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>I wrote for him the many things of my law;but they were regarded as a strange thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>As for the sacrifices of my offerings,they sacrifice flesh and eat it;But the Lord doesn't accept them.Now he will remember their iniquity,and punish their sins.They will return to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;but I will send a fire on his cities,and it will devour its fortresses."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>Do not rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;for you were unfaithful to your God.You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>The threshing floor and the winepress won't feed them,and the new wine will fail her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>They won't dwell in the Lord's land;but Ephraim will return to Egypt,and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>They won't pour out wine offerings to the Lord,neither will they be pleasing to him.Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;all who eat of it will be polluted;for their bread will be for their appetite.It will not come into the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,and in the day of the feast of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.Egypt will gather them up.Memphis will bury them.Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.Thorns will be in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The days of visitation have come.The days of reckoning have come.Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,and the man who is inspired to be insane,because of the abundance of your sins,and because your hostility is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.A fowler's snare is on all of his paths,and hostility in the house of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.9'>They have deeply corrupted themselves,as in the days of Gibeah.He will remember their iniquity.He will punish them for their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.10'>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,and became abominable like that which they loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.11'>As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.There will be no birth, none with child, and no conception.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.12'>Though they bring up their children,yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.13'>I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.10.1'>Israel is a luxuriant vine that puts forth his fruit.According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.2'>Their heart is divided.Now they will be found guilty.He will demolish their altars.He will destroy their sacred stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.3'>Surely now they will say, "We have no king; for we do not fear the Lord;and the king, what can he do for us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.4'>They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Hos.10.11'>Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.I will set a rider on Ephraim.Judah will plow.Jacob will break his clods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.10.12'>Sow to yourselves in righteousness,reap according to kindness.Break up your fallow ground;for it is time to seek the Lord,until he comes and rains righteousness on you.</verse>
