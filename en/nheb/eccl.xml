      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is lacking can't be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth: therefore enjoy pleasure;" and behold, this also was vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth, "What does it accomplish?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I made myself great works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were reared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men-musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>Whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them. I did not withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for what can the king's successor do? Just that which has been done long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness-and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like the fool!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>a time to be born,and a time to die;a time to plant,and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>a time to kill,and a time to heal;a time to break down,and a time to build up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>a time to weep,and a time to laugh;a time to mourn,and a time to dance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>a time to cast away stones,and a time to gather stones together;a time to embrace,and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>a time to seek,and a time to lose;a time to keep,and a time to cast away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>a time to tear,and a time to sew;a time to keep silence,and a time to speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>a time to love,and a time to hate;a time for war,and a time for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can't find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which is passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals: for all is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.3'>Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man's neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment? This also is vanity, yes, it is a miserable business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't have another to lift him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.11'>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.12'>If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.13'>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn't know how to receive admonition any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.14'>For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.15'>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.16'>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was-yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.1'>Guard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.2'>Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.3'>For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's speech with a multitude of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.4'>When you vow a vow to God, do not defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.5'>It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.6'>Do not allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Do not protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.7'>For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words: but you must fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.8'>If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a district, do not marvel at the matter: for one official is eyed by a higher one; and there are officials over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.9'>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all. The king profits from the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.10'>He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.11'>When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.12'>The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.13'>There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.14'>Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.15'>As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.16'>This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.17'>All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.18'>Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.19'>Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.5.20'>For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.1'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy on men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.2'>a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but a foreigner eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.3'>If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn child is better than he:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.4'>for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.5'>Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it. This has rest rather than the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.6'>Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails to enjoy good, do not all go to one place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.7'>All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.8'>For what advantage has the wise more than the fool? What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.9'>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.10'>Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.11'>For there are many words that create vanity. What does that profit man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.6.12'>For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.7'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.1'>A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one's birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.2'>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living should take this to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.3'>Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.4'>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.5'>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.6'>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.7'>Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.8'>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.9'>Do not be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.10'>Do not say, "Why were the former days better than these?" For you do not ask wisely about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.11'>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.12'>For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.13'>Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.14'>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.15'>All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.16'>Do not be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.17'>Do not be too wicked, neither be foolish. Why should you die before your time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.18'>It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also from that do not withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come forth from them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.19'>Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.20'>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good and doesn't sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.21'>Also do not take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.22'>for often your own heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.23'>All this have I proved in wisdom. I said, "I will be wise;" but it was far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.24'>That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.25'>I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.26'>I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.27'>Behold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another, to find out the scheme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.28'>which my soul still seeks; but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.7.29'>Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they search for many schemes.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.8'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.1'>Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.2'>I say, "Keep the king's command!" because of the oath to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.3'>Do not be hasty to go out of his presence. Do not persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.4'>for the king's word is supreme. Who can say to him, "What are you doing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.5'>Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm, and his wise heart will know the time and procedure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.6'>For there is a time and procedure for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.7'>For he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him how it will be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.8'>There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.9'>All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.10'>So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.11'>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.12'>Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.13'>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.14'>There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.15'>Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.16'>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.8.17'>then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won't be able to find it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.9'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.1'>For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it; all is before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.2'>All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.3'>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.4'>For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.5'>For the living know that they will die, but the dead do not know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.6'>Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.7'>Go your way-eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.8'>Let your garments be always white, and do not let your head lack oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.9'>Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity: for that is your portion in life, and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.10'>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.11'>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.12'>For man also doesn't know his time. As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.13'>I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.14'>There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great siege works against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.15'>Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.16'>Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.17'>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.9.18'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.10'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.1'>Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.2'>A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.3'>Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.4'>If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.5'>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.6'>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.7'>I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.8'>He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.9'>Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.10'>If the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.11'>If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer's tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.12'>The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.13'>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.14'>A fool also multiplies words.Man doesn't know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.15'>The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't know how to go to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.16'>Woe to you, land, when your king is a child,and your princes eat in the morning!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.17'>Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,and your princes eat in due season,for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.18'>By slothfulness the roof sinks in;and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.19'>A feast is made for laughter,and wine makes the life glad;and money is the answer for all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.10.20'>Do not curse the king, no, not in your thoughts;and do not curse the rich in your bedchamber:for a bird of the sky may carry your voice,and that which has wings may tell the matter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.1'>Cast your bread on the waters;for you shall find it after many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.2'>Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight;for you do not know what evil will be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.3'>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.4'>He who observes the wind won't sow;and he who regards the clouds won't reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.11.5'>As you do not know what is the way of the wind,nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;even so you do not know the work of God who does all.</verse>
