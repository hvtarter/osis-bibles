The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard the faith of you in Anointed Jesus, and the love that for all the holy ones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>through the hope that being laid up for you in the heavens, which you before heard in the word of the truth of the glad tidings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>of that being present among you, as also in all the world, and is bringing forth fruit and growing, as also in you, from which day you heard and acknowledged the favor of the God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as even you learned from Epaphras the beloved fellowservant of us, who is faithful on behalf of you a servant of the Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also having related to us the of you love in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>Because of this also we, from which day we heard, not we cease on behalf of you praying, and asking, that you may be filled the exact knowledge of the will of him in all wisdom and understanding spiritual;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every work good bringing forth fruit and growing in the exact knowledge of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>with all strength being strengthened according to the power of the glory of him, for all patience and endurance with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father to that having fitted us for the portion of the inheritance of the holy ones in the light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who delivered us from the authority of the darkness, and caused a change of sides for the kingdom of the son of the love of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have the redemption the forgiveness of the sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is a likeness of the God of that unseen, firstborn of every creation; Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>because in him were created the things all, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, the things seen and the things unseen, whether thrones, or lordships, or governments, or authorities; the things all on account of him and for him have been created;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>and he is in advance of all, and the things all in him has been placed together; Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>and he is the head of the body, of the congregation; who is a beginning, firstborn out of the dead ones, so that he might become among all himself preeminent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>because in him it was thought good all the fulness to inhabit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by means of him to reconcile the things all to him, having made peace by means of the blood of the cross of him, by means of him, whether the things on the earth, or the things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>Even you, once being aliens and enemies in the mind by the works those wicked, now indeed he reconciled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>in the body of the flesh of himself by means of the death, to present you holy ones and blameless ones and irreproachable ones in presence of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if indeed you continue in the faith having been grounded and settled ones, and not being moved away from the hope of the glad tidings of which you heard, of that having been published in all the creation that under the heaven; of which became I Paul a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I rejoice in the sufferings on behalf of you, and I fill up the wants of the afflictions of the Anointed one in the flesh of me on behalf of the body of him, which is the congregation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which became I a servant according to the stewardship of the God that having been given to me for you, to fully set forth the word of the God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the secret that having been hid from the ages and from the generations, now but was manifested to the holy ones of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom wished the God to make known, what the wealth of the glory of the secret of this among the nations, who is Anointed in you, the hope of the glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching, every man with all wisdom, so that we may present man perfect in Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>for which also I labor, ardently contending according to the strongworking of him that working strongly in me in power.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>I wish for you to know, how great a conflict I have concerning you and those in Laodicea, and as many as not have seen the face of me in flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>so that may be comforted the hearts of them, being knit together in love and for all wealth of the full conviction of the understanding, in order to an exact knowledge of the secret of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in which are all the treasures of the wisdom and of the knowledge stored up. Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>This but I say, that not any one you may deceive with plausible speech. Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>If for even in the flesh I am absent, still in the spirit with you I am, rejoicing and beholding of you the order, and the stability of the in Anointed faith of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As therefore you received the Anointed Jesus the Lord, in him walk you, Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>having been rooted and being build up in him, and being established in the faith, as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>See you, not any one you shall be the making a prey by means of the philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of the men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>Because in him dwells all the fulness of the deity bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and you are by him having been filled; who is the head of all governments and authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried with him by the dipping; in which also you were raised by means of the faith of the strong working of the God of that one having raised him out of dead ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>and you, dead being in the faults and by the uncircumcision of the flesh of you, he made alive together with him, having freely forgiven us all the faults;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having blotted out that against us written by hand in the ordinances, which was contrary to us, and it he has removed out of the midst, having nailed it to the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having stripped off the governments and the authorities, he made a show by publicity, having triumphed over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Not therefore any one you let judge in food or in drink, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the things about coming, the but body of Anointed. Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>No one you let deprive of the prize, wishing by humility of mind and a religious worship of the messengers, what things not he has seen prying into, without cause being puffed up by the mind of the flesh of himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding firmly the head, from whom all the body, by means of the joints and ligaments being served and being compacted, grows the growth of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If you died with Anointed from the elements of the world, why as living in world do you impose on yourselves ordinances;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>(not thou shouldst have touched, nor thou shouldst have tasted, nor thou shouldst have handled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>which is all for corruption in the using,) according to the commands and teachings of the men; which things is a wordy show indeed having of wisdom in selfdevised worship and humility and nonindulgence of body, not in honor any, for a filling up of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If then you were raised with the Anointed, the things above seek you, where the Anointed is at right of the God sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>the things above mind you, not the things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>You did for, and the life of you has been hidden with the Anointed by the God; Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>when the Anointed may appear, the life of us, then also you with him shall appear in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put you to death therefore the members of you those on the earth, fornication, impurity, passion, desire evil, and the covetousness, which is idol worship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>because of which things comes the wrath of the God on the sons of the disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which things also you walked once, when you were living among them; Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>now but put off also you the things all, anger, wrath, malice, evil speaking, filthy words out of the mouth of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>not speak you falsely to each other; having stripped the old man with the practices of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and having put on the new, that being renewed by exact knowledge according to an image of the one having created him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where not exists Greek and Jew; circumcision and uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian; slave, freeman; but the things all and in all Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Be you clothed therefore, as chosen ones of God holy ones and beloved ones, bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patient endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>(bearing with each other, and freely forgiving each other, if any one for some things should have a cause of complaint; as even the Anointed freely forgave you, so also you;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>besides all and these the love, which is a bond of the completeness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>and the peace of the Anointed one let preside in the hearts of you, for which also you were called in one body; and thankful ones become you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>The word of the Anointed let dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching, and admonishing each other in psalms and in hymns and in songs spiritual, with favor singing in the hearts of you to the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>and every thing, whatever you may do, in word or in work, all in name of Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>The wives, submit yourselves to the husbands, as it has been proper in Lord. Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>The husbands, love you the wives, and not be you embittered against them. Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>The children, be you subject to the parents in all things; this for is wellpleasing in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>The fathers, not do you provoke the children of you, so that not they may be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>The slaves, be you subject in all things to the according to flesh lords, not with service of eyes, as menpleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>and every thing, whatever you may do, from soul work you, as to the Lord and not to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>Knowing, that from Lord you will receive the recompence of the inheritance, the for Lord Anointed you serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>He but doing wrong will receive back what he did wrong; and not is respect of persons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>To the prayer attend you constantly, watching in it, with thankfulness; Colossians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>praying at the same time also for us, that the God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Anointed, on account of which even I have been bound; Colossians</verse>
