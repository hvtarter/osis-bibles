The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>to whom for not is present these things, blind is, being shortsighted, a forgetfulness having received of the purification of the old of himself sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore rather, brethren, do you earnestly strive sure of you the calling and election to make; these things for doing not not you may fail at any time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>So for richly will be furnished to you the entrance into the agelasting kingdom of the Lord of us and Savior Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore not I will neglect always you to remind concerning these things, although knowing, and being established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>Right and I think, in as much as I am in this the tabernacle, to stir up you by a reminding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing, that near at hand it is the laying aside of the tabernacle of me, as even the Lord of us Jesus Anointed declared to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>I will endeavor but also always, to have you after the my departure, the of these things a recollection to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>Not for having been cunningly devised tales having followed out we made known to you the of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed power and presence, but lookers on having become of the of that greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>Having received for from God a Father honor and glory, from a voice having been brought to him of this kind by the magnificent glory: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I am delighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And this the voice we heard from heaven having been brought with him being in the mountain the holy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>and we have more firm the prophetic word; to which well you do taking heed, as to a lamp shining in a filthy place, till of which a day may shine through, and bring light may arise in the hearts of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>this first knowing, that all prophecy of a writing, of its own loosing not it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>Not for by will of man was brought at any time prophecy, but by spirit holy being moved spoke holy of God men.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>Were but even false prophets among the people, as also among you will be false teachers, who will privately introduce heresies of destruction, even the having bought them sovereign Lord denying, bring on themselves swift destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>(and many will follow of them the impure practice, on account of whom the way of the truth will be evil spoken of;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>and by covetousness deceitful words you they will make gain of; to whom the judgment of old not lingers, and the destruction of them not slumbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>If for the God messengers having sinned not spared, but with chains of think darkness having confined Tartarus he delivered up for a judgment being kept;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and of old a world not he spared, but eighth Noah of righteousness a herald he kept safe a deluge to a world of impious one having brought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having reduced to ashes to an overthrow he condemned, an example future to be impious having been placed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and just Lot being wearied by the of the lawless ones in lewdness of behavior he rescued;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(in seeing for and in hearing the just one, dwelling among them, day by days soul righteousness with lawless deeds was tormented;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>knows Lord pious ones out of temptation to rescue, unjust ones but for a day of judgment being cut off to be kept;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>especially but those after flesh in lust of pollution going, and lordship despising. Daring, selfwilled, of dignities not they are afraid speaking evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>where messengers in strength and power greater being, not bring against them from Lord a railing judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>these but, like irrational animals, natural, having been made for capture and slaughter, in which things they do not understand reviling, in the corruption of them they will be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>receiving a reward of unrighteousness; a pleasure esteeming the in day luxury, spots and stains, revelling in the deceptions of themselves, feasting together with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>eyes having full of an adulteress and unrestrained from sin, alluring souls unstable, a heart having been trained for covetousness having, of a curse children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>having left a straight way, they wandered, having followed in the way of the Balaam of the Bosor, who a reward of unrighteousness loved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>a reproof but he had of his own transgression; a beast of burden dumb, with of man a voice having spoken, restrained the of the prophet madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are fountains without water, and fogs by a whirlwind being driven; for which the gloom of the darkness for an age has been kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>Swellings for of folly speaking they allure by lusts of flesh, by impurities, those scarcely having fled away from those in error living;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>freedom to them promising themselves slaves being of the corruption; by what for any one has been over come, by this also he has been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>If for having fled away from the pollution of the world by a knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Anointed, with these and again having been entangled they are overcome, has become to them the things last worse of the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>Better for it was for them, not to have known the way of the righteousness, than having known to have turned back from the having been delivered to them holy commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>It has happened but to them the of the true proverb: A dog having turned back to the own vomit; and: A hog having been washed, to a rollingplace of mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This now, beloved ones, second to you I write a letter, in which I stir up of you by a remembrance the sincere mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to be mindful of the having been spoken before words by the holy prophets, and of the of the apostles of us commandment of the Lord and savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>this first knowing, that will come in last of the days with scoffing scoffers, according to the own lusts of themselves walking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying: Where is the promise of the presence of him? from of which for the fathers feel asleep, all things thus remains from a beginning of creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>It escapes notice for them this being willing, that heavens were of old, and earth out of water and through water having been placed together, by the of the God word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by means of which things the then world by water having been deluged was destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>the but now heavens and the earth by the him word having been treasured up are, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>One but this not let escape you, beloved ones, that one day with Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a day one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>Not is slow the Lord of the promise, as some slowness account; but is longsuffering towards us not desiring some to perish, but all for a reformation to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>Will come but the day of Lord as a thief, in which the heavens with a rushing sound will pass away, elements and burning intensely will be dissolved, and earth and all in her works will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Of these things therefore all being dissolved, what ones it behooves to be you in holy conduct and piety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and hastening the presence of the of the God day, on account of which heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and elements burning intensely melts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>New but heavens and earth new according to the promise of him we look for, in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved ones, these things looking for, do you diligently endeavor spotless and blameless by him to be found in peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>and the of the Lord of us longsuffering, salvation do you reckon; as also the beloved of us brother Paul according to the to him having been given wisdom wrote to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all the letters, speaking in them concerning these; in which is hardly understood some things, which those unlearned and unstable distort, as also the remaining writings, to the own of themselves destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, beloved ones, knowing before, be you on guard, so that not by the of the lawless ones deceit having been led away, you may fall from the own stability;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>grow you but in favor and knowledge of the Lord of us and Savior Jesus Anointed. To him the glory both now and to a day of an age; so be it.</verse>
