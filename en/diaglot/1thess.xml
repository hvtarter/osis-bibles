The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brethren beloved by God, the election of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because the glad tidings of us not came to you in word only, but also in power, even with spirit holy, and with confirmation much; as you know what we were among you on account of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you imitators of us became and of the Lord, having received the word in affliction much with joy of spirit holy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that to have become you patterns to all to those believing in the Macedonia and in the Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>From you for has been sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in the Macedonia and in the Achaia, but also in every place the faith of you that towards the God has gone forth; so that not necessary us to have to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>Themselves for congregation us declare, what kind introduction we had to you, and how you turned to the God from the idols, to serve God living and true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for the son of him from the heavens, whom he raised out of the dead ones, Jesus, the one delivering us from the wrath of that coming.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having previously suffered and having been injuriously treated, as you know, in Philippi, we were emboldened by the God of us to speak to you the glad tidings of the God with much striving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>The for exhortation of us not from error, nor from impurity, nor in deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as we have been approved by the God to be entrusted with the glad tidings, so we speak, not as men pleasing, but the God that one trying the hearts of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>Neither for any time with a word of flattery did we come, as you know; nor with a pretence of covetousness, God a witness;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so, being very desirous of you, we were wellpleased to have imparted to you not only the glad tidings of the God, but also the of yourselves lives, because beloved ones to us you have become.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and testifying in order that to walk you worthily of the God, of the one calling you for the of himself kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>On account of this also we give thanks to the God unceasingly, because receiving a word of hearing from us of the God, you received, not a word of men, but, as it is truly, a word of God, which also inworks in you the believing ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>You for imitators became, brethren, of the congregations of the God of those being in the Judea in Anointed Jesus, because the things same you suffered also you by the own countrymen, as also they by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>of those also the Lord having killed Jesus and the prophets, and us persecuted, and God not pleasing, and to all men contrary;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to the Gentiles to speak that they might be saved, in order that to have filled up of themselves the sins always. Has come but on them the wrath for an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>We but, brethren, having been bereaved from you for a season an hour, in face, not a heart, more earnestly we endeavored the face of you to see with much desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we wished to come to you. (I indeed Paul,) even once and twice; and the thwarted us the Adversary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>you for are the glory of us and the joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore no longer holding out, we thought well to be left in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and we sent Timothy, the brother of us and fellowworker of the God in the glad tidings of the Anointed, in order that to confirm you and to exhort you in behalf of the faith of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one to be shaken by the afflictions these; (yourselves, for you know, that for this we are placed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>indeed for when with you we were, we previously said to you, that we are about to be afflicted, even as also it happened and you know;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>on account of this also I no longer holding out, I sent in order the to know the faith of you lest perhaps tempted you the tempter, and in vain should become the toil of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>Just now but, having come Timothy to us from you, and having brought glad tidings to us the faith and the love of you, and because you have remembrance of us good always, longing us to see, even as also we you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>through this we were comforted, brethren, over you in all the affliction and distress of us, on account of the of you faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>because now we live, if you stand firm in Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>What for gratitude are we able to the God to return concerning you, for all the joy with which we rejoice on account of you in presence of the God of us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day more exceedingly entreating for the to see of you the face, and to supply the things wanting of the faith of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Himself but the God and Father of us, and the Lord of us Jesus Anointed may direct the way of us to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>you but the Lord cause to be full and to overthrow with the love to each other and to all, even as also we to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>in order that to be established of you the hearts blameless in holiness in presence of the God even a Father of us, at the coming of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed with all of the holy ones of himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally therefore, brethren, we entreat you and we exhort in Lord Jesus, as you received from us the how it behooves you to walk and to please God, so that you may abound more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>you know for, what commands we gave to you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>This for is will of the God, the sanctification of you; to abstain you from the fornication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>to have known each one of you the of himself vessel to possess in satisfaction and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in passion of inordinate desire, as even the Gentiles those not knowing the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that not to overstep and cheat in the matter the brother of himself; because an avenger the Lord concerning all these things, as also we before said to you and fully testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>Not for did call us the God for impurity, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore the one setting aside, not man sets aside, but the God, that also having given the spirit of himself the holy to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>Concerning but the brotherly love, no need you have to write to you; yourselves for you God taught are into the to love each other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>also for you do it to all the brethren those in whole the Macedonia. We exhort but you, brethren, to abound more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to strive earnestly to be quiet, and to do the things your own, and to work with the own hands of you, as to you we commanded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>so that you walk becomingly towards those outside, and of nothing need may have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Not we wish but you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those having fallen asleep, so that not you may grieve, as even the others those not having a hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>If for we believe, that Jesus died and arose, so and the God those having slept through the Jesus will lead out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>This for to you we may say by word of Lord, that we the living ones those being left over to the coming of the Lord, not not may precede those having slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Because himself the lord with a command, with a voice of a chief messenger, and with a trumpet of God will come down from heaven, and the dead ones in Anointed will be raised first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>afterwards we the living ones those being left over at the same time with them shall be caught away in clouds for a meeting of the Lord into air; and so always with Lord shall we be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Therefore comfort you each other in the words these.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>Concerning but the times and the seasons, brethren, no need you have to you to be written;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>yourselves for accurately you know, that the day of Lord, as a thief in night, so comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they may say: Peace and safety; then sudden to them is at hand destruction, just as the birthpang to her in womb having; and not not can they escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>You but, brethren, not are in darkness, that the day you as a thief should come upon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>all for you sons of light are and sons of day; not we are of night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>So then not we may sleep, as even the others, but we should watch and we should not drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>those for sleeping, of night they sleep; and those getting drunk, of night they get drunk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>We but, of day being, should not drink, having put on a breastplate of faith and of love, and a helmet, a hope of salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>because not did set us the God for wrath, but for attaining of salvation by means of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>of that having died on behalf of us; so that, whether we may be awake or we may be asleep, together with him we may live.</verse>
