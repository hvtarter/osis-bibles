The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that the proof of you of the faith much more precious of gold of that perishing, by means of fire but being proved, may be found to praise and honor and glory, at a revelation of Jesus Anointed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it has been written: Holy ones become you, because I holy am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be you subject therefore to every human creation on account of the Lord; whether to a king, as being preeminent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as by means of him being sent for punishment of evildoers, praise but of gooddoers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>(because thus it is the will of the God, welldoing to muzzle the of the unwise of men ignorance;)</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>The household servants, being submissive with all fear to the masters, not only to the good ones and gentle ones, but also to the perverse ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>This for pleasing, if through a conscience of God bears up under any one griefs, suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>What for credit, if sinning and being beaten you shall endure? but if doing good and suffering you shall endure, this pleasing with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>To this for you were called; because even Anointed suffered on behalf of you, to you leaving behind an example, so that you may follow in the steps of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who sin not did, nor was found guile in the mouth of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who being reviled not reviled again, suffering not he threatened, delivered himself up but to the one judging righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who the sins of us himself carried up in the body of himself to the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; of whom by the scars of him you were healed.</verse>
