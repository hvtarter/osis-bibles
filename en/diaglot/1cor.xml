The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called an apostle of Jesus Anointed, through will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the congregation of the God to that being in Corinth, having been sanctified in Anointed Jesus, called saints with all those calling upon the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed in every place, of them both and of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>favor to you and peace from God Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to the God of me always concerning you, for the favor of the God for that having been given to you in Anointed Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in every thing you were enriched in him, in every word and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>(when the testimony of the Anointed was confirmed among you;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you not to be inferior in any one gracious gift, waiting for the revelation of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who also will confirm you to an end irreproachable ones in the day of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>Faithful the God, through whom you were called into fellowship of the son of him Jesus Anointed, the Lord of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>I entreat and you, brethren, through the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, that the same thing you speak all, and not may be among you divisions, you may be but knit together in the same mind and in the same sentiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>It was declared for to me concerning you, brethren of me, by those of Chloe, that contentions among you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>I say and this, because each one of you says: I indeed am of Paul; I but, of Apollos; I and, of Cephas; I and, of Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has been divided the Anointed? not Paul was crucified on behalf of you? or into the name of Paul were you dipped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks to the God, that no one of you I dipped, if not Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that not any one may say, that into the my name I dipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I dipped and also the Stephanas house; remainder not I know, if any other I dipped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>Not for sent me Anointed to dip, but to announce glad tidings; not in wisdom of speech, so that not may be of no effect the cross of the Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>The word for that of the cross to those indeed being destroyed foolishness is, to those but being saved to us power of God it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>It has been written for: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the learning of the intelligent ones I will set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where a wise man? where a scribe? where a disputer of the age this? Not did make foolish the God the wisdom of the world this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>When for in the wisdom of the God not knew the world through the wisdom the God, was pleased the God, through the foolishness of the proclamation to save those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Although and Jews signs are asking, and Greeks wisdom are seeking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>we yet proclaim an Anointed having been crucified, to Jews indeed a stumblingblock, to Gentiles and foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>to those but to the called ones, Jews both and Greeks, Anointed of God power and of God wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of the God, wiser of the man is; and the weakness of the God, stronger of the men is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>You see for the calling of you, brethren, that not many wise ones according to flesh, not many strong ones, not many wellborn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but the foolish things of the world chose the God, that the wise ones he may shame; and the weak things of the world chose the God, that he may shame the powerful ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and the lowborn of the world and the things having been despised chose the God, and the things not existing, that the things existing he may bring to nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that not may boast all flesh in presence of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>Out of him but you are in Anointed Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness also and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that, even as it has been written: He boasting, in Lord let him boast.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I having come to you, brethren, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>Not for I determined any thing to make known among you, if not Jesus Anointed, and this having been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I in weakness, and in fear and in trembling much was with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and the speech of me and the preaching of me not in persuasive wisdom of words, but in a display of spirit and of power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>so that the faith of you not may be in wisdom of men, but in power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Wisdom but we speak among the perfect ones. Wisdom but not of the age this, nor of the rulers of the age this, of those coming to an end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak of God wisdom in a mystery, that having been hidden, which previously marked out the God before the ages, for glory of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which no one of the rulers of the age this has known; (if for they knew, not would the Lord of the glory they crucified;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but, even as it has been written: What things eye now saw, and ear not heard, and to heart of man not ascended, what prepared the God for those loving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>To us but revealed the God through the spirit of himself; the for spirit all things searches, even the depths of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>Who for knows of men the things of the men, if not the spirit of the man that in him? so also the things of the God no one knows, if not the spirit of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>We but not the spirit of the world received, but the spirit that from God, that we may know the things by the God having been graciously given to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which things also we speak, not by teachings of human wisdom in words, but by teachings of spirit, to spiritual ones spiritual things explaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>An animal but man not receives the things of the spirit of the God; foolishness for to him it is, and not he is able to know; because spiritually it is examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>The but spiritual man examines indeed all things, himself but by no one is examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>Who for knew mind of Lord, who will instruct him? We but mind of Anointed have.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, not was able to speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly ones, even as to babes in Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>Milk you I gave to drink, not solid food; not yet were you able. But not even yet now are you able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>yet for fleshly ones you are. Where for among you envy and strife and divisions, not fleshly ones you are, and according to man walk you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>When for may say any one: I indeed am of Paul; another and: I, of Apollos; not fleshly ones are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, who and Apollos? Servants, through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but the God caused to grow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>so neither he planting is anything, nor he watering, but he causing to grow God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>He planting but and he watering one are; each and the own reward will receive according to the own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>Of God for we are fellowworkers; of God a farm, of God a building you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the favor of the God that having been given to me, as a wise architect a foundation I have laid; another but builds up; each one but let see, how he builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>Foundation for another no one is able to have laid besides that being laid, who is Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>If but any one builds on the foundation this gold, silver, stones costly, wood, hay, straw;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>of each one the work manifest shall become; the for day will show, because in fire it is revealed; and of each one the work what kind it is, the fire will try.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If of any one the work abides which he built up, a reward he will receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>if of any one the work shall be consumed, he will suffer loss; he himself but shall be saved, in this way but as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Not know you, that a temple of God you are, and the spirit of the God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one the temple of the God destroys, will destroy him the God; the for temple of the God holy is, who ever are you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>No one himself let deceive; if any one seems wise to be among you in the age this, a fool let him become, so that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>The for wisdom of the world this, foolish with the God is; it has been written for: He is catching the wise ones in the craftiness of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again: Lord knows the reasonings of the wise ones, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore no one let boast in men; all things for of you is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or world, or life, or death, or present things, or being about to be; all things of you is;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>you and, of Anointed; Anointed and, of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Thus us let regard a man, as assistants of Anointed, and stewards of mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>What but remaining, it required in the stewards, that faithful one should be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>To me but for least thing it is, that by you I should be condemned, or by a human day; but not even myself do I condemn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>(nothing for in myself I am conscious, but not in this I have been justified;) he but condemning me, Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore not before proper season any thing judge you, till may come the Lord, who both will bring to light the things hidden of the darkness, and will make manifest the purposes of the hearts; and then the praise shall be to each one from the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>These and, brethren, I figuratively applied to myself and Apollos on account of you, that by us you may learn that not above what has been written to think, so that not one on behalf of the one you may be puffed up against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>Who for thee distinguishes? what and hast thou, which not thou didst receive? if and also thou didst receive, why dost thou boast as not having received?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already having been filled you are, already you were rich, without us you reigned; and I wish indeed you did reign, no that also we with you might reign together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>I think for that the God us the apostles last set forth, as appointed to death, because a spectacle we were made to the world and messengers and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We fools on account of Anointed, you but wise ones in Anointed; we weak ones, you but strong ones; you honorable ones, we but ignoble ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Till the present hour both we hunger, and we thirst, and we are naked, and we are beaten, and we are homeless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we labor working with the own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being blasphemed, we exhort; as purgations of the world we became, of all things offscraping till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not shaming you I write these things, but as children of me beloved I admonish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>If for myriads childtenders you may have in Anointed, but not many fathers; in for Anointed Jesus through the glad tidings I you begot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I exhort therefore you, imitators of me become you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>On account of this I sent you Timothy who is a child of me beloved and faithful in Lord, who you will remind the ways of me those in Anointed, even as every where in every congregation I teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>As not coming but of me to you, were puffed up some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>I will come but quickly to you, if the Lord should will, and I will know not the word of those having been puffed up, but the power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>not for in word the kingdom of the God, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you wish? with a rod I should come to you, or in love in a spirit and of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>Actually is heard among you fornication, and such fornication, which not even among the Gentiles, as a wife one of the father to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you having been puffed up are? and not rather lamented, so that might be removed from midst of you he the work this having done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>I indeed for as being absent in the body, being present but in the spirit, already have judged as being present, him thus this having practiced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed (having been assembled of you and of the my spirit,) with the power of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver up that one to the adversary for destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Not good the boasting of you. Not know you, that a little leaven whole the mass leavens?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be new mass, as you are unleavened; even for the paschal lamb of us on behalf of us was slain, Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with leaven old, nor with leaven of vice and wickedness, but with unleavened things of sincerity and of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in the letter, not to be associated with fornicators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>And not altogether with the fornicators of the world this, or with the covetous ones, or extortioners, or idolaters; since you are bound indeed from the world to come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>Now but I wrote you, not to be associated, if any one, a brother being named, may be a fornicator, or a covetous person, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with the such like not even to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>what for to me also those without to judge? Not those within you judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>Those but without the God will judge. Put out the evil one from of yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any one of you, a matter having with the other, to be judged by the unjust ones, and not by the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or not know you, that the saints the world will judge? and if by you is judged the world, inadequate are you for tribunals smallest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>not know you, that messengers we shall judge? much more then things of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>Things of this life indeed then judgments if you may have, those having been no account in the congregation, those do you cause to sit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>For shame to you I speak; thus not one among you wise not even one, who shall be able to decide between the brethren of himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but a brother with brother is judged, and this by unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already indeed then certainly a fault to you it is, that lawsuits you have with yourselves. Why not rather suffer injustice? why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you injure, and defraud, and these things brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or not know you, that unjust ones of God a kingdom not shall inherit? Not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminates, nor Sodomites,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And these things some you were; but you washed yourselves, but you were separated, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, an in the spirit of the God of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things to me is lawful, but not all things is beneficial; all things to me it lawful, but not I will be brought to subjection by any one.</verse>
