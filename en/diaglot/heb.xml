The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In many parts and in many ways long ago the God having spoken to the fathers by the prophets, in last of the days of these spoke to us by a son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>whom he appointed an heir of all things, (on account of whom also the ages he made,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who (being an effulgence of the glory and an exact impress of the substance of him, sustaining and the things all by the word of the power of himself,) through himself a purification have made of the sins of us, sat down at right of the majesty in high places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>by so much greater having become of them messengers, by so much more excellent beyond them he has inherited a name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>To which for did he say ever of the messengers: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee? and again: I will be to him for a Father, and he shall to me for a son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>when but again he may lead in the first born into the habitable, he says: And let worship him all messengers of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And concerning indeed the messengers he says: He making the messengers of himself spirits, and the public servants of himself of fire a flame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>concerning but the son: The throne of thee the god for the age of the ages; a sceptre of rectitude the sceptre of the kingdom of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou didst love righteousness, and thou didst hate lawlessness; on account of this anointed thee the God of thee, oil of extreme joy beyond the associates of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: Thou in a beginning, O Lord, the earth didst form, and works of the hands of thee are the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, thou but remainest; and all as a garment shall become old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like an upper garment thou wilt fold them, and they shall be changed; thou but the same art, and the years of thee not will fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which but of the messengers did he say ever: Do thou sit at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee footstool for the feet of thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Not all are public serving spirits, for service being sent forth on account of those being about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>On account of this it behooves more earnestly us to attend to the things having been heard, lest perhaps we should glide away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>If for the through messengers having been spoken word was firm, and every deviation and imperfect hearing received a just retribution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how we shall escape so great having disregarded a salvation? which a beginning having received to be spoken through the Lord, by those having heard for us was confirmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>coattesting the God by signs both and by prodigies, and by various powers, and of spirit holy by distributions, according to the of himself will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>Not for to messengers he did subject the habitable that about coming, concerning which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>Testified but somewhere one, saying: What is man, that thou dost remember him; or a son of man, that thou dost observe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst make less him a little while then messengers; with glory and with honor thou didst crown him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>all things thou didst place under the feet of him. In for the to be subjected to him the things all, nothing is left to him unsubjected; now but not yet we see to him the things all having been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>The but a short time than messengers having been made less we see Jesus on account of the suffering of the death with glory and with honor having been crowed; so that by favor of God on behalf of all he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>It was fitting besides for him, for whom the things all and through whom the things all, many sons into glory leading the prince of the salvation of them through sufferings to perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>He both for sanctifying and those being sanctified out of one all; for which cause not he is ashamed brethren them to call,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying: I will announce the name of thee to the brethren of me, in midst of a congregation I will praise thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: I will be having trusted in him; and again: Lo, I and the children which to me gave the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since then the children have been sharers of flesh and blood, also he in like manner partook of the of them, so that by means of the death he might make powerless him the strength having of the death, that is the accuser,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might set free them as many as by fear of death through all of the life held in were slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>Not for in any manner of messengers he takes hold, but of seed of Abraham he takes hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Hence he was obliged in all things to the brethren to be made like, so that merciful he might be and faithful highpriest the things as to the God, in order to the to expiate the sin of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>By what for he has suffered himself having been tried, he is able to those being tried to render aid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Whence, brethren holy, of a calling heavenly partakers do you attentively regard the apostle and highpriest of the profession of us, Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>faithful being to the one having appointed him, as even Moses in (whole) the house of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>Of more for this glory than Moses has been esteemed worthy, so fare as more honor he has of the house the one having built itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>(Every for house is built by some one; he but the things all having built, God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed faithful in whole to the house of him, as a servant, for a testimony of the things going to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>Anointed but, as a son over the house of him; of whom a house are we, if indeed the confidence and the boasting of the hope till end firm we should hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as says the spirit the holy: Today, if the voice of him you will hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>not you should harden the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of the temptation in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>not tempted me the fathers of you, proved me, and saw the works of me, forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>therefore I was provoked with the generation that, and said: Always they wander in the heart; they but not they acknowledged the ways me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>so I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take you heed, brethren, lest ever shall be in any one of you a heart evil of unbelief, in the to fall away from God living;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but do you exhort yourselves in each day, till of which the today it is called, so that not may be hardened from of you any one by a delusion of the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>Partakers for of the Anointed we have become, if perhaps the beginning of the confidence till an end firm we would hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>In respect to the to be said: Today, if the voice of him you may hear; not harden you the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Some for having heard did provoke? but not all those having come out from Egypt by means of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>With whom but was he vexed forty years? not with those having sinned? of whom the members fell in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>To whom but did he swear not to enter into the rest of himself, if not to those having disbelieved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see, that not they were able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We may fear then, lest ever, being left a promise to enter into the rest of him, should seem any one from you to have failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>Also for we were having been addressed with glad tidings, even as also they; but not did profit the word of the hearing them, not having seen been mixed with the faith to those hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>We enter for into the rest those having believed, as he has said: So I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me; namely from the works from a laying down of a world having been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>It has been spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh thus: And rested the God in the day the seventh from all of the works of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this again: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since then it is left some to enter into her, and those formerly having received glad tidings not entered on account of unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again certain he defines a day, Today by David, saying, after so long a time; (as it has been said;) Today, if the voice of him you may hear, not harden you the hearts of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>If for them Jesus caused to rest, not would concerning another have spoken after these of a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Therefore remains a keeping of a sabbath for the people of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>The for one having entered into the rest of him, also himself caused to rest from the works of himself, like as from the own the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>We should earnestly endeavor therefore to enter into that the rest, so that not by the same any one example may fail of the unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>Living for the word of the God, and energetic, and more cutting beyond every sword twomouthed, even cutting through to a division of life both and of breath, of joints both and of marrows, and able to judge of thoughts and of intentions of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>and not is a creature out of sight in presence of him, all things but naked and having been laid open to the eyes of him, with whom for us the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having therefore a highpriest great, having passed through the heavens, Jesus the son of the God, we should lay hold of the profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>Not for we have a highpriest not being able to suffer with the weaknesses of us, having been tempted but in all things according to a likeness, apart from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>We should come therefore with confidence to the throne of the favor, so that we may receive mercy, and favor we may find for seasonable help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>Every for highpriest from men having been taken, on behalf of men is placed over the things relating to the God, so that he may offer gifts both and sacrifices on behalf of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>to suffer a measure being able with the ignorant ones and erring ones, since also himself surrounds weakness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and on account of this it is fitting, as concerning the people, so also concerning himself to offer on behalf of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And not to himself any one takes the honor, but he being called by the God, as even Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus and the Anointed not himself did glorify to become a high priest, but the one having spoken to him: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as also in another he says: Thou a priest for the age, according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of the flesh of himself, prayers both and supplications to him being able to deliver him out of death, with a cry strong and tears having offered, and having been heard from the piety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>(though being a son, learned, from what things he suffered, the obedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and having been perfected he became to those obeying him to all a cause of salvation agelasting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been declared by the God a highpriest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Concerning whom great to us the word and hard to be explained to say, since sluggish ones you have become in the hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>Even for being obligated to be teachers on account of the time, again need you have of the to teach you, certain the elements of the beginning of the oracles of the God; and you have become need having of milk, and not of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>Every one for the partaking of milk, unskilled of a word of righteousness; a babe for he is;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>for perfect ones but is the solid food, for those by the habit the perceptions having been exercised having for a discrimination of good both and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore leaving the of the beginning of the Anointed word, towards the perfection we should progress; not again a foundation laying down for reformation from dead works, and of faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of dippings teaching, of laying on and of hands, of a resurrection and of dead ones, and of a judgment agelasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if may permit the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>Impossible for, those once having been enlightened, having tasted and of the gift of the heavenly, and partakers having become of spirit holy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and good having tasted of God word, powers and about coming of an age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, again to renew for reformation, having crucified again for themselves the son of the God and exposing to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>Earth for that having drunk the on her often coming rain, and producing herbage useful to them, for whom also it is tilled, receives a blessing from the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>producing but thorns and thistles, rejected and a curse near, of which the end for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>Having been persuaded but concerning you, beloved ones, the things better and being possessed of salvation, through even thus we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>Not for unjust the God, to be forgetful of the work of you and of the love, which you manifested for the name of him, having ministered to the holy ones and are ministering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>We desire but, each of you the same to show diligence for the full assurance of the hope till an end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>so that not sluggish ones you may become, imitators but of those through faith and long endurance are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>To the for Abraham having promised the God, since by no one he had greater to swear, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying: Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so having waited long he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>Men indeed for by the greater swear, and all to them contradiction and end for confirmation the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In which more abundantly wishing the God to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of the purpose of himself, interposed with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>so that by two transactions unalterable, in which impossible to deceive God, strong consolation we might have those having fled away to lay hold of the being placed before hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which as an anchor we have of the life sure both and firm, and entering into the within the vail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where a forerunner on behalf of us entered Jesus, according to the order of Melchizedek a highpriest having become for the age.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>This for the Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the God of the most high, (the one having met Abraham returning from the smiting of the kings and having blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also a tenth from of all divided Abraham,) first indeed being translated a king of righteousness, then and also a king of Salem, (which is, a king of peace,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without a father, without a mother, without a genealogy, neither a beginning of days nor of life an end having, having been made like but to the son of the God, remains a priest for the continuance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Consider you but, how great this, to whom even a tenth Abraham gave out of the choice spoils, the patriarch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And those indeed from the sons of Levi the priesthood receiving, a commandment have to tithe the people according to the law, this is, the brethren of them, though having come out of the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>he but not deriving an origin from them, has tithed the Abraham, and the one having the promises he has blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Without but all contradiction, the less by the greater is blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here indeed tithes dying men receives; there but, being testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And so a word to speak, through Abraham even Levi the tithes receiving has been tithed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>yet for in the loins of the father he was, when met him the Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If indeed then perfection through the Levitical priesthood was; (the people for with her law had received;) what yet need, according to the order of Melchizedek another to arise a priest, and not according to the order of Aaron to be named?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>Being changed for the priesthood, from necessity also of law a change occurs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>Concerning whom for is spoken these things, of a tribe another has been a partaker, from which no one has attended to the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>evident for, that from Juda has sprung the Lord of us, respecting which tribe nothing concerning priesthood Moses spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And more yet evident it is, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises a priest another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who not according to a law of a commandment fleshly has become, but according to a power of life enduring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>It testifies for: That thou a priest for the age according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>An abrogation indeed for takes places of a preceding commandment, on account of the her weakness and unprofitableness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(nothing for perfected the law;) after introduction but of a better hope, through which we draw near to the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And in as much as not without swearing; (they indeed for without swearing are priests having become;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>he but with swearing through the one saying to him: Swore a Lord, and not will change; Thou a priest for the age according to the order of Melchizedek;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much better a covenant has become a surety Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they indeed, many are having become priests, on account of the death to be hindered to continue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>he but, on account of the to continue him for the age, unchangeable he has the priesthood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>hence and to save for the completely is able those drawing near through him to the God, always living, in order to the interpose in behalf of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>Such for to us was proper a highpriest, holy, free from sin, unstained, having been separated from the sinners, and more exalted of the heavens having become;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who not has every day necessity, as the highpriests, first on behalf of the own sins sacrifices to offer, then for those of the people; this for he did at once, himself offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>The law for men appoints highpriests, having weakness; the word but of the swearing of that after the law, a son for to the age having been perfected.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>A head thing but to those being spoken, such we have a highpriest, who sat down at right of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>of the holy things a public servant, and of the tabernacle of the true, which fixed the Lord, and not man.</verse>
