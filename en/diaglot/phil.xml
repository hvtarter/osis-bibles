The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, bondmen of Jesus Anointed, to all the holy ones in Anointed Jesus, to those being in Philippi, with overseers and servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>favor to you and peace from God a Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed. Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I give thanks to the God of me on every the remembrance of you, Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every prayer of me on behalf of all of you, with joy the prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>making in respect to the fellowship of you for the glad tidings, from first day till the now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>having been persuaded same this thing, that the one having begun in you a work good, will complete till a day of Jesus Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>as it is just for me this to think concerning all of you, because the to have me in the hearts of you, in both the bounds of me and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings, jointcontributors of me of the free gift all of you being;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>a witness for of me is the God, how I long after all of you in bowels of Anointed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray that the love of you, yet more and more may abound in knowledge and in all perception;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>for the to examine you the things differing, so that you may be sincere ones and inoffensive ones for a day of Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>having been filled fruit of righteousness that through Jesus Anointed, to glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>To know but you I wish, brethren, that the things relating to me rather for advancement of the glad tidings happened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that the bonds of me appear in Anointed to have become before all in the judgment hall and to the others to all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and the greater number of the brethren in Lord, having been assured by the bonds of me, more abundantly are bold fearlessly the word to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed even through envy and strife, some and also through goodwill the Anointed they openly proclaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>These indeed from love, knowing, that for a defence of the gladtidings I am placed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>those but from strife, the Anointed are announcing not purely, thinking affliction to superadd to the bonds of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? still in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Anointed is announced; and in this I rejoice, but also I will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>I know for, that this to me will result for deliverance through the of you, entreaty, and a supply of the spirit of Jesus Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to the eager expectation and hope of me, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all confidence, as always, also now will be magnified Anointed in the body of me, whether by means of life or by means of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For me therefore the to live, Anointed, and the to die, gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>If but the to live in flesh, this to me a fruit of work, and what I shall choose, not I know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>I am hard pressed but by the two, the earnest desire having for the to be loosed again, and with Anointed to be; much for more better;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>the but to remain in the flesh, more necessary on account of you. Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And this having been persuaded I know, because I shall remain and I shall continue with all you for the of you progress and joy of the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that the boasting of you may abound by Anointed Jesus in me, through the my presence again with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only worthy of the glad tidings of the Anointed act you as citizens, so that, whether having come and having seen you, or being absent, I may hear the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul cooperating vigorously for the faith of the glad tidings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not being terrified in anything by those opposing; which is to them a token of destruction, to you but of salvation; and this from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>because to you it was given that on behalf of Anointed, not only that him to believe, but also that on behalf of him to suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>the same conflict having, a like thing you saw in me, and now you hear in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If any therefore comfort in Anointed, if any soothing of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and compassions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fulfil you of me the joy, so that the same thing you may think, the same love having, united ones in soul, the one thing minding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>nothing in strife or vainglory, but in the lowliness of mind others esteeming exceeding yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>not the things of yourselves each one regarding, but also the things of others everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>This for be desired by you which also in Anointed Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who in a form of God being, not a usurpation meditated the to be like to God, Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but himself emptied, a form of a slave having taken, in a likeness of men having been formed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and in condition being found as a man; humbled himself, having become obedient till death, of a death even of a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore also the God him supremely exalted, and freely granted to him a name that above every name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of heavenlies and of earthlies and of underground ones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue should confess, that a Lord Jesus Anointed, for glory of God a Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So that, beloved ones of me, as always you obeyed, not as in the presence of me only, but now much more in the absence of me, with fear and trembling the of yourselves salvation work you out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>the God for it is the one working in you both the to will and the to work, on account of the goodpleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>All things do you without murmurings and disputings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may be blameless ones and harmless ones, children of God irreproachable in midst of a generation perverse and having been misguided; to which you appear as luminaries in world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>a word of life holding out; for a boast to me in a day of Anointed, that not in vain I ran, nor in vain I toiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But if even I am poured out on the sacrifice and public service of the faith of you, I am glad and I rejoice with all you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>the and same also you be you glad, and rejoice you with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>I hope but in Lord Jesus, Timothy shortly to send to you, that also I may be animated having ascertained the things concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>No one for I have likesouled, who really the things concerning you will care; Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>the all for the things of themselves are seeking, not the things of Jesus Anointed. Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>The but proof of him you know, that, as with a father a child, with me be served for the glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him indeed therefore I hope to send, as I would view attentively the things concerning me, immediately;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>having confidence and in Lord, that even myself shortly will come. Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Necessary but I esteemed, Epaphroditus the brother and fellowworker and fellowsoldier of me, of you but an apostle, and publicservant of the want of me, to have sent to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since longing after he was all you, and being depressed, because you heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Indeed for he was sick near to death; but the God him pitied not him and only, but also me, so that not sorrow on sorrow I should have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>More speedily therefore I sent him, that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I less sorrowful may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive you therefore him in Lord with all joy, and the such like ones in honor hold you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because on account of the work of the Anointed even to death he was near, having risked the life, so that he might fill up the of you deficiency of towards me public service.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>The thing remaining, brethren of me rejoice you in Lord; the things same to write to you, to me indeed not tedious, of you but safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>See you the dogs, see you the evil workers, see you the excision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>We for we are the circumcision, who in spirit God are serving, and boasting in Anointed Jesus, and not in flesh having been trusting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I having confidence also in flesh. If any thinks other to have confidence in flesh, I more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>with a circumcision eighthday, from race of Israel, of tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew from Hebrews, according to law a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>according to zeal persecuting the congregation, according to righteousness that by law having come blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things was to me gain, these things I have esteemed on account of the Anointed loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>But indeed then even I esteem all things a loss to be on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Anointed Jesus the Lord of me, (on account of whom the all things I suffered loss, and I esteem worthless things to be, so that Anointed I may gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and may be found in him, not holding my righteousness that from of law, but that through faith of Anointed, that from God a righteousness on account of the faith;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>of the to know him, and the power of the resurrection of him, and the fellowship of the sufferings of him, being conformed to the death of himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if possibly I may attain to the resurrection out of the dead ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that already I received, or already have been perfected; I pursue but, if indeed I may lay hold, in respect to which also I was laid hold of by Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I myself not reckon to have laid hold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>one but, the things even behind forgetting, the things but before stretching out to, according to a mark I pursue towards the prize of the above calling of the God in Anointed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>As many as then mature ones, this should mind; and if in anything differently you think, even this thing the God to you will reveal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>but to what we attained, by the same to walk in line.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Joint imitators of me become you, brethren, and watch you those thus walking, as you have a pattern us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>Many for walk, whom often I said to you, now and even weeping I say, the enemies of the cross of the Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>of whom the end destruction, of whom the God the belly, and the glory in the shame of them, who the things on earth are minding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>Of us for the commonwealth in heavens begins, out of which also a savior we look for Lord Jesus Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform the body of the humiliation of us of like form with the body of the glory of him, according to the operation of the to be able him even to place under himself the things all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, brethren of me beloved ones and ones longed for, joy and crown of me, thus stand you firm in Lord, O beloved ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, the same thing to mind in Lord; Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>yes I ask also thee, yokefellow O true, help thou these women, who in the glad tidings cooperated earnestly with me, with and Clement and the remaining fellowworkers of me, of whom the names in book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice you in Lord always; again I say, rejoice you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>The gentleness of you let be known to all men. The Lord near; Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>nothing be you overcareful, but in everything by the prayer and by the supplication with thanksgiving the requests of you let be made known to the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>and the peace of the God that surpassing all conception, will guard the hearts of you and the minds of you in Anointed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>The remaining, brethren, what things is, true, what things honorable, what things just, what things pure, what things amiable, what things of good report, if any virtue and if any praise, these things attentively consider;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>what things also you learned and you received, and you heard and you saw in me, these things perform you; and the God of the peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>I rejoiced and in Lord greatly, because now at length you revived the on behalf of me to think; on which also you were thinking, were without opportunity but.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not because respecting want I speak; I for learned, in what things I am, contented to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both to be brought low, I know and to abound; in every thing and in all things I have been initiated, both to be wellfed and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>all things I am strong in the one strengthening me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>But well you did, having jointly sympathized with me in the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You know and also you, O Philippians, that in a beginning of the glad tidings, when I went out from Macedonia, no one with me congregation communicated in an account of giving and receiving, if not you only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>that and in Thessalonica even once and again for the need to me you sent. Phillippians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not because I earnestly seek the gift, but I earnestly seek the fruit that increasing for an account to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>I have in full but all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a smell of good odor, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to the God.</verse>
