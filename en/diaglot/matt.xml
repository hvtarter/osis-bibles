The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>The and Jesus being born in Bethleem of the Judea, in days of Herod the king, lo, wiseman from an east country came into Jerusalem, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is the newborn king of the Jews? we saw for of him the star in the rising, and are come to do homage of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>Having heard and Herod the king was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and having called together all the chiefpriests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Anointed should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They and said to him: In Bethleem of the Judea; thus for is written by the prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethleem, land of Juda; by no means least art among the princes of Juda; out of thee for shall come forth a prince, who shall govern the people of me, the Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod privately having called the wisemen, learned exactly from them the time of the appearing a star,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and sending them into Bethleem, he said: Passing on your way, exactly inquire about the infant; as soon as and you have found, bring word to me, that I also going pay homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>They and having heard the king departed. And lo, the star, which they saw in the rising, went before them, till going it stood over where was the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Seeing and the star, they rejoiced a joy very great;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and being come into the house, they saw the infant with Mary the mother of it, and falling down did homage to it, and opening the treasuries of them, they offered to it gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, by another way they withdrew into the country of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Having withdrawn but of the, lo, a messenger of a Lord appears in a dream to the Joseph, saying: Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there, till I speak to thee; is about for Herod to seek the infant, to kill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>He then arising took the infant and the mother of it by night, and went into Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and he was there till the death of Herod; that might be fulfilled the word spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt I called the son of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod seeing that he was mocked by the wisemen, was enraged much; and sending forth he slew all the boys the in Bethleem and in all the borders of her, from two years and under, according to the time which he exactly learnt from the wisemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled the word spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and weeping and mourning great; Rachel bewailing the children of her; and not is willing to be comforted because not they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Having died and of the Herod, lo, a messenger of a Lord in a dream appears to the Joseph in Egypt, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and go thou into land Israel; they are dead for the seeking the life of the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>He and arising took the infant and the mother of it, and came into land Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>Hearing and, that Archelaus was reigning over the Judea instead of Herod the father of him, he was afraid there to go; being warned and in a dream, he withdrew into regions of the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And coming he dwelt into a city named Nazareth; that might be fulfilled the words spoken through the prophets, that a Nazarene he will be called.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In now the days those comes John the dipper, proclaiming in the desert of the Judea, and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>Reform ye; has come nigh for the majesty of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>This for is he spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying: A voice crying out in the desert; make you ready the way of a Lord, straight make ye the beaten tracks of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>He and the John had the outer garment of him from hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him; the and food of him was locusts and honey wild.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all the Judea, and all the country about of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were dipped into the Jordan by him, confessing the sins of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>Seeing and many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the dipping of him, he said to them: O broods of venomous serpents, who pointed out to you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth then fruit worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and not think to say in yourselves: A father we have the Abraham; I say for to you, that is able the God out of the stones these to raise up children to the Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Now and even the axe to the root of the trees lies; every therefore tree not bearing fruit good, is cut down, and into a fire cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed dip you in water, into reformation; he but after of me coming, mightier of me is, of whom not I am worthy the sandals to carry; he you will dip in spirit holy and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Of whom the winnowing shovel in the hand of him, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing floor of him; and he will gather the wheat of him into the storehouse, the but chaff he will burn up in fire inextinguishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes the Jesus from the Galilee to the Jordan to the John, of the to be dipped by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>The but John refused him saying: I need to have by thee to be dipped, and thou comest to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Answering and the Jesus said to him: Permit now; thus for coming it is to us, to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having dipped the Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, were opened to him the heavens, and was seen the spirit of the God descending like a dove, and coming on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then the Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit, to be tempted by the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And fasting days forty and nights forty, after he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And coming to him the temper, said: If a son thou be of the God, speak, that the stones these loaves may become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>He but answering said: It is written: Not by bread alone shall live a man; but by every word proceeding from mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then takes him the accuser into the holy city, and places him on the wing of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and saying to him: if a son thou be of the God, cast thyself down; it is written for: That to the messengers of him he will give charge of thee; and on hands they shall raise thee, lest thou strikes against a stone the foot of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Said to him the Jesus: Again it is written: Not thou shalt put to the proof Lord the God of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again takes him the accuser into a mountain high exceedingly, and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and says to him: These all to thee I will give, if falling down thou wilt do homage to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then says to him the Jesus: Go thou behind of me, adversary; it is written for: Lord the God of thee thou shalt worship, and to him only thou shalt render service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then leaves him the accuser; and lo, messengers came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Hearing now the Jesus, that John was delivered up, he withdrew into the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And having left the Nazareth, coming dwelt at Capernaum the by the seaside, in borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that might be fulfilled the word spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zabulon and land Nephthalim way of the sea by the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who are sitting in darkness saw a light great; and to those sitting in a region even a shade of death, a light has arisen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began the Jesus to proclaim, and to say: Reform; has come nigh for the royal dignity of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon the called Peter, and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishingnet into the sea; they were for fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he says to them: Come behind of me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They and immediately leaving the nets, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers, James the of the Zebedee and John the brother of him in the ship with Zebedee of the father of them, mending the nets of them; and called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They and forthwith leaving the ship and the father of them, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And went about all the Galilee the Jesus, teaching in the synagogues of them, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And went the report of him into all the Syria; and they brought to him all the sick having, various diseases and torments seized with, and demoniacs, and lunaties, and paralytics; and he cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And followed to him crowds great from the Galilee, and Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing and the multitudes, he went up to the mountain; and having seated himself, came to him the disciples of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and opening the mouth of him, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed the poor to the spirit; because of them is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed the hungering and thirsting the righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed the clean to the heart, for they the God shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed the peacemakers, for they sons of God shall be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed those being persecuted on account of righteousness, for of them is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye, whenever they reproach you and persecute, and say every evil word against you, speaking falsely, because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice ye and exult ye, for the reward of you great in the heavens; in this way for they persecuted the prophets those before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth. If but the salt become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? for nothing is it of service any more, except to be cast out, and trodden under foot by the men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. Not possible a city to hide upon a hill being situated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor they light a lamp, and place him under the measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all those in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus let it shine the light of you in the presence of the men, that they may see of you the good works, and may praise the Father of you that in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Not think ye, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; not I have come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>Indeed for I say to you, till pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one or one fine point in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore breaks one of the commandments of these of the least, and teach thus the men, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens; who but ever shall do and teach, the same great shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>I say for to you that except abound the righteousness of you more of the scribes and Pharisees, by no means you may enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou kill; who ever shall kill, liable shall be to the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>I but say to you, that all the being angry to the brother of him, without cause, liable shall be to the tribunal: who and ever shall say to the brother of him, Vile fellow, liable shall be to the Sanhedrim; who and ever shall say: O fool, liable shall be to the Gehenna of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore thou bring the gift of thee of the altar and there remember, that the brother of thee has somewhat against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there the gift of thee before the altar, and go, first be thou reconciled to the brother of thee, and then coming offer the gift of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be thou willing to agree with the opponent of thee quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest thee deliver up the opponent to the judge, and judge thee deliver up to the officer, and into prison thou shalt be cast.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>I but say to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except on account of fornication, makes her to commit adultery; and whoever her being divorced, may marry, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again you have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou shall swear falsely; shalt perform but to the Lord the oaths of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>I but say to you not swear at all; not even by the heaven, for a throne it is of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for a footstool it is of the feet of him; neither by Jerusalem, for a city it is of the great king;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>Let be but the word of you; yes yes; no no; that for over and above of these, of the evil is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard, that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>I but say to you, not resist the evil; but whoever thee shall slap upon the right of thee cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and to the purposing thee to sue at law, and the tunic of thee to take, give up to him also the mantle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and whoever thee shall force to go mile one, go with him two.</verse>
