The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Anointed, called an apostle, having been set apart for glad tidings of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which he promised before through the prophets of himself in writings holy,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning the son of himself, (that having been born from a seed of David according to flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>that having been distinctly set forth a son of God in power, according to spirit of holiness, from a resurrection of dead ones,) Jesus Anointed of the Lord of us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>(through whom we received favor and apostleship for obedience of faith in all the nations, in behalf of the name of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom are also you, called ones of Jesus Anointed;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>to all those who are in Rome beloved ones of God called saints; favor to you and peace from God Father of us, and Lord Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First indeed I give thanks to the God of me through Jesus Anointed on account of all of you, because the faith of you is celebrated in whole the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>A witness for of me is the God, to whom I am a servant in the spirit of me in the glad tidings of the son of him, how unceasingly remembrance of you I make,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always on the prayers of me asking, if possibly now at length I shall have a prosperous journey by the will of the God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>I long for to see you, that some I may impart gift to you spiritual, for the to be established you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>this and is, to be comforted together, among you through the in each other faith, of you and also of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Not I wish but you to be ignorant, brethren, that many times I purposed to come to you, (and was hindered till the present,) that some fruit I might have also among you, as even among the other nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>to Greeks both and to barbarians, to wise ones both and to simple ones a debtor I am;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>thus, that according to me, I am eager even to you to those in Rome to announce glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>Not for I am ashamed the glad tidings; power for of God is for salvation to all to the believing, to Jew both first and to Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>Righteousness for of God in it is revealed from faith in order to faith, as it has been written: The and just by faith, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>Is revealed besides wrath of God from heaven on all impiety and injustice of men, of those the truth by injustice holding down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that known of the God manifest is among them; the God for to them showed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>(the things for unseen of him from creation of the world, in the things made being perceived is clearly seen, the both eternal of him power and deity;) in order that to be them inexcusable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because having known the God, not as God they glorified or they gave thanks; but were vain in the reasonings of them, and was darkened the perverse of them heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>asserting to be wise ones, they were foolish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God in a likeness of an image of corruptible man, and birds and of fourfooted beasts and creeping things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>There fore also delivered them the God in the lusts of the hearts of them to impurity, of the to be dishonored the bodies of them in themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who exchanged the truth of the God in the falsehood and reverenced and served the created thing more than him having created, who is worthy of praise into the ages; so be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>On account of this delivered them the God to passions of infamy. The even for females of them changed the natural use into that in violation of nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>In like manner and also the males having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed with the lust of them for for each other, males with males the indecency working out, and the recompence, which it was proper, of the error of them in themselves receiving back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as not they did try the God to have in knowledge, delivered them the God to a worthless mind, to do the things not fitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>having been filled with all iniquity, in wickedness, in covetousness, in malignity; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, bad disposition, whisperers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>revilers, Godhaters, insolent ones, proud ones, boasters, inventors of evils, to parent disobedient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>obstinate ones, covenantbreakers, unaffectionate ones, implacable ones, unmerciful ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who the ordinance of the God having known, (that those the things such doing worthy of death are,) not only them they do; but even are well pleased to those doing.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore inexcusable thou art, O man every one who art judging. In which for thou judgest the other, thyself thou condemnest; the things for same thou doest who art judging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know but, that the sentence of the God is according to truth upon those the things such doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Thinkest thou and this, O man who art judging those the things such doing, and art doing them, that thou shalt escape the sentence of the God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or of the wealth of the goodness of him and of the forbearance and of the patience thinkest thou wrong, being ignorant, that the goodness of the God to reformation thee leads?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>According to but the hardness of thee and unchanged heart, thou treasurest to thyself wrath in a day of wrath and of a revelation of righteous judgment of the God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will render to each according to the works of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those indeed by perseverance of a work good, glory and honor and incorruptibility are seeking, life agelasting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>to those but from a party spirit, and disobeying indeed the truth, obeying but the unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Affliction and distress on every soul of man of the working the evil, of Jew both first and of Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>glory but and honor and peace to every one the working the good, to Jew both first and to Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>Not for is respect of persons with the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>As many as for without law sinned, without law also shall perish; and as many as under law sinned, by law shall be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(not for the hearers of the law just ones with the God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When for Gentiles those not a law having, by nature the things of the law may do, these a law not having, to themselves are a law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show plainly the work of the law written in the hearts of them, testifying with them the conscience, and between each other of the reasonings accusing or even defending,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in a day when shall judge the God the things secrets of the men, according to the glad tidings of me, through Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>If but thou a Jew art named, and doest rest in the law, and doest boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and knowest the will, and discernest the things differing, being instructed out of the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>hast believed and thyself a guide to be of blind ones, a light of those in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of simple ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>The for name of the God through you is blasphemed among the nations, even as it has been written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision indeed for profits, if law thou practisest; if but a violator of law thou mayest be, the circumcision of thee uncircumcision has become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If therefore the uncircumcision the ordinances of the law may keep, not the uncircumcision of him for circumcision will be counted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>and will judge the from nature uncircumcision, the law perfecting, thee who through letter and circumcision a violator of law?</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then the preeminence of the Jew? or what the profit of the circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much, according to every mode. First indeed for, because they were entreated with the oracles of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>What for? if believed not some, not the unbelief of them the faith of the God will make void?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Not let it be; let it be but the God true, every but man a liar, even as it has been written: That thou mayest be justified in the words of thee, and mayest conquer in the to be judged thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>ruin and misery in the ways of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>and a way of peace not they knew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>Not is fear of God before the eyes of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>We know and, that what things the law says, to those under the law it speaks; that every mouth may be stopped, and liable to penalty may become all the world to the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore from works of law not shall be justified all flesh before him; through for law an acknowledgment of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>Now but without law a righteousness of God has been made manifest, being attested by the law and the prophets,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom set forth the God a mercyseat through the faith by the of him blood, for a pointing out of the righteousness of himself, through the passing by of the formerly committed sins in the forbearance of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>to a point out of the righteousness of himself in the present time, in order that to be him righteous, and justifying him of faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then the boasting? it is shut out. Through what kind of law? of the works? no, but through a law of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>we reckon for, to be justified by faith a man, without works of law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>On account of this from faith, so that according to favor; in order that to be sure the promise to all the seed, not to that from the law alone, but also to that from faith Abraham who is a father of all of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>even as it has been written: That a father of many nations I have placed thee;) in presence of whom he believed of God, of that making alive the dead ones, and calling the things not being as being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who contrary to hope in hope believed, in order that to have become him a father of many nations, (according to that having been spoken: Thus shall be the seed of thee;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>and not having grown weak in the faith, not he regarded the of himself body already having been deadened, an hundred years old thereabouts being, and the deadness of the womb of Sarah;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up on account of the offences of us, and was raised up on account of the justification of us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Having been justified therefore by faith, peace we have with the God through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>If for by the of the one fail the death reigned through the one, by much more those the abundance of the favor and of the gift of the righteousness having received, in life shall reign through one Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Indeed then as through one offence, on all men to condemnation; so also through one righteousness, on all men to a justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>As for through the disobedience of the one man sinners were constituted the many; so also through the obedience of the one righteous person shall be constituted the many.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What then shall we say? ought we to continue in the sin, so that the favor may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Not let it be. Who we died by the sin, how still shall we live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or are you ignorant, that as many as were dipped into Anointed Jesus, into the death of him were dipped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried together therefore with him through the dipping into the death, that as was raised up Anointed out of dead ones through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of life should walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>If for planted together we have become in the likeness of the death of him, certainly also of the resurrection we shall be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>this knowing, that the old of us man was crucified with, that might be rendered powerless the body of the sin, of the no longer to be enslaved us in the sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>he for having died has been justified from the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>If but we died with Anointed, we believe, that also we shall live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing, that Anointed having been raised out of dead ones, no longer dies; death of him no longer lords over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>Which for he died, by the sin he died once for all; which but he lives, he lives by the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So also you count yourselves dead ones indeed by the sin, living ones but by the God, in Anointed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Not therefore let reign the sin, in the mortal of you body, in order that to obey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>nor present you the members of you weapons of unrighteousness to the sin; but present you yourselves to the God, as out of dead ones living, and the members of you weapons of righteousness to the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>Sin for to you not shall lord over; not for you are under law, but under favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? shall we sin, because not we are under law, but under favor? Not let it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Not you know, that to whom you present yourselves slaves for obedience, slaves you are to whom you are obedient, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>Thanks but to the God, that you were slaves of the sin, you obeyed yet from heart into which you were delivered a form of teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Having been freed and from the sin, you were enslaved to the righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>(According to man I speak, on account of the weakness of the flesh of you.) As for you presented the members of you slaves to the uncleanness and to the iniquity for the iniquity; so now present you in members of you slaves to the righteousness for sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>When for slaves you were of the sin, free you were to the righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What therefore fruit had you then? in the things now you are ashamed; the for end of those, death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>Now but having been freed from the sin, having been enslaved and to the God, you have the fruit of you in sanctification; the and end, life agelasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>The for wages of the sin, death; the but gracious gift of the God, life agelasting in an Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or are you ignorant, brethren, (to those knowing for law I speak,) that the law lords over the man, for as long as a time he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>The for bound to a man woman to the living husband is bound by law; if but may die the husband, she is freed from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then living the husband an adulteress she will be called, if she should be to a man another; if but should die the husband, free she is from law, of the not to be her an adulteress, having become to a man another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore brethren of me, also you were put to death by the law through the body of the Anointed, in order that to become you to another, to him out of dead ones having been raised, so that we should bring forth fruit to the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>When for we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, those through the law, worked in the members of us, in order that to bring forth fruit to the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>Now but we were freed from the law, having died, in which we were held; so that to serve us in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What then shall we say? the law sin? Not let it be; but the sin not I knew, if not through law; the even for strong desire not I knew, if not the law said: Not thou shalt lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>Opportunity and having taken the sin, through the commandment worked out in me all strong desire; apart from for law sin dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>I and was alive apart from law then; having come but the commandment, the sin lived again, I and died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>and was found by me the commandment that for life, same for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>The for sin opportunity having taken, through the commandment deceived me, and through it killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that the indeed law holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>That then good thing, to me has become death? Not let it be; but the sin; so that it might appear sin, through the good to me working out death, so that might become in excess a sinner the sin through the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know for, that the law spiritual is; I but fleshly am, having been sold under the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>What for I work out, not I know; not for what I wish, this I practice; but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If but what not I wish, this I do, I assent to the law, that excellent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now but no longer I work out it, but the dwelling in me sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>I know for, that not dwells in me, this is in the flesh of me, a good thing; the for to will is present with me, the but to work out the excellent, not I find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>Not for what I wish, I do a good thing; but what not I wish an evil thing, this I practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>If but what not wish I, this I do, no longer I work out it, but the dwelling in me sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find therefore the law in the wishing to me to do the excellent, because with me the evil thing lies near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>I am pleased for wish the law of the God according to the inside man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>I see but another law in the members of me warring against the law of the mind of me, and making a captive me to the law of the sin to that existing in the members of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched I man; who me will rescue from the body of the death this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank the God by means of Jesus Anointed of the Lord of me. So then myself I with the indeed mind am in servitude to a law of God; with the but flesh, to a law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>No therefore now condemnation to those in an Anointed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>The for law of the spirit of the life by an Anointed Jesus freed me from the law of the sin and of the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>The for inability of the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, the God the of himself son having sent in a form of flesh of sin, and on account of sin, condemned the sin in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled by us, by those not according to flesh walking, but according to spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>Those for according to flesh being, the things of the flesh are minding; those but according to spirit, the things of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>The for mind of the flesh, death; the but mind of the spirit, life, and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind of the flesh, enmity to God; to the for law of the God not it is subject, neither for it is able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>those and in flesh being, to God to be pleasing not they are able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>You but not are in flesh, but in spirit, if indeed spirit of God dwells in you. If and any one spirit of an Anointed one not has, he not is of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>If but an Anointed in you, the indeed body dead with respect to sin; the but spirit life with respect to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>If but the spirit of him having raised up Jesus out of the dead ones dwells in you, he having raised the Anointed out of dead ones, will make alive also the mortal bodies of you, through the indwelling of him spirit in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, brethren, debtors we are not to the flesh, of the according to flesh to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>If for according to flesh you live, you are about to die; if but by spirit the practices of the body you put to death, you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>As many as for by spirit of God are led, these are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>Not for you received a spirit of bondage back to fear, but you received a spirit of sonship, by which we cry: Abba, the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>Itself the spirit testifies together with the spirit of us, that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>If and children, also heirs; heirs indeed of God, jointheirs and of an Anointed; if indeed we suffer with, so that also we may be glorified with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>I reckon for, that not comparable the sufferings of the now season with the being about glory to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>The for earnest desire of the creation the revelation of the sons of the God looks for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>To the for vanity the creation was placed under, (not voluntarily but through him having placed under,) in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that even itself the creation will be freed from the bondage of the corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>We know for, that all the creation groan together and travails together till the now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>not only and, but also ourselves the firstfruit of the spirit having, and we ourselves in ourselves groan, a sonship looking for, the redemption of the body of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>By the for hope we were saved. A hope but being seen, not is a hope; what for sees one, why also hopes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>If but what not we see, we hope, with patience we wait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>In like manner and also the spirit helps the weaknesses of us; the for what we should pray as it behooves, not we know, but itself the spirit intercedes on behalf of us with groans unspoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>He but searching the hearts, knows what the mind of the spirit, because according to God it intercedes on behalf of holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>We know and, that to those who love the God all things work together for good, to those according to a purpose called being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>Because whom he foreknew, also he before marked out copies of the likeness of the son of himself for the to be him a firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Whom and he before marked out, those also he called; and whom he called, those also he justified whom and he justified, those also he glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>When then shall we say to these things? If the God on behalf of us, who against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>Who indeed of the own son not spared, but on behalf of us all delivered up him; how not also with him the things all to us will he graciously give?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will bring a charge against chosen ones of God? God that justifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who he condemning? Anointed that having died, still more and also having been raised, who also is on right of the God, who and intercedes on behalf of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who us will separate from the love of the Anointed? Affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>(as it has been written: That on a account of thee we are put to death whole the day; we were accounted as sheep of slaughter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in these all we more than conquer through the one having loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>I am persuaded for, that neither death nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor things being present, nor things being about to come, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any creation other will be able us to separate from the love of the God, of that in Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>Was wishing for myself I an accursed thing to be from the Anointed one on behalf of the brethren of me, of the relatives of me according to flesh;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>So then not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of the pitying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>Says for the writing to the Pharaoh: That for same this I raised up thee, that I might show in thee the power of me, and that may be declared the name of me in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then whom he wills, he pities; whom and he wills, he hardens.</verse>
