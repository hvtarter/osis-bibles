The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>messengers and those not having kept the of themselves principality, but having left the own habitation, for a judgment of a great day, with chains perpetual under thick darkness have been kept;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the about them cities, the like to them manner having committed fornication, and having gone away after flesh of another, are placed before an example, of fire agelasting retributive justice are undergoing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>In like manner truly also these dream ones flesh indeed they pollute, lordships and they set aside, glories and they revile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>The but Michael the chief messenger, when with the accuser contending he reasoned about the of Moses; body, not he dared a judgment to bring against of reviling, but he said: May rebuke thee Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Woe, to them, because in the way of the Kain they went, and in the error of the Balaam reward they rushed, and in the contradiction of the Kore they destroyed themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are in the lovefeasts of you hidden rocks, feasting together without fear, themselves feeding; clouds without water, by winds being swept along; trees autumnal, unfruitful, twice having died, having been rooted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>waves wild of sea, foaming out the of themselves shame; stars wandering, for which the gloom of the darkness for an age has been kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>Prophesied and also these seventh from Adam Enoch, saying: Lo, came a Lord in holy myriads of himself,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are murmurers, complainers, according to the lusts of themselves walking; and the mouth of them speaks swelling words, admiring faces, of gain on account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>You but, beloved ones, do you remember the words of those having been before spoken by the apostles of the Lord of us Jesus Anointed;</verse>
