  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul <note>The Paul's point in writing this epistle, is to strengthen and encourage the Philippians by all means possible, not to faint, but more than that, to go forward. And first of all he commends their former deeds, to exhort them to go forward: which thing he says he fully hopes they will do, and that by the testimony of their abundant charity. But in the meantime he refers all things to the grace of God.</note> and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the <note>By the bishops are meant both the pastors who have the dispensation of the word, and the elders that govern: and by deacons are meant those that were stewards of the treasury of the Church, and had to look after the poor.</note> bishops and deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thanke my God, hauing you in perfect memorie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>(Alwayes in all my praiers for all you, praying with gladnesse)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>For your <note>Because you also are made partakers of the Gospel.</note> fellowship in the gospel from the <note>Ever since I knew you.</note> first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the <note>The Spirit of God will not forsake you to the very latter end, until your mortal bodies will appear before the judgment of Christ to be glorified.</note> day of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my <note>A true proof of a true knitting together with Christ.</note> bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my <note>He calls his bonds «grace», as though he had received some singular benefit.</note> grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>
          <note>He declares his good will towards them, in addition showing by what means they may chiefly be strengthened and encouraged, that is, by continual prayer.</note>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>
          <note>He shows what thing we ought to chiefly desire, that is, first of all that we may increase in the true knowledge of God (so that we may be able to discern things that differ from one another), and also in charity, that even to the end we may give ourselves to truly good works, to the glory of God by Jesus Christ.</note>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>That ye may alowe those things which are best, that ye may be pure, and without offence vntill the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Being filled with the <note>If righteousness is the tree, and good works the fruits, then the papists are truly deceived indeed, when they say that works are the cause of righteousness.</note> fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>
          <note>He prevents the offence that might come by his persecution, by which different ones took occasion to disgrace his apostleship. And to these he answers, that God has blessed his imprisonment in such a way, that he has by that means become more famous, and the dignity of the Gospel by this occasion is greatly enlarged, although not all men are happy with it, yet it has enlarged indeed.</note>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>So that my bonds <note>For Christ's sake.</note> in Christ are manifest in all the <note>In the emperor's court.</note> palace, and in all other [places];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the <note>The Gospel is called the word, to set forth the excellence of it.</note> word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some preache. Christ euen through enuie and strife, and some also of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The one preach Christ of contention, not <note>Not with a pure mind: for otherwise their doctrine was pure.</note> sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But the others of loue, knowing that I am set for the defence of the Gospell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>
          <note>He shows by setting forth his own example, that the end of our afflictions is true joy, and this results through the power of the Spirit of Christ, who he gives to those that ask.</note>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in <note>Under a false pretence and disguise: for they make Christ a cloak for their ambition and envy.</note> pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I knowe that this shall turne to my saluation through your prayer, and by the helpe of the Spirit of Iesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>
          <note>We must continue even to the end, with great confidence, having nothing before our eyes except for Christ's glory alone, whether we live or die.</note>According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For Christ is to me both in life, &amp; in death aduantage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>
          <note>An example of a true shepherd, who considers more how he may profit his sheep, than he considers any benefit of his own whatsoever.</note>But if I live in the <note>To live in this mortal body.</note> flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am distressed betweene both, desiring to be loosed and to be with Christ, which is best of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Neuerthelesse, to abide in the flesh, is more needefull for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And this am I sure of, that I shal abide, and with you all continue, for your furtherance and ioy of your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>That ye may more aboundantly reioyce in Iesvs Christ for me, by my comming to you againe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>
          <note>Having set down those things before in manner of a preface, he descends now to exhortations, warning them first of all to consent both in doctrine and mind, and afterward, that being thus knit together with those common bonds, they continue through the strength of faith to bear all adversity in such a way, that they allow nothing unworthy of the profession of the Gospel.</note>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye <note>The word signifies to stand fast in, and it is proper to wrestlers, that stand fast and do not move their feet back at all.</note> stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>
          <note>We ought not to be discouraged but rather encouraged by the persecutions which the enemies of the Gospel imagine and practise against us: seeing that the persecutions are certain witnesses from God himself both of our salvation, and of the destruction of the wicked.</note>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>
          <note>He proves his statement that persecution is a token of our salvation, because it is a gift of God to suffer for Christ, which gift he bestows upon his own, as he does the gift of faith.</note>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>
          <note>Now he shows for what purpose he made mention of his afflictions.</note>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If <note>A most earnest request to remove all those things, by which that great and special consent and agreement is commonly broken, that is, contention and pride, by which it comes to pass that they separate themselves from one another.</note> [there be] therefore any consolation in <note>Any Christian comfort.</note> Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any <note>If any seeking of inward love.</note> bowels and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the <note>Equal love.</note> same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>That nothing be done through contention or vaine glory, but that in meekenesse of minde euery man esteeme other better then himselfe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Looke not euery man on his owne things, but euery man also on the things of other men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>
          <note>He sets before them a most perfect example of all modesty and sweet conduct, Christ Jesus, whom we ought to follow with all our might: who abased himself so much for our sakes, although he is above all, that he took upon himself the form of a servant, that is, our flesh, willingly subject to all weaknesses, even to the death of the cross.</note>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Who, being in the <note>Such as God himself is, and therefore God, for there is no one in all parts equal to God but God himself.</note> form of God, <note>Christ, that glorious and everlasting God, knew that he might rightfully and lawfully not appear in the base flesh of man, but remain with majesty fit for God: yet he chose rather to debase himself.</note> thought it not robbery to be <note>If the Son is equal with the Father, then is there of necessity an equality, which Arrius that heretic denies: and if the Son is compared to the Father, then is there a distinction of persons, which Sabellius that heretic denies.</note> equal with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>But made himself of <note>He brought himself from all things, as it were to nothing.</note> no reputation, and took upon him the <note>By taking our manhood upon him.</note> form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>He humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Crosse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>
          <note>He shows the most glorious even of Christ's submission, to teach us that modesty is the true way to true praise and glory.</note>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a <note>Dignity and high distinction, and that which accompanies it.</note> name which is above every name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>That at the name of Jesus <note>All creatures will at length be subject to Christ.</note> every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>And [that] <note>Every nation.</note> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>
          <note>The conclusion: we must go on to salvation with humility and submission by the way of our vocation.</note>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, <note>He is said to make an end of his salvation who runs in the race of righteousness.</note> work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>
          <note>A most sure and grounded argument against pride, because we have nothing in us praiseworthy, but it comes from the free gift of God, and is outside of us, for we do not have ability or power, so much as to will well (much less to do well), except only by the free mercy of God.</note>For it is God which worketh in you both <note>The reason why we are not statues; and yet we do not will well by nature, but only because God has made of our wicked will a good will.</note> to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>
          <note>He describes modesty by the contrary effects of pride, teaching us that it is far both from all malicious and secret or inward hatred, and also from open contentions and brawlings.</note>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>
          <note>To be short, he requires a life without fault, and pure, so that being enlightened with the word of God, they may shine in the darkness of this world.</note>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>Holding forth the <note>The Gospel is called the word of life, because of the effects which it produces.</note> word of life; <note>Again he urges them forward, setting before them his true apostolic care that he had for them: in addition comforting them to the end that they should not be sorry for the greatness of his afflictions, no, not even if he should die to make perfect their sacrifice with his blood, as it were with a drink offering.</note> that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yea, and if I be offered upon the <note>As if he said, I brought you Philippians to Christ, and my desire is that you present yourselves a living sacrifice to him, and then it will not grieve me to be offered up as a drink offering, to accomplish this your spiritual offering.</note> sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause also be ye glad, and reioyce with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>
          <note>Moreover, he strengthens and encourages their minds both by sending back Epaphroditus to them, whose fidelity towards them, and great pains in helping him, he commends: and also promising to send Timothy shortly to them, by whose presence they will receive great benefit. And he hopes also himself to come shortly to them, if God wills.</note>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of <note>May be confirmed in the joy of my mind.</note> good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I haue no man like minded, who will faithfully care for your matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For <note>The most part.</note> all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But yee knowe the proofe of him, that as a sonne with the father, hee hath serued with me in the Gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him therefore I hope to send assoone as I knowe howe it will goe with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And trust in the Lorde, that I also my selfe shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But I supposed it necessarie to sende my brother Epaphroditus vnto you, my companion in labour, and fellowe souldier, euen your messenger, and he that ministred vnto me such things as I wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he longed after all you, and was full of heauinesse, because yee had heard that hee had beene sicke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>And no doubt he was sicke, very neere vnto death: but God had mercie on him, and not on him onely, but on me also, least I should haue sorowe vpon sorowe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I sent him therefore the more diligently, that when yee shoulde see him againe, yee might reioyce, and I might be the lesse sorowfull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receiue him therefore in the Lord with all gladnesse, and make much of such:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>Because for the <note>He calls here the work of Christ the visiting of Christ, being poor and in bonds in the person of Paul.</note> work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, <note>A conclusion of those things which have been said before, that is, that they go forward cheerfully in the Lord.</note> my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. <note>A preface to the next admonition that follows, to take good heed and beware of false apostles, who join circumcision with Christ, (that is to say, justification by works, with free justification by faith), and beat into men's head the ceremonies which are abolished, instead of true exercises of godliness and charity. And he calls them dogs, as profane barkers, and evil workmen, because they neglected true works and did not teach the true use of them. To be short, he calls them concision, because in urging circumcision, they cut off themselves and others from the Church.</note> To write the <note>Which you have often times heard from me.</note> same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the <note>He alludes to circumcision; and while they were boasting in it, they broke apart the Church.</note> concision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>
          <note>He shows that we ought to use true circumcision, that is, the circumcision of the heart, so that by cutting off all wicked affections by the power of Christ, we may serve God in purity of life.</note>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence <note>In outward things which do not at all pertain to the soul.</note> in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>
          <note>He does not doubt to prefer himself even according to the flesh, before those perverse zealous urgers of the Law, that all men may know that he does with good judgment of mind, consider of little worth all of those outward things. For he who has Christ lacks nothing, and confidence in our works cannot stand with the free justification in Christ by faith.</note>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised the eight day, of the kinred of Israel, of the tribe of Beniamin, an Ebrewe of the Ebrewes, by the Lawe a Pharise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>Concerning zeale, I persecuted ye Church: touching the righteousnesse which is in the Law, I was vnrebukeable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things were <note>Which I considered as gain.</note> gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yea doubtless, and I count <note>He shuts out all works, those that go before, as well as those that come after faith.</note> all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may <note>That in their place I might get Christ, and from a poor man become rich, so far am I from losing anything at all.</note> win Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>And be found in <note>In Christ: for those that are found outside of Christ are subject to condemnation.</note> him, <note>That is, to be in Christ, to be found not in a man's own righteousness, but clothed with the righteousness of Christ imputed to him.</note> not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>
          <note>This is the end of righteousness by faith with regard to us, that by the power of his resurrection we may escape from death.</note>That I may <note>That I may indeed feel him, and have an experience of him.</note> know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the <note>The way to that eternal salvation is to follow Christ's steps by afflictions and persecutions, until we come to Christ himself, who is our mark at which we aim, and receive that reward to which God calls us in him. And the apostle sets these true exercises of godliness against those vain ceremonies of the Law, in which the false apostles put the sum of godliness.</note> fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>If by any means I might attain unto the <note>To everlasting life, which follows the resurrection of the saints.</note> resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am <note>For we run only as far forth as we are laid hold on by Christ, that is, as God gives us strength, and shows us the way.</note> apprehended of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I count not my selfe, that I haue attained to it, but one thing I doe: I forget that which is behinde, and endeuour my selfe vnto that which is before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>And followe hard toward the marke, for the prise of the hie calling of God in Christ Iesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>
          <note>The conclusion of this exhortation standing upon three members: the first is, that those who have profited in the truth of this doctrine should continue in it. The second is, that if there are any who are yet ignorant and do not understand these things, and who doubt of the abolishing of the Law, they should cause no trouble, and should be gently waited for, until they also are instructed by the Lord. The third is, that they judge the false apostles by their fruits: in which he does not doubt to set forth himself as an example.</note>Let us therefore, as many as be <note>He said before that he was not perfect. So that in this place he calls those perfect who have somewhat profited in the knowledge of Christ and the Gospel, whom he sets against the rude and ignorant, as he himself expounds in (Phi_3:16).</note> perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Neuerthelesse, in that whereunto wee are come, let vs proceede by one rule, that wee may minde one thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brethren, bee followers of mee, and looke on them, which walke so, as yee haue vs for an ensample.</verse>

          <note>He shows what the false apostles truly are, not from malice or ambition, but with sorrow and tears, that is, because being enemies of the Gospel (for that is joined with persecuting it) they regard nothing else, but the benefits of this life: that is to say, that abounding in peace, and quietness, and all worldly pleasures, they may live in great estimation among men, whose miserable end he forewarned them of.</note>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Whose <note>Reward.</note> end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] <note>Which they hunt after from men's hands.</note> glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>
          <note>He sets against these fellows true pastors who neglect earthly things, and aspire to heaven only, where they know that even in their bodies they will be clothed with that eternal glory, by the power of God.</note>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who shall change our vile bodie, that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious body, according to the working, whereby hee is able euen to subdue all things vnto him selfe.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, <note>A rehearsal of the conclusion: that they bravely continue until they have gotten the victory, trusting in the Lord's strength.</note> my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and <note>My honour.</note> crown, so stand fast in the <note>In that unification of which the Lord is the bond.</note> Lord, [my] dearly beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>
          <note>He also calls on some by name, partly because they needed private exhortation, and partly also to stir up others to be more prompt and ready.</note>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the <note>God is said, after the manner of men, to have a book, in which the names of his elect are written, to whom he will give everlasting life. Ezekiel calls it the writing of the house of Israel, and the secret of the Lord; (Eze_13:9).</note> book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>
          <note>He adds particular exhortations: and the first is, that the joy of the Philippians should not be hindered by any afflictions that the wicked imagine and work against them.</note>Rejoice in the <note>So is the joy of the world distinguished from our joy.</note> Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>
          <note>The second is, that taking all things in good part, they behave themselves moderately with all men.</note>Let your <note>Your quiet and settled mind.</note> moderation be known unto all men. <note>The taking away of an objection: we must not be anxious because of impatience, seeing that God is at hand to give us help in time for all our miseries.</note> The Lord [is] at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>
          <note>The third is, that we are not too anxious for anything, but with sure confidence give God thanks, and desire from him whatever we have need of, that with a quiet conscience we may wholly and with all our hearts submit ourselves to him.</note>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with <note>So David began very often with tears, but ended with thanksgiving.</note> thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the <note>That great quietness of mind, which God alone gives in Christ.</note> peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your <note>He divides the mind into the heart, that is, into that part which is the seat of the will and affections, and into the higher part, by which we understand and reason about matters.</note> hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>
          <note>A general conclusion, that as they have been taught both in word and example, so they build their lives to the rule of all holiness and righteousness.</note>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <note>Whatever things are such that they beautify and set you apart with a holy gravity.</note> [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Which yee haue both learned &amp; receiued, and heard, and seene in mee: those things doe, and the God of peace shalbe with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>
          <note>He witnesses that their liberality was acceptable to him, with which they helped him in his extreme poverty: but yet so moderating his words, that he might declare himself void of all suspicion of dishonesty, and that he has a mind content both with prosperity and adversity, and to be short, that he rests himself only in the will of God.</note>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in respect of <note>As though I am speaking concerning my want.</note> want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be <note>He uses a general word, and yet he speaks but of one type of cross, which is poverty, for poverty commonly brings all types of discomforts with it.</note> abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am <note>This is a metaphor taken from holy things or sacrifices, for our life is like a sacrifice.</note> instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I am able to do al things through the helpe of Christ, which strengtheneth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Notwithstanding yee haue well done, that yee did communicate to mine affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>
          <note>He witnesses that he remembers also their former benefits, and again puts away sinister suspicion of greedy desire, in that that he received nothing from anyone else.</note>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the <note>At the beginning, when I preached the Gospel among you.</note> beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For euen when I was in Thessalonica, yee sent once, and afterward againe for my necessitie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>
          <note>He witnesses again that he admits well of their benefit, not so much for his own sake as for theirs, because they gave it not so much to him, as they offered it to God as a sacrifice, of which the Lord himself will not be forgetful.</note>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an <note>He alludes to the sweet smelling savours that were offered under the old Law.</note> odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God shall fulfill all your necessities through his riches with glorie in Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Vnto God euen our Father be praise for euermore, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute all the Saintes in Christ Iesus. The brethren, which are with me, greete you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of <note>Those who belong to the emperor Nero.</note> Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all, Amen. Written to the Philippians from Rome, and sent by Epaphroditus.</verse>
