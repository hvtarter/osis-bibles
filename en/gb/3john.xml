        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou doest <note>As becomes a believer and a Christian.</note> faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou <note>He commends to Gaius, either those same men whom he had entertained before returning to him, about the affairs of the Church, or else some other who had similar business.</note> bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</verse>
