      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now after the <note>The beginning of this book depends on the last chapter of Deuteronomy which was written by Joshua as a preparation to his history.</note> death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, <note>The Argument - In this book the Holy Spirit sets most lively before us the accomplishment of God's promise, who as he promised by the mouth of Moses, that a prophet would be raised up to the people like him, whom he wills to obey, (Deu_18:15): so he shows himself true to his promise, as at all other times, and after the death of Moses his faithful servant, he raises up Joshua to be ruler and governor over his people, that they should neither be discouraged for lack of a captain, nor have reason to distrust God's promises later. So that Joshua might be confirmed in his calling, and the people also might have no opportunity to grudge, as though he were not approved by God: he is adorned with most excellent gifts and graces from God, both to govern the people with counsel, and to defend them with strength, that he lacks nothing which either belongs to a valiant captain, or a faithful minister. So he overcomes all difficulties, and brings them into the land of Canaan: which according to God's ordinance he divides among the people and appoints their borders: he established laws and ordinances, and put them in remembrance of God's revealed benefits, assuring them of his grace and favour if they obey God, and of his plagues and vengeance if they disobey him. This history represents Jesus Christ the true Joshua, who leads us into eternal happiness, signified to us by this land of Canaan. From the beginning of Genesis to the end of this book is 2567 years. For from Adam to the flood are 1656, from the flood to the departure of Abraham out of Chaldea 423, and from then to the death of Joseph 290. So that Genesis contains 2369, Exodus 140, the other three books of Moses 40, Joshua 27. So the whole makes 2576 years.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my seruant is dead: nowe therefore arise, go ouer this Iorden, thou, and all this people, vnto the lande which I giue them, that is, to ye children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Euery place that the sole of your foote shall treade vpon, haue I giuen you, as I said vnto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the <note>Of Zin, called Kadesh and Paran.</note> wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the <note>Meaning, the whole land of Canaan.</note> Hittites, and unto the great <note>Called Mediterranean.</note> sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There shall not a man be able to withstande thee all the dayes of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leaue thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of a good courage: for vnto this people shalt thou deuide the lande for an inheritance, which I sware vnto their fathers to giue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it [to] the right hand or [to] the left, that thou mayest <note>He shows where true prosperity consists, even to obey the word of God.</note> prosper whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and <note>Showing that it is not possible to govern well, without the continual study of God's word.</note> night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Haue not I commanded thee, saying, Be strong and of a good courage, feare not, nor be discouraged? for I the Lord thy God will be with thee, whithersoeuer thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Ioshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for <note>Meaning, from the day that this was proclaimed, (Jos_3:2).</note> within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And vnto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh spake Ioshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this <note>Which belonged to Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan.</note> land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wiues, your children, and your cattell shall remaine in the land which Moses gaue you on this side Iorden: but ye shall goe ouer before your brethren armed, all that be men of warre, and shall helpe them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as [he hath given] you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant <note>By your request, but yet by God's secret appointment, (Deu_33:21).</note> gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>Then they answered Ioshua, saying, Al that thou hast commaunded vs, we will doe, and whithersoeuer thou sendest vs, we will goe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, <note>They not only promise to obey him as long as God is with him: but to help punish all who rebel against him.</note> so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whosoeuer shall rebell against thy commaundement, and will not obey thy wordes in all that thou commaundest him, let him bee put to death: onely be strong and of good courage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of <note>Which was in the plain of Moab near Jordan.</note> Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>Then report was made to the King of Iericho, saying, Beholde, there came men hither to night, of the children of Israel, to spie out the countrey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, <note>Though the wicked see the hand of God on them, they do not repent, but seek how they may by their power and policy resist his working.</note> Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>(But ye woman had taken the two men, and hid them) Therefore saide she thus, There came men vnto me, but I wist not whence they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And when they shut the gate in the darke, the men went out, whither the men went I wote not: followe ye after them quickly, for ye shall ouertake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the <note>Meaning, on the house: for then their houses were flat above, so that they might do their business on it.</note> roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And certaine men pursued after them, the way to Iorden, vnto the foordes, and as soone as they which pursued after them, were gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they were a sleepe, she came vp vnto them vpon the roofe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your <note>For so God promised, (Deu_28:7; Jos_5:1).</note> terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we haue heard, howe the Lord dried vp the water of the redde Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt, and what you did vnto the two Kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Iorden, vnto Sihon and to Og, whom ye vtterly destroyed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard [these things], our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for <note>In this the great mercy of God appears, that in this common destruction he would draw a most miserable sinner to repent, and confess his Name.</note> the LORD your God, he [is] God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, sweare vnto me by the Lord; that as I haue shewed you mercie, ye will also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, and giue me a true token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>And that yee will saue aliue my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue: and that yee will deliuer our soules from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men answered her, <note>We warrant you on pain of our lives.</note> Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them downe by a corde thorowe the windowe: for her house was vpon the towne wall, and she dwelt vpon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said unto them, Get you to the <note>which was near to the city.</note> mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said unto her, <note>We will be released from our oath if you perform this condition that follows for so shall you and yours be delivered.</note> We [will be] blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this cord of red threde in the window, whereby thou lettest vs downe, and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, &amp; all thy fathers houshold home to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, [that] whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, <note>He shall be guilty of his own death.</note> his blood [shall be] upon his head, and we [will be] guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood [shall be] on our head, if [any] hand be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>And if thou utter this our <note>So that others should think to escape by the same means.</note> business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she answered, According vnto your wordes, so be it: then she sent them away, &amp; they departed, &amp; she bound the red cord in ye window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they departed, and came into the mountaine, and there abode three dayes, vntil the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but founde them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer, and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and tolde him all things that came vnto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>Also they saide vnto Ioshua, Surely the Lorde hath deliuered into our handes all the lande: for euen all the inhabitants of the countrey faint because of vs.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to <note>Which according to the Hebrews was in March, about 40 days after Moses' death.</note> Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after <note>Which was given to prepare food (Jos_1:11).</note> three days, that the officers went through the host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>And commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Arke of the couenat of the Lord your God, and the Priestes of the Leuites bearing it, ye shall depart from your place, and goe after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it, about two thousande cubites by measure: ye shall not come neere vnto it, that ye may knowe the way, by the which ye shall goe: for ye haue not gone this way in times past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>(Nowe Ioshua had saide vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues: for to morowe the Lord will doe wonders among you)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>Also Ioshua spake vnto the Priestes, saying, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and goe ouer before the people: so they tooke vp the Arke of the couenant, &amp; went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>Then the Lorde saide vnto Ioshua, This day will I begin to magnifie thee in the sight of all Israel, which shall knowe, that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still <note>Even in the channel where the stream had run, (Jos_3:17)</note> in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>Then Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Come hither, and heare the wordes of the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, <note>By this miracle in dividing the water.</note> Hereby ye shall know that the living God [is] among you, and [that] he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Beholde, the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde of all the worlde passeth before you into Iorden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take you <note>Who would set up twelve stones in remembrance of the benefit.</note> twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes (that beare the Arke of the Lorde God the Lorde of all the worlde) shall stay in the waters of Iorden, the waters of Iorden shall be cut off: for the waters that come from aboue, shall stande still vpon an heape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>Then when the people were departed from their tentes to goe ouer Iorden, the Priestes bearing the Arke of the Couenant, went before people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his <note>Because the river was accustomed at this time to be full, the miracle is so much greater.</note> banks all the time of harvest,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>Then the waters that came downe from aboue, stayed and rose vpon an heape and departed farre from the citie of Adam, that was beside Zaretan: but the waters that came downe towarde the Sea of the wildernes, euen the salt Sea, failed, and were cut off: so the people went right ouer against Iericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood <note>Either tarrying till the people were past, or as some read, sure, as though they had been on dry land.</note> firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And when all the people were wholy gone ouer Iorden, (after the Lord had spoken vnto Ioshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take you twelue me out of the people, out of euery tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood <note>As in (Jos_3:17).</note> firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the <note>Meaning, the place where they would camp.</note> lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Ioshua called the twelue men, whome he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of euery tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Ioshua said vnto them, Go ouer before the Arke of the Lorde your God, euen through the middes of Iorden, and take vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shoulder acccording vnto the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>That this may be a sign among you, [that] when your <note>God commands that not only we ourselves profit by this wonderful work, but that our posterity may know the cause of it, and glorify his Name.</note> children ask [their fathers] in time to come, saying, What [mean] ye by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then ye may answere them, That the waters of Iorden were cut off before the Arke of the couenant of the Lord: for when it passed through Iorden, the waters of Iorden were cut off: therefore these stones are a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>Then ye children of Israel did euen so as Ioshua had commanded, &amp; tooke vp twelue stones out of the mids of Iorden as ye Lord had said vnto Ioshua, according to the nomber of the tribes of the children of Israel, &amp; caried them away with them vnto the lodging, &amp; layd them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up <note>Besides the twelve stones that were carried by the tribes and set up in Gilgal.</note> twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>So the Priests, which bare ye Arke, stoode in the middes of Iorden, vntill euery thing was finished that ye Lorde had comanded Ioshua to say vnto the people, according to all that Moses charged Ioshua: then the people hasted &amp; went ouer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, <note>Meaning, in the presence or sight of the people.</note> in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the sonnes of Reuben, &amp; the sonnes of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh went ouer before the children of Israel armed, as Moses had charged them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the <note>That is, before the Ark.</note> LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>That day the Lord magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses all dayes of his life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the <note>The Amorites were on both sides of Jordan, of which two kings were slain already on the side toward Moab.</note> Amorites, which [were] on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which [were] by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, <note>For now they had left it off, about 40 years.</note> and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>They gathered themselues together, to fight against Ioshua, &amp; against Israel with one accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.3'>But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho, and to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.4'>They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and <note>Because they were all worn.</note> bound up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.5'>And olde shoes and clouted vpon their feete: also the raiment vpon them was old, and all their prouision of bread was dried, and mouled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.6'>So they came vnto Ioshua into the hoste to Gilgal, and said vnto him, and vnto the men of Israel, Wee be come from a farre countrey: nowe therefore make a league with vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.7'>And the men of Israel said unto the <note>For the Gibeonites and the Hivites were all one people.</note> Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.8'>And they said vnto Ioshua, We are thy seruants. Then Ioshua saide vnto them, Who are ye? And whence come ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.9'>And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of <note>Even the idolaters for fear of death will pretend to honour the true God, and receive his religion.</note> the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.10'>And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyonde Iorden, to Sihon King of Heshbon, &amp; to Og King of Bashan, which were at Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.11'>Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our countrey spake to vs, saying, Take vitailes with you for the iourney, and go to meete them, and say vnto them, Wee are your seruants: now therefore make ye a league with vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.12'>This our <note>The wicked lack no art, nor spare no lies to set forth their policy, when they will deceive the servants of God.</note> bread we took hot [for] our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.13'>Also these bottels of wine which we filled, were newe, and lo, they be rent, and these our garments and our shooes are olde, by reason of the exceeding great iourney.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.14'>And the <note>Some think that the Israelites are of their victuals, and so made a league with them.</note> men took of their victuals, and asked not [counsel] at the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.15'>So Ioshua made peace with them, &amp; made a league with them, that he would suffer them to liue: also the Princes of the Congregation sware vnto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.16'>But at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.17'>And the children of Israel <note>From Gilgal.</note> journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities [were] Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.18'>And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation <note>Fearing lest for their sin the plague of God would have come on them all.</note> murmured against the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.19'>Then all the Princes said vnto all the Congregation, We haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel: nowe therefore we may not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.20'>This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the <note>This does not establish rash oaths, but shows God's mercy toward his, who would not punish them for their sin.</note> oath which we sware unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.21'>And the Princes sayd vnto them againe, Let them liue, but they shall hewe wood, and drawe water vnto all the Congregation, as the Princes appoint them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.22'>Ioshua then called them, and talked with them, and sayd, Wherefore haue ye beguiled vs, saying, We are very farre from you, when ye dwel among vs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.23'>Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for <note>For the use of the tabernacle and the temple when it will be built.</note> the house of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.24'>And they answered Ioshua, and sayd, Because it was tolde thy seruants, that the Lord thy God had commanded his seruant Moses to giue you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land out of your sight, therefore we were exceeding sore afraid for our liues at the presence of you, and haue done this thing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.25'>And beholde nowe, we are in thine hand: doe as it seemeth good and right in thine eyes to doe vnto vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.26'>And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the <note>Who were minded to put them to death for fear of God's wrath.</note> hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.27'>And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the <note>That is, for the service of the temple, as in (Jos_9:23).</note> altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.10'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>Now when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai and had destroyed it, ( for as he had done to Iericho and to the King thereof, so he had done to Ai and to the King thereof) and howe the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>Then they feared exceedingly: for Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the royall cities: for it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof were mightie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>Wherefore <note>That is, «Lord of justice», so tyrants take for themselves glorious names, when indeed they are the very enemies of God and all justice.</note> Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for they haue made peace with Ioshua and with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made <note>So envious the wicked are, when any depart from their hand.</note> war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua, euen to the hoste to Gilgal, saying, Withdrawe not thine hand from thy seruants: come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs, &amp; helpe vs: for all the Kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountaines, are gathered together against vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the men of might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.8'>And the LORD said unto Joshua, <note>Lest Joshua should have thought that God had sent this great power against him for his unlawful league with the Gibeonites, the Lord here strengthens him.</note> Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.9'>Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly: for he went vp from Gilgal all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, [and] were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: [they were] more which died with <note>So we see that all things serve to execute God's vengeance against the wicked.</note> hailstones than [they] whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then spake Ioshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord gaue the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he sayd in the sight of Israel, Sunne, stay thou in Gibeon, and thou moone, in the valley of Aialon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.13'>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of <note>Some read, the book of the righteous, meaning Moses: the Chaldea text reads, in the book of the Law, but it is likely that it was a book thus named, which is now lost.</note> Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.14'>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD <note>By taking away the enemies hearts and destroying them with the hail stones.</note> fought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.15'>After, Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him vnto the campe to Gilgal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.16'>But the fiue Kings fled and were hid in a caue at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.17'>And it was tolde Ioshua, saying, The fiue Kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.18'>Then Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it for to keepe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.19'>But stand ye not still: followe after your enemies, and smite all the hindmost, suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lorde your God hath giuen them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.20'>And when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an ende of slaying them with an exceeding great slaughter till they were consumed, and the rest that remained of them were entred into walled cities,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.21'>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in <note>Or in safety, so that none gave them as much as an evil word.</note> peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.22'>After, Ioshua sayd, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out these fiue Kings vnto me forth of the caue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.23'>And they did so, &amp; brought out those fiue Kings vnto him forth of the caue, euen the King of Ierusalem, the King of Hebron, ye King of Iarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.24'>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the <note>Signifying what would become of the rest of God's enemies, seeing that kings themselves were not spared.</note> necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.25'>And Ioshua sayd vnto them, Feare not, nor be faint hearted, but be strong and of a good courage: for thus will the Lord doe to all your enemies, against whome ye fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.26'>So then Ioshua smote them, and slewe them, and hanged them on fiue trees, and they hanged still vpon the trees vntill the euening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.27'>And at the going downe of the sunne, Ioshua gaue commaundement, that they should take them downe off the trees, and cast them into the caue (wherein they had bene hid) and they layde great stones vpon the caues mouth, which remaine vntill this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.28'>And that same day Ioshua tooke Makkedah &amp; smote it with the edge of the sword, and the King thereof destroyed he with them, and all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: for hee did to the King of Makkedah as he had done vnto the King of Iericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.29'>Then Ioshua went from Makkedah, and all Israel with him vnto Libnah, and fought against Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.30'>And the Lorde gaue it also and the King thereof into the hand of Israel: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein: he let none remaine in it: for he did vnto the King thereof, as he had done vnto the King of Iericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.31'>And Ioshua departed from Libnah, and all Israel with him vnto Lachish, and besieged it, and assaulted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.32'>And the Lord gaue Lachish into the hand of Israel, which tooke it the second day, &amp; smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein, according to all as he had done to Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.33'>Then Horam King of Gezer came vp to helpe Lachish: but Ioshua smote him and his people, vntill none of his remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.34'>And from Lachish Ioshua departed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, &amp; they besieged it, and assaulted it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.35'>And they tooke it the same day, &amp; smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed the same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.36'>Then Ioshua went vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him vnto Hebron, and they fought against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.37'>And when they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the sword, &amp; the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the soules that were therein: he left none remaining, according to all as he had done to Eglon: for he destroyed it vtterly, and all the soules that were therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.38'>So Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.40'>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the <note>Some read, Ashedoth, which signifies the descents of the hills.</note> vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.41'>And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea euen vnto Azzah, and all the countrey of Goshen, euen vnto Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.42'>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at <note>In one battle.</note> one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</verse>
