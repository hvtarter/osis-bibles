  <div type='book' osisID='Deut'>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These [be] the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on <note>In the country of Moab.</note> this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain <note>So that the wilderness was between the sea and the plain of Moab.</note> over against the Red [sea], between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <note>The Argument - The wonderful love of God toward his Church is actively set forth in this book. Even through their ingratitude and many rebellions against God, for the space forty years. (Deu_9:7) they deserved to have been cut off from the number of his people, and forever to have been deprived of the use of his holy word and ordinances: yet he ever preserved his Church even for his own mercy's sake, and would still have his name called upon among them. Wherefore he brings them into the land of Canaan, destroys their enemies, gives them their country, towns and goods, and exhorts them by the example of their fathers (whose infidelity, idolatry, adulteries, complaining and rebellions, he had most severely punished) to fear and obey the Lord, to embrace and keep his law without adding to it or diminishing from it. For by his word he would be known to be their God, and they his people, by his word he would govern his Church, and by the same they would learn to obey him: by his word he would discern the false prophet from the true, light form darkness, ignorance from knowledge, and his own people from all the other nations and infidels: teaching them by it to refuse and detest, destroy and abolish whatever is not agreeable to his holy will, seem it otherwise never so good or precious in the eyes of man. For this cause God promised to raise up kings and governors, for the setting forth of his word and preservation of his Church: giving to them a special charge for the executing of it: whom therefore he wills to exercise themselves diligently in the continual study and meditation of the same: that they might learn to fear the Lord, love their subjects, abhor covetousness and vices, and whatever offends the majesty of God. As he had before instructed their fathers in all things belonging both to his spiritual service and also for the maintenance of that society which is between men: so he prescribes here anew all such laws and ordinances, which either concern his divine service, or else are necessary for a common good: appointing to every estate and degree their charge and duty: as well, how to rule and live in the fear of God, as to nourish friendship toward their neighbours, and to preserve the order which God has established among men: threatening most horrible plagues to them that transgress his commandments, and promising blessings and happiness to those who observe and obey them.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>([There are] eleven days' [journey] from <note>In Horeb, or Sinai, forty years before the law was given: but because all that were then of age and judgment were now dead, Moses repeats the same to the youth who either then were not born, or had not judgment.</note> Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to passe in the first day of the eleuenth moneth, in the fourtieth yeere that Moses spake vnto the children of Israel according vnto all that the Lord had giuen him in commandement vnto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>After he had slain <note>By these examples of God's favour, their minds are prepared to receive the law.</note> Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, <note>The second time.</note> began Moses to declare this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>The LORD our God spake unto us in <note>In the second year and second month, (Num_10:11).</note> Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turne you and depart, and goe vnto the mountaine of the Amorites, and vnto all places neere thereunto in the plaine, in the mountaine, or in the valley: both Southwarde, and to the Sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and vnto Lebanon: euen vnto the great riuer, the riuer Perath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Beholde, I haue set the land before you: go in and possesse that land which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob, to giue vnto them and to their seede after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And I spake <note>By the counsel of Jethro my father-in-law, (Exo_18:19).</note> unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>The LORD your God hath <note>Not so much by the course of nature, as miraculously.</note> multiplied you, and, behold, ye [are] this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>(The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many moe as ye are, and blesse you, as he hath promised you)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I myself alone <note>Signifying how great a burden it is, to govern the people.</note> bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Take you wise men, and understanding, and <note>Whose godliness and uprightness is known.</note> known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>Then ye answered me and said, The thing is good that thou hast commanded vs to doe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the chief of your tribes, <note>Declaring what sort of men ought to have a public charge, read (Exo_18:21).</note> wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your iudges that same time, saying, Heare the controuersies betweene your brethren, and iudge righteously betwene euery man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; [but] ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment [is] <note>You are his Lieutenants.</note> God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring [it] unto me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>Also I commaunded you the same time all the things which ye should doe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>Then we departed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wildernesse (as yee haue seene) by the way of the mountaine of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commaunded vs: and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And <note>So that the fault was in themselves, that they did not sooner possess the inheritance promised.</note> I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Beholde, the Lord thy God hath layde the land before thee: go vp and possesse it, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath saide vnto thee: feare not, neither be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>
          <note>Read (Num_13:3).</note>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>So the saying pleased me well, and I tooke twelue men of you, of euery tribe one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>Who departed, and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the riuer Eshcol, and searched out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought [it] down unto us, and brought us word again, and <note>That is, Caleb, and Joshua; Moses prefers the better part to the greater, that is, two to ten.</note> said, [It is] a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Notwithstanding, ye would not go vp, but were disobedient vnto the commaundement of the Lord your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD <note>Such was the Jews unthankfulness, that they counted God's special love, hatred.</note> hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Whither shall we go up? our <note>The other ten, not Caleb and Joshua.</note> brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people [is] greater and taller than we; the cities [are] great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>But I sayd vnto you, Dread not, nor be afrayd of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God <note>Declaring that to renounce our own force, and constantly to follow our calling, and depend on the Lord, is true boldness, and agreeable to God.</note> which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>And in the wildernesse, where thou hast seene how the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doeth beare his sonne, in all the way which ye haue gone, vntill ye came vnto this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet for all this ye did not beleeue the Lord your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tentes in, in fire by night, that ye might see what way to goe, and in a cloude by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>Then the Lorde heard the voyce of your wordes, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely there shall not one of these men of this froward generation, see that good land, which I sware to giue vnto your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh: he shall see it, and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon, and to his children, because he hath constantly followed the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Also the Lorde was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not goe in thither,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>[But] Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth <note>Who minister to you.</note> before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your <note>Who were under twenty years of age, (Num_14:31).</note> little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turne backe, and take your iourney into the wildernesse by the way of the red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, <note>This declares man's nature, who will do that which God forbids, and will not do that which he commands.</note> we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I [am] <note>Signifying that man has no strength, but when God is at hand to help him.</note> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>And when I told you, ye would not heare, but rebelled against the commaundement of the Lord, and were presumptuous, and went vp into the mountaine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>Then the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine came out against you, and chased you (as bees vse to doe) and destroied you in Seir, euen vnto Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not <note>Because you rather showed your hypocrisy, than true repentance; rather lamenting the loss of your brethren, than repenting for your sins.</note> hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So ye abode in Kadesh a long time, according to the time that ye had remained before.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then <note>They obeyed, after God had chastised them.</note> we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir <note>Eight and thirty years, as in (Deu_2:14).</note> many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And the Lord spake vnto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Ye haue compassed this mountaine long ynough: turne you Northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command thou the people, saying, Ye [are] to pass through the <note>This was the second time, before they had caused the Israelites to return, (Num_20:21).</note> coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>Ye shall not prouoke them: for I wil not giue you of their land so much as a foot breadth, because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Ye shall buy meate of them for money to eate, and ye shall also procure water of them for money to drinke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD thy God hath <note>And given you means, with which you may make recompence: also God will direct you by his providence, as he has done.</note> blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>And when we were departed from our brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plaine, from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and went by the way of the wildernes of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children <note>Which were the Moabites and Ammonites.</note> of Lot [for] a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>The <note>Signifying that as these giants were driven out for their sins: so the wicked when their sins are ripe, cannot avoid God's plagues.</note> Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>They also were taken for gyants as the Anakims: whom the Moabites call Emims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time, whome the children of Esau chased out and destroyed them before them, and dwelt in their steade: as Israel shall doe vnto the land of his possession, which the Lord hath giuen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now rise vp, sayd I, and get you ouer the riuer Zered: and we went ouer the riuer Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the <note>He shows by this, that as God is true in his promise, so his threatenings are not in vain.</note> space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, [was] thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the <note>His plague and punishment to destroy all that were twenty years old and above.</note> hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>Then the Lord spake vnto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou shalt goe through Ar the coast of Moab this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>And thou shalt come neere ouer against the children of Ammon: but shalt not lay siege vnto them, nor moue warre against them: for I will not giue thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession: for I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot for a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also was accounted a land <note>Who called themselves Rephaims: that is, preservers, or physicians to heal and reform vices: but were indeed Zamzummims, that is, wicked and abominable.</note> of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>A people that was great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the Lord destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them in their inheritance, and dwelt in their stead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>As he did to the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims before them, and they possessed them, and dwelt in their stead vnto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim euen vnto Azzah, the Caphtorims which came out of Caphtor destroyed them, and dwelt in their steade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the <note>According to his promise made to Abraham, (Gen_15:16).</note> Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess [it], and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day will I <note>This declares that the hearts of men are in God's hands either to be made faint, or bold.</note> begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations [that are] under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>Then I sent messengers out of the wildernes of Kedemoth vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, with wordes of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>Let me passe through thy land: I will go by the hie way: I will neither turne vnto the right hand nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Thou shalt sell me meate for money, for to eate, and shalt giue me water for money for to drinke: onely I will go through on my foote,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God <note>God in his election and reprobation not only appoints the ends, but the means tending to the same.</note> hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as [appeareth] this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the Lorde sayd vnto me, Beholde, I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possesse and inherite his land.</verse>
