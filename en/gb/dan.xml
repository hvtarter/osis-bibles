      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the <note>Read (2Ki_24:1; Jer_25:1).</note> third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. <note>The Argument - The great providence of God, and his singular mercy towards his Church are set forth here most vividly, who never leaves his own destitute, but now in their greatest miseries and afflictions gives them Prophets, such as Ezekiel and Daniel, whom he adorned with special graces of his Holy Spirit. And Daniel above all others had most special revelations of such things as would come to the Church, even from the time that they were in captivity, to the last end of the world, and to the general resurrection, as of the four Monarchies and empires of all the world, that is, of the Babylonians, Persians, Grecians, and Romans. Also of the certain number of the times even until Christ, when all ceremonies and sacrifices would cease, because he would be the accomplishment of them: moreover he shows Christ's office and the reason of his death, which was by his sacrifice to take away sins, and to bring everlasting life. And as from the beginning God always exercised his people under the cross, so he teaches here, that after Christ is offered, he will still leave this exercise to his Church, until the dead rise again, and Christ gathers his own into his kingdom in the heavens.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of <note>Which was a plain by Babylon, where the temple of their great god was, and is here taken for Babylon.</note> Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spake unto <note>Who was as master of the guards.</note> Ashpenaz the master of his <note>He calls them «eunuchs» whom the King nourished and brought up to be rulers of other countries afterwards.</note> eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of the <note>His purpose was to keep them as hostages, and so that he might show himself victorious, and also by their good entreaty and learning of his religion, they might favour him rather than the Jews, and so to be able to serve him as governors in their land. Moreover by this means the Jews might be better kept in subjection, fearing otherwise to bring hurt upon these noble men.</note> king's seed, and of the princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well <note>The King required three things: that they should be of noble birth, that they should be intelligent and learned, and that they should be of a strong and handsome nature, so that they might do him better service. This he did for his own benefit, therefore it is not to praise his liberality: yet in this he is worthy of praise, that he esteemed learning, and knew that it was a necessary means to govern by.</note> favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the <note>That they might forget their own religion and country fashions to serve him the better to his purpose: yet it is not to be thought that Daniel learned any knowledge that was not godly. In all points he refused the abuse of things and superstition, insomuch that he would not eat the meat which the King appointed him, but was content to learn the knowledge of natural things.</note> learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a <note>That by their good entertainment they might learn to forget the mediocrity of their own people.</note> daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them <note>With the intent that in this time they might learn both the manners of the Chaldeans, and also their language.</note> three years, that at the end thereof they might stand <note>As well as to serve at the table as in other offices.</note> before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Nowe among these were certeine of the children of Iudah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs <note>That they might altogether forget their religion: for the Jews gave their children names which might always put them in remembrance of some point of religion. Therefore this was a great temptation and a sign of servitude, which they were not able to resist.</note> gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not <note>Not that he thought any religion to be in the meat or drink (for afterwards he did eat), but because the king should not entice him by this sweet poison to forget his religion and accustomed sobriety, and that in his meat and drink he might daily remember of what people he was from. And Daniel brings this in to show how God from the beginning assisted him with his Spirit, and at length called him to be a Prophet.</note> defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>(Nowe God had brought Daniel into fauour, and tender loue with the chiefe of the Eunuches)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, <note>He supposed they did this for their religion, which was contrary to the Babylonians, and therefore in this he represents those who are of no religion: for neither would he condemn theirs, nor maintain his own.</note> I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall ye make [me] endanger my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then sayd Daniel to Melzar, whome the chiefe of the Eunuches had set ouer Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, <note>Meaning that within this space he might have the test, and that no man would be able to know about it: and thus he spoke, being moved by the Spirit of God.</note> ten days; and let them give us <note>Not that it was a thing abominable to eat dainty meats, and to drink wine, as both before and after they did, but if they would have by this been won to the King, and had refused their own religion, that meat and drink would have been accursed.</note> pulse to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances bee looked vpon before thee, and the countenances of the children that eate of the portion of the Kings meate: and as thou seest, deale with thy seruantes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So hee consented to them in this matter, an proued them ten dayes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their <note>This bare feeding and that also of Moses, when he fled from the court of Egypt, declares that we must live in such sobriety as God calls us to, seeing that he will make it more profitable to us than all dainties: for his blessing alone suffices.</note> countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar tooke away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drinke, and gaue them pulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning <note>Meaning in the liberal sciences, and natural knowledge, and not in the magical areas which are forbidden; (Deu_18:11).</note> and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all <note>So that he alone was a Prophet, and none of the others: for by dreams and visions God appeared to his Prophets; (Num_12:6)</note> visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the <note>Of the three years mentioned above as in (Dan_1:5).</note> end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the King communed with them: and among them al was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stoode they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisedome, and vnderstanding that the King enquired of them, hee founde them tenne times better then all the inchanters and astrologians, that were in all his realme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued [even] unto <note>That is, he was esteemed in Babylon as a Prophet as long as that commonwealth stood.</note> the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the <note>The father and the son were both called by this name, so that this is meant of the son, when he reigned alone: for he also reigned in a way with his father.</note> second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed <note>Not that he had many dreams, but because many matters were contained in this dream.</note> dreams, wherewith his spirit was <note>Because it was so rare and strange a dream, that he had had nothing similar.</note> troubled, and <note>Or, «his sleep was upon him», that is, that he was so heavy with sleep, that he began to sleep again.</note> his sleep brake from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the <note>For all these astrologers and sorcerers called themselves by this name of honour, as though all the wisdom and knowledge of the country depended upon them, and that all other countries were void of such wisdom and knowledge.</note> Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the King sayde vnto them, I haue dreamed a dreame, and my spirite was troubled to knowe the dreame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in <note>That is, in the Syrian language, which differed not much from the Chaldeans, except it seemed to be more eloquent, and therefore the learned used to speak it, as the Jewish writers do to this day.</note> Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye <note>This is a just reward of their arrogance (who boasted of themselves that they had knowledge of all things), that they should be proved fools, and that to their perpetual shame and confusion.</note> shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if yee declare the dreame and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receyue of me gifts and rewardes, and great honour: therefore shewe me the dreame and the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said, Let the king tell <note>In this appears their ignorance, that despite their braggings, yet they were not able to tell the dream, unless he told them of it. And if he did tell them, they would pretend knowledge where there was but mere ignorance, and so as deluders of the people they were worthy to die.</note> his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>Then the King answered, and sayd, I knowe certeinly that ye would gaine the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if ye will not declare mee the dreame, there is but one iudgement for you: for ye haue prepared lying and corrupt wordes, to speake before me till the time bee changed: therefore tell me the dreame, that I may knowe, if yee can declare me the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>Then the Caldeans answered before the King, and sayde, There is no man vpon earth that can declare the Kings matter: yea, there is neither king nor prince nor lorde that asked such things at an inchanter or astrologian or Caldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>For it is a rare thing that the King requireth, and there is none other that can declare it before the King, except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angrie and in great furie, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise [men] should be slain; and they <note>Which declares that God would not have his servant united in the company of these sorcerers and astrologers, whose arts were wicked, and therefore justly ought to die, even though the king did it upon a rage and not from zeal.</note> sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisedome to Arioch the Kings chiefe stewarde, which was gone foorth to put to death the wise men of Babel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>Yea, he answered and sayde vnto Arioch the kings captaine, Why is the sentence so hastie from the king? Then Arioch declared the thing to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>So Daniel went and desired the king that he woulde giue him leasure and that he woulde shewe the king the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>The Daniel went to his house &amp; shewed the matter to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah his companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>That they should beseech the God of heauen for grace in this secrete, that Daniel and his fellowes should not perish with the rest of ye wise men of Babel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret reueiled vnto Daniel in a vision by night: therefore Daniel praysed the God of heauen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>And Daniel answered and sayde, The Name of God be praysed for euer and euer: for wisedome and strength are his,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And hee changeth the times &amp; seasons: he taketh away kings: he setteth vp kings: he giueth wisedome vnto the wise, and vnderstanding to those that vnderstand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what [is] in the darkness, and the <note>He shows that man has neither wisdom nor knowledge, but very dark blindness and ignorance of himself: for it comes only from God that man understands anything.</note> light dwelleth with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my <note>To whom you made your promise, and who lived in fear of you: by which he excludes all other gods.</note> fathers, who hast given me wisdom and <note>Meaning power to interpret it.</note> might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast [now] made known unto us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise [men] of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not <note>By which appears that many were slain, as in verse thirteen, and the rest at Daniel's offer were preserved on condition. Not that Daniel favoured their wicked profession, but that he had respect to fairness, because the King proceeded according to his wicked affection, and not considering if their profession was morally correct or not.</note> the wise [men] of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought Daniel before the King in all haste, and sayd thus vnto him, I haue found a man of the children of Iudah that were brought captiues, that will declare vnto the King the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>Then answered the King, and sayde vnto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to shew me the dreame, which I haue seene, and the interpretation thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the King, and sayd, The secret which the King hath demanded, can neither the wise, the astrologians, the inchanters, nor the southsayers declare vnto the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in <note>He affirms that man by reason and craft is not able to attain to the cause of God's secrets, but the understanding only of them must come from God: by which he smites the king with a certain fear and reverence of God, that he might be the more able to receive the high mysteries that would be revealed.</note> heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>O King, when thou wast in thy bedde, thoughts came into thy mind, what should come to passe hereafter, and he that reueyleth secretes, telleth thee, what shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as <note>Because he had said that God alone must reveal the signification of this dream, the King might have asked why Daniel undertook to interpret it: and therefore he shows that he was but God's minister, and had no gifts but those which God had given him to set forth his glory.</note> for me, this secret is not revealed to me for [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but for [their] sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>O King, thou sawest, and beholde, there was a great image: this great image whose glory was so excellent, stood before thee, &amp; the forme thereof was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>This image's head [was] of fine <note>By gold, silver, brass, and iron are meant the Chaldean, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman kingdoms, which would successively rule all the world until Christ (who is here called the stone) himself comes, and destroys the last. And this was to assure the Jews that their affliction would not end with the empire of the Chaldeans, but that they should patiently await the coming of the Messiah, who would be at the end of this fourth monarchy.</note> gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>His legges of yron, and his feete were part of yron, and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou beheldest it til a stone was cut without hands, which smote the image vpon his feete, that were of yron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer and the golde broken all together, and became like the chaffe of the sommer floures, and the winde caryed them away, that no place was founde for them: and the stone that smote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dreame, and we will declare before the King the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>O King, thou art a king of Kings: for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power, and strength, and glorie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou [art] <note>Daniel leaves out the kingdom of the Assyrians, which was before the Babylonian, both because it was not a monarchy and general empire, and also because he would declare the things that were to come, until the coming of Christ, for the comfort of the elect among these wonderful alterations. And he calls the Babylonian kingdom the golden head, because in respect of the other three, it was the best, and yet it was of itself wicked and cruel.</note> this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after thee shall arise another kingdom <note>Meaning, the Persians who were not inferior in dignity, power, or riches, but were worse with regard to ambition, cruelty, and every type of vice, showing that the world would grow worse and worse, until it was restored by Christ.</note> inferior to thee, and another <note>That is, those of the Macedonians will be of brass, not alluding to the hardness of it, but to the vileness with regard to silver.</note> third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all [things]: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in <note>That is, the Roman empire will subdue all these others, which after Alexander were divided into the Macedonians, Grecians, Syrians, and Egyptians.</note> pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be <note>They will have civil wars, and continual discords among themselves.</note> divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feete were parte of yron, and parte of clay, so shall the kingdome be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with <note>They will be marriages and affinities think to make themselves strong: yet they will never by united in heart.</note> the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which <note>His purpose is to show that all the kingdoms of the world are transitory, and that the kingdom of Christ alone will remain forever.</note> shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, [but] it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the <note>Meaning Christ, who was sent by God, and not set up by man, whose kingdom at the beginning would be small and without beauty to man's judgment, but would at length grow and fill the whole earth, which he calls a great mountain, as in (Dan_2:35). And this kingdom, which is not only referred to the person of Christ, but also to the whole body of his Church, and to every member of it, will be eternal: for the Spirit that is in them is eternal life; (Rom_8:10).</note> stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream [is] certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and <note>Though this humbling of the king seemed to deserve commendation, yet because he united God's honour with the Prophets, it is to be reproved, and Daniel would have erred, if he allowed it: but it is to his credit that Daniel admonished him of his fault, and did not allow it.</note> worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>At the same time I Daniel was in heauines for three weekes of dayes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint my selfe at all, till three weekes of dayes were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'>And in the four and twentieth day of the <note>Called Abib, which contains part of March, and part of April.</note> first month, as I <note>Being carried by the Spirit of prophecy so that he could see the river Tigris.</note> was by the side of the great river, which [is] Hiddekel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man <note>This was the angel of God, who was sent to assure Daniel in this prophecy that follows.</note> clothed in linen, whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>His body also was like the Chrysolite, and his face (to looke vpon) like the lightning, &amp; his eyes as lamps of fire, and his armes and his feete were like in colour to polished brasse, &amp; the voyce of his wordes was like the voyce of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I Daniel alone sawe the vision: for the men that were with me, sawe not the vision: but a great feare fell vpon them, so that they fled away and hid themselues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for <note>So that because of fear he was like a dead man because of his deformity.</note> my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>Yet heard I the voyce of his wordes: and when I heard the voyce of his wordes, I slept on my face: and my face was toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And, behold, an <note>Which declares that when we are struck down with the majesty of God we cannot rise, unless he also lifts us up with his hand, which is his power.</note> hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and [upon] the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he sayde vnto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloued, vnderstand the wordes that I speake vnto thee, and stand in thy place: for vnto thee am I nowe sent; when hee had sayde this worde vnto me, I stood trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>Then sayd he vnto me, Feare not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou diddest set thine heart to vnderstand, and to humble thy selfe before thy God, thy wordes were heard, and I am come for thy wordes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the <note>Meaning Cambyses, who reigned in his father's absence, and did not only for this time hinder the building of the temple, but would have further raged, if God had not sent me to resist him: and therefore I have stayed for the profit of the Church.</note> prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, <note>Even though God could by one angel destroy all the world, yet to assure his children of his love he sends forth double power, even Michael, that is, Christ Jesus the head of angels.</note> Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.14'>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the <note>For even though the Prophet Daniel would end and cease, yet his doctrine would continue until the coming of Christ, for the comfort of his Church.</note> vision [is] for [many] days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.15'>And when he spake these wordes vnto me, I set my face towarde the grounde, and helde my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'>And, behold, <note>This was the same angel that spoke with him before in the appearance of a man.</note> [one] like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, <note>I was overcome with fear and sorrow, when I saw the vision.</note> by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'>For howe can the seruant of this my Lorde talke with my Lord being such one? for as for me, straight way there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.18'>Then there came againe, and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.19'>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: <note>He declares by this that God would be merciful to the people of Israel.</note> peace [be] unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I <note>Which declares that when God smites his children down, he does not immediately lift them up at once (for now the Angel had touched him twice), but by little and little.</note> was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.20'>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the <note>Meaning that he would not only himself bridle the rage of Cambyses, but also the other kings of Persia by Alexander the King of Macedonia.</note> prince of Grecia shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.21'>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: <note>For this angel was appointed for the defence of the Church under Christ, who is the head of it.</note> and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</verse>
