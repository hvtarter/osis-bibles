Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, of which the first was their captain to bring them home, and provided that the temple was built: the second reformed their manners and planted religion: and the third built up the walls, delivered the people from oppression and provided that the law of God was carried out among them. He was a godly man, and in great authority with the king, so that the king favoured him greatly and gave him letters to accomplish all the things he desired. This book is also called the second of Ezra by the Latins because he was the author of it.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>That Hanani, one of my <note>A Jew as I was.</note> brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the <note>Meaning in Judea.</note> province [are] in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also [is] broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And when I heard these wordes, I sate downe and wept, and mourned certeine dayes, &amp; I fasted and prayed before the God of heauen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And sayde, O Lorde God of heauen, the great and terrible God, that keepeth couenant and mercy for them that loue him, and obserue his commandements,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>I pray thee, let thine eares be attet, &amp; thine eies open, to heare the praier of thy seruat, which I pray before thee dayly, day &amp; night for ye childre of Israel thy seruats, &amp; confesse the sinnes of the children of Israel, which we haue sinned against thee, both I and my fathers house haue sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We haue grieuously sinned against thee, and haue not kept the commandements, nor the statutes, nor the iudgements, which thou commandedst thy seruant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>I beseeche thee, remember the worde that thou commandedst thy seruant Moses, saying, Ye wil transgresse, and I will scatter you abroade among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>But if ye turne vnto me, &amp; keepe my commandements, and doe them, though your scattering were to the vttermost part of the heauen, yet will I gather you from thence, and will bring you vnto the place that I haue chosen to place my Name there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are thy seruants and thy people, whome thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy mightie hand.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month <note>Which was the first month of the year, and contains part of March and part of April.</note> Nisan, in the twentieth year of <note>Who is also called Darius, (Ezr_7:1) and was the son of Hystaspis.</note> Artaxerxes the king, [that] wine [was] before him: and I took up the wine, and gave [it] unto the king. Now I had not been [beforetime] sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said vnto me, Why is thy coutenance sad, seeing thou art not sicke? this is nothing, but sorow of heart. Then was I sore afrayd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said to the King, God saue the King for euer: why should not my countenance be sad, when the citie &amp; house of the sepulchres of my fathers lieth waste, and the gates thereof are deuoured with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed <note>I desired God in my heart to prosper my enterprise.</note> to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And sayde vnto the King, If it please the King, and if thy seruant haue found fauour in thy sight, I desire that thou wouldest send me to Iudah vnto the city of the sepulchres of my fathers, that I may buyld it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the King sayd vnto me, (the Queene also sitting by him) How long shall thy iourney be? &amp; when wilt thou come againe? So it pleased the King, and he sent me, and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>After I saide vnto the King, If it please the King, let them giue mee letters to the captaines beyond the Riuer, that they may conuay me ouer, till I come into Iudah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [appertained] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to <note>As God moved me to ask, and as he gave me success in it.</note> the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then came I to the captaines beyonde the Riuer, and gaue them the Kings letters; the King had sent captaines of the armie and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>When <note>These were great enemies to the Jews, and laboured always both by force and subtilty to overcome them and Tobiah, because his wife was a Jewess, knew of their affairs and so brought them great trouble.</note> Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard [of it], it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Ierusalem, &amp; was there three dayes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I rose in the night, I, and a fewe men with me: for I told no man, what God had put in mine heart to do at Ierusalem, &amp; there was not a beast with me, saue the beast whereon I rode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, &amp; came before the draggon well, and to the dung porte, and vewed the walles of Ierusalem, howe they were broken downe, and the portes thereof deuoured with the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went foorth vnto the gate of the fountaine, and to the Kings fishpoole, and there was no rowme for the beast that was vnder me to passe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I vp in ye night by the brooke, and viewed the wall, and turned backe, and comming backe, I entred by the gate of the valley &amp; returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers knewe not whither I was gone, nor what I did, neither did I as yet tell it vnto the Iewes, nor to the Priestes, nor to the noble men, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that laboured in the worke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem [lieth] waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more <note>That is, contemned by other nations as though God had forsaken us.</note> a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they <note>They were encouraged and gave themselves to do well, and to travel in this worthy enterprise.</note> strengthened their hands for [this] good [work].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and <note>These were three chief governors under the king of Persia beyond the Euphrates.</note> Geshem the Arabian, heard [it], they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What [is] this thing that ye do? will ye <note>Thus the wicked when they will burden the children of God, always lay treason to their charge both because it makes them most odious to the world, and also stirs the hatred of princes against them.</note> rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor <note>Neither are you of the number of the children of God (to whom he has appointed this city only) neither did any of your predecessors ever fear God.</note> memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>Bvt when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, then was he wroth and sore grieued, and mocked the Iewes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spake before his <note>Of his companions who dwelt in Samaria.</note> brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these <note>Thus the wicked who do not consider that God's power is always ready to defend his, mock them as thought they were weak and feeble.</note> feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and said, Although they buylde, yet if a foxe goe vp, he shall euen breake downe their stonie wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>
          <note>This is the remedy that the children of God have against the derision and threatenings of their enemies, to flee to God by prayer.</note>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey <note>Let them be spoiled and led away captive.</note> in the land of captivity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>And cover not their <note>Let the plagues declare to the world that they set themselves against you and your Church: that he prays only having respect for God's glory and not for any private affection, or grudge.</note> iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall, and all the wall was ioyned vnto the halfe thereof, and the heart of the people was to worke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But when Sanballat, &amp; Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodims heard that the walles of Ierusalem were repayred, (for the breaches began to be stopped) then they were very wroth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>And conspired all together to come &amp; to fight against Ierusalem, and to hinder them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>The we prayed vnto our God, &amp; set watchmen by them, day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Iudah said, The strength of the bearers is weakened, and there is much earth, so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>Also our aduersaries had sayde, They shall not knowe, neither see, till we come into the middes of them and slay them, and cause the worke to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us <note>That is, often.</note> ten times, <note>They who brought the tidings said this, when you leave your work, and go either to eat or to rest, your enemies will assail you.</note> From all places whence ye shall return unto us [they will be upon you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall vpon the toppes of the stones, &amp; placed the people by their families, with their swordes, their speares and their bowes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: <note>Who is always on hand to deliver his out of danger: and therefore seeing they should fight for the maintenance of God's glory, and for the preservation of their own lives and of theirs, he encourages them to play the valiant men.</note> remember the Lord, [which is] great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs, then God brought their counsell to nought, and we turned all againe to the wall, euery one vnto his worke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth, [that] the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers [were] <note>To overcome them and encourage them in their work.</note> behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They that buylded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, and they that laded, did the worke with one hand, and with the other helde the sworde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>For euery one of the buylders had his sworde girded on his loynes, and so buylded: and he that blewe the trumpet, was beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>Then saide I vnto the Princes, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The worke is great and large, and we are separated vpon the wall, one farre from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In what place [therefore] ye hear the sound of the trumpet, <note>Meaning, to resist their enemies, if need be.</note> resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we laboured in the worke, and halfe of them helde the speares, from the appearing of the morning, till the starres came foorth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>And at the same time said I vnto the people, Let euery one with his seruant lodge within Ierusalem, that they may be a watch for vs in the night, and labour in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, [saving that] every one put them off <note>That is, when they purified themselves or else when they washed their clothes.</note> for washing.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives <note>Against the rich who oppressed them.</note> against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, [are] many: therefore we take up <note>This is the complaint of the people, showing the extremity they were brought to.</note> corn [for them], that we may eat, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And there were that saide, We must gage our landes, and our vineyardes, and our houses, and take vp corne for the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's <note>To pay our tribute to the king of the Persians, which was exacted yearly from us.</note> tribute, [and that upon] our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh [is] as <note>By nature the rich are no better than the poor.</note> the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and [some] of our daughters are brought unto bondage [already]: neither [is it] in our power <note>We are not able to redeem them, but out of poverty are forced to sell them to others.</note> [to redeem them]; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>Then was I very angrie when I heard their crie and these wordes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye <note>You press them with usury, and seek to bring all thing into your hands.</note> exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great <note>Both because they should be moved with pity seeing how many were oppressed by them, and also hear the judgment of others, who should be witnesses of their dealings with their brethren.</note> assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be <note>Seeing God has once delivered them from the bondage of the heathen, shall we make them our slaves?</note> sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing [to answer].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>
          <note>Meaning, Nehemiah.</note>Also I said, It [is] not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the <note>Who by this occasion will blaspheme the Name of God, seeing that our actions are no better than theirs.</note> reproach of the heathen our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>For euen I, my brethren, and my seruants doe lende them money and corne: I pray you, let vs leaue off this burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, <note>Which you take from them for the loan.</note> that ye exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then said they, We will restore it, and will not require it of them: we will doe as thou hast said. Then I called the Priestes, and caused them to sweare, that they shoulde doe according to this promes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>So I shooke my lappe, and said, So let God shake out euery man that wil not perfourme this promise from his house, &amp; from his labour: euen thus let him be shaken out, &amp; emptied; all the Cogregation said, Amen, &amp; praised the Lord: and the people did according to this promes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the <note>I did not receive the portion and diet which the governors who were before me exacted, in which he declares that he rather sought the wealth of the people than his own convenience.</note> bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>For the former gouernours that were before me, had bene chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides fourtie shekels of siluer: yea, and their seruants bare rule ouer the people: but so did not I, because of the feare of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>But rather I fortified a portio in the worke of this wall, and we bought no lande, and all my seruants came thither together vnto the worke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreouer there were at my table an hundreth &amp; fiftie of the Iewes, &amp; rulers, which came vnto vs from among the heathen that are about vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now [that] which was prepared [for me] daily [was] one ox [and] six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of <note>While at other times they had by measure, at this time they had most liberally.</note> all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember me, O my God, in goodnesse, according to all that I haue done for this people.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and [that] there was no <note>That is, that they were joined together, as in (Neh_4:6).</note> breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>Then sent Sanballat and Geshem vnto me, saying, Come thou that we may meete together in the villages in the plaine of Ono: and they thought to doe me euill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I [am] doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: <note>Meaning, that if he obeyed their request, the work God had appointed would cease: showing by this that we should not commit ourselves to the hands of the wicked.</note> why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>Yet they sent vnto me foure times after this sort; I answered them after the same maner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then sent Sanballat his seruant after this sorte vnto me the fift time, with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>Wherein [was] written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith [it, that] thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these <note>As the same goes.</note> words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And thou hast also appointed <note>You have bribed and set up false prophets, to make yourself king, and so to defraud the king of Persia of that subjection which you owe to him.</note> prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, [There is] a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent vnto him, saying, It is not done according to these wordes that thou sayest: for thou feynest them of thine owne heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For all they afrayed vs, saying, Their handes shalbe weakened from the worke, and it shall not be done: nowe therefore incourage thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who [was] <note>As though he would be secret, to the intent that he might pray to God with greater liberty, and receive some revelation, which in him was only hypocrisy.</note> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, <note>He did not doubt that God was able to preserve him and knew that if he had obeyed this counsel he would have discouraged all the people: thus God gives power to his to resist false prophecies, though they seem to have great probability.</note> Should such a man as I flee? and who [is there], that, [being] as I [am], would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And loe, I perceiued, that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecie against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>Therefore was he hyred, that I might be afrayde, and doe thus, and sinne, and that they might haue an euill report that they might reproche me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the <note>Grief caused him to pray against such, who under the pretence of being the ministers of God, were adversaries to his glory, and went about to overthrow his Church, declaring also by this that where there is one true minister of God, the devil has many hirelings.</note> prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] <note>Which was the sixth month and contained part of August, and part of September.</note> Elul, in <note>After I had sent Sanballat his answer.</note> fifty and two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And when all our enemies heard thereof, euen all the heathen that were about vs, they were afraid, &amp; their courage failed them: for they knew, that this worke was wrought by our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many <note>Thus the Church of God always has enemies within itself, which is more dangerous than outward and professed enemies.</note> letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Iudah, that were sworne vnto him: for he was the sonne in lawe of Shechaniah, the sonne of Arah: and his sonne Iehonathan had the daughter of Meshullam, the sonne of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Yea, they spake in his praise before me, &amp; tolde him my wordes, and Tobiah sent letters to put me in feare.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Nowe when the wall was builded, and I had set vp the doores, and the porters, and the singers and the Leuites were appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>Then I commanded my brother Hanani and Hananiah the prince of the palace in Ierusalem (for he was doubtlesse a faithfull man, and feared God aboue many)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while <note>That is, they who are mentioned, (Neh_7:2).</note> they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar [them]: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.2'>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: and our God turned the curse into a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.3'>Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel <note>That is, all who had joined in unlawful marriage and also those with whom God had forbidden them to mingle with.</note> all the mixed multitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.6'>But in all this [time] was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of <note>Called also Darius, (Ezr_6:1).</note> Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.7'>And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of <note>Thus we see to what inconveniences the people fall into when they are destitute of one who fears God, seeing that their chief governor was absent only for a little while and yet they fell into such great absurdities: as appears in, (Exo_32:1).</note> the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>And it grieued me sore: therefore I cast forth all the vessels of the house of Tobiah out of the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>And I commanded them to clense ye chambers: and thither brought I againe the vessels of the house of God with the meate offring and the incense.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>Then reproued I the rulers and sayd, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I assembled them, and set them in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>Then brought all Iudah the tithes of corne and of wine, and of oyle vnto the treasures.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days saw I in Judah [some] treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all [manner of] burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and <note>I declared to them that God would not allow such transgressors of his law to go unpunished.</note> I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>There dwelt men of Tyrus also therein, which brought fish and all wares, and solde on the Sabbath vnto the children of Iudah euen in Ierusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be <note>About the time that the sun went down, for the sabbath lasted from the sun setting one day, to the sun setting the next day.</note> dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and [some] of my servants set I at the gates, [that] there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the chapmen and marchants of al marchandise remained once or twise all night without Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>And I protested among them, and said vnto them, Why tary ye all night about the wall? If ye do it once againe, I will lay hands vpon you. from that time came they no more on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and [that] they should come [and] <note>Meaning, of the temple that none that was unclean should enter.</note> keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and <note>That is, I excommunicated them and drove them out of the congregation.</note> cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Salomon the king of Israel sinne by these thinges? yet among many nations was there no King like him: for he was beloued of his God, and God had made him King ouer Israel: yet strange women caused him to sinne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall wee then obey vnto you, to doe all this great euil, and to transgresse against our God, euen to marry strange wiues?</verse>
