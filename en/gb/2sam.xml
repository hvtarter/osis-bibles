  <div type='book' osisID='2Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; <note>The Argument - This book and the former are called Samuel, because they contain the conception, birth and the whole course of his life, and also the lives and acts of two kings, that is, of Saul and David, whom he anointed and consecrated kings by the ordinance of God. The first book contains those things which God brought to pass among this people under the government of Samuel and Saul. This second book declares the noble acts of David, after the death of Saul when he began to reign, to the end of his kingdom, and how it was expanded by him. It also contains the great troubles and dangers he sustained both within his house and without, the horrible and dangerous insurrections, uproars, and treasons wrought against him, partly by false counsellors, feigned friends and flatterers and partly by his own children and people. By God's assistance he overcame all difficulties, and enjoyed his kingdom in rest and peace. In the person of David the scripture sets forth Christ Jesus the chief king, who came from David according to the flesh, and was persecuted on every side with outward and inward enemies, as well in his own person, as in his members, but at length he overcomes all his enemies, and gives his Church victory against all power both spiritual and temporal; and so reigns with them, king for ever.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with <note>Seeming to lament the overthrow of the people of Israel.</note> his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and [so] it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>Then Dauid saide vnto him, Whence commest thou? And he said vnto him, Out of the host of Israel I am escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And Dauid saide vnto him, What is done? I pray thee, tell me. Then he said, that the people is fled from the battel, and many of the people are ouerthrowen, and dead, &amp; also Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>And Dauid saide vnto the yong man that tolde it him, Howe knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man that told him said, <note>As I fled the chase.</note> As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked backe, he saw me, and called me; I answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said unto me, Who [art] thou? And I answered him, I [am] an <note>He was an Amalekite born, but renounced his country and joined with the Israelites.</note> Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my <note>I am sorry, because I am yet alive.</note> life [is] yet whole in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I came vpon him, and slewe him, and because I was sure that hee coulde not liue, after that hee had fallen, I tooke the crowne that was vpon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arme, and brought them hither vnto my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes, &amp; rent them, and likewise al the men that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>And they mourned and wept, and fasted vntil euen, for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne, &amp; for the people of the Lorde, and for the house of Israel, because they were slaine with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>
          <note>After the lamentation, he examined him again.</note>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence [art] thou? And he answered, I [am] the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And Dauid said vnto him, How wast thou not afrayd, to put forth thine hand to destroy the Anoynted of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>Then Dauid called one of his yong men, and said, Goe neere, and fall vpon him; hee smote him that he dyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said unto him, <note>You are justly punished for your fault.</note> Thy blood [be] upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>Then Dauid mourned with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his sonne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <note>That they might be able to match their enemies the Philistines in that art.</note> [the use of] the bow: behold, [it is] written in the book of Jasher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>The beauty of Israel is <note>Meaning Saul.</note> slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, nor publish it in the streetes of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistims reioyce, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>Ye mountains of Gilboa, [let there be] no dew, neither [let there be] rain, upon you, nor <note>Let their fertile fields be barren, and bring forth no fruit to offer to the Lord.</note> fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, [as though he had] not [been] anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>The bow of Ionathan neuer turned backe, neither did the sword of Saul returne emptie from the blood of the slaine, and from the fatte of the mightie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>Saul and Jonathan [were] lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not <note>They died both together in Gilboa.</note> divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, <note>As rich garments and costly jewels.</note> with [other] delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>Howe were the mightie slaine in the mids of the battel! O Ionathan, thou wast slaine in thine hie places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of <note>Either toward their husbands or their children.</note> women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>Howe are the mightie ouerthrowen, and the weapons of warre destroyed!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>And it came to pass after this, that David <note>By means of the high priest, (1Sa_23:2; 2Sa_5:19).</note> enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto <note>Which was also called Kirjatharba (Jos_14:15).</note> Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So Dauid went vp thither, and his two wiues also, Ahinoam the Izreelite, and Abigail Nabals wife the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And his men that [were] with <note>In the time of his persecution.</note> him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>Then the men of Iudah came, and there they anoynted Dauid King ouer the house of Iudah; they tolde Dauid, saying, that the men of Iabesh Gilead buried Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>And Dauid sent messengers vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead, and said vnto them, Blessed are ye of the Lord, that yee haue shewed such kindenes vnto your lord Saul, that you haue buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And now the LORD shew kindness and <note>According to his promise, which is to repay those who are merciful.</note> truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me <note>So that you shall not want a captain and a defender.</note> king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>But Abner the sonne of Ner that was captaine of Sauls hoste, tooke Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul, and brought him to Mahanaim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over <note>Over the eleven tribes.</note> all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne was fourtie yeere olde wen he began to reigne ouer Israel, and reigned two yeere: but the house of Iudah followed Dauid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six <note>After this he reigned over all the country 33 years, (2Sa_5:5).</note> months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And Abner the sonne of Ner, and the seruantes of Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul went out of Mahanaim to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and the seruants of Dauid went out and met one another by the poole of Gibeon: and they sate downe, the one on the one side of the poole, and the other on the otherside of the poole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and <note>Let us see how they can handle their weapons.</note> play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then there arose and went ouer twelue of Beniamin by number, which perteined to Ish-bosheth the sonne of Saul, and twelue of the seruants of Dauid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And they caught every one his <note>Meaning his adversary.</note> fellow by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which [is] in Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, <note>After that these four and twenty were slain.</note> before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And there were three sonnes of Zeruiah there, Ioab, and Abishai, and Asahel; Asahel was as light on foote as a wilde roe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>And Asahel followed after Abner, and in going he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, Yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>Then Abner said, Turne thee either to the right hande, or to the left, and take one of the yong men, and take thee his weapons: and Asahel would not depart from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: <note>Why do you provoke me to kill you?</note> wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the <note>Some read, in those parts where the lively parts lie, the heart, lungs, liver, and gall bladder.</note> fifth [rib], that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, [that] as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>Ioab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sunne went downe, when they were come to the hill Ammah, that lieth before Giah, by the way of the wildernesse of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the children of Beniamin gathered them selues together after Abner, and were on an heape and stoode on the top of an hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the <note>Shall we not make an end of murdering?</note> sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Joab said, [As] God liveth, unless thou hadst <note>If you had not provoked them to battle, (2Sa_2:14).</note> spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Ioab blew a trumpet, and all the people stoode still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plaine, and went ouer Iorden, and past through all Bithron till they came to Mahanaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>Ioab also returned backe from Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Dauids seruants nineteene men and Asahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three <note>Thus God would confirm David in his kingdom by the destruction of his adversaries.</note> hundred and threescore men died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they tooke vp Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem: and Ioab and his men went all night, &amp; when they came to Hebron, the day arose.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>Now there was <note>That is, without intermission enduring two years, which was the whole reign of Ishbosheth.</note> long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And vnto Dauid were children borne in Hebron: and his eldest sonne was Amnon of Ahinoam the Izreelite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And his second, <note>Who is also called Daniel, (1Ch_3:1).</note> Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And the fourth, Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith, and the fifth, Shephatiah the sonne of Abital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in <note>Within seven years and six months.</note> Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>Nowe while there was warre betweene the house of Saul and the house of Dauid, Abner made all his power for the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiiah; Ish-bosheth sayde to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in to my fathers concubine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, [Am] I a <note>Do you esteem me no more than a dog, for all my service done to your father's house?</note> dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>
          <note>We see how the wicked cannot abide being admonished about their faults, but seek their displeasure, who go about to bring them from their wickedness.</note>So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>To remoue the kingdome from the house of Saul, that the throne of Dauid may be stablished ouer Israel, and ouer Iudah, euen from Dan to Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And he durst no more answere to Abner: for he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>Then Abner sent messengers to Dauid on his behalfe, saying, Whose is the lande? who should also say, Make couenant with me, and beholde, mine hande shalbe with thee, to bring all Israel vnto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>Who saide, Well, I will make a couenant with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, that thou see not my face except thou bring Michal Sauls daughter when thou commest to see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>Then Dauid sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne, saying, Deliuer me my wife Michal, which I marryed for an hundreth foreskinnes of the Philistims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ish-bosheth sent, and tooke her from her husband Phaltiel the sonne of Laish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And her husband went with her, &amp; came weeping behinde her, vnto Bahurim: then saide Abner vnto him, Go, and returne. So he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner had <note>Rather for malice that he bore toward Ishbosheth, than for love he bore to David.</note> communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past [to be] king over you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Nowe then doe it: for the Lord hath spoken of Dauid, saying, By the hand of my seruant Dauid I will saue my people Israel out of the handes of the Philistims, and out of the handes of all their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole <note>Who challenged the kingdom, because of their father Saul.</note> house of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>So Abner came to Dauid to Hebron, hauing twentie men with him, and Dauid made a feast vnto Abner, and to the men that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>Then Abner sayde vnto Dauid, I will rise vp, and goe gather all Israel vnto my lorde the King, that they may make a couenant with thee, and that thou mayest reigne ouer all that thine heart desireth. Then Dauid let Abner depart, who went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came <note>From war against the Philistines.</note> from [pursuing] a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner [was] not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Ioab, &amp; all the hoste that was with him were come, men tolde Ioab, saying, Abner the sonne of Ner came to the King, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Joab came to the king, and said, <note>Here appears the malicious mind of Joab, who would have had the king slay Abner for his private grudge.</note> What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why [is] it [that] thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner: for he came to deceiue thee, and to knowe thy outgoing and ingoing, and to knowe all that thou doest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And when Ioab was gone out from Dauid, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him againe from the well of Siriah vnknowing to Dauid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner was come againe to Hebron, Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him peaceably, and smote him vnder the fift ryb, that he dyed, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are] <note>the Lord knows that I did not consent to his death.</note> guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Let the blood fall on the head of Ioab, and on all his fathers house, that the house of Ioab be neuer without some that haue running issues, or leper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or that doeth fall on the sworde, or that lacketh bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Joab and <note>Abishai is said to slay him with Joab, because he consented to the murder.</note> Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn <note>Meaning before the corpse.</note> before Abner. And king David [himself] followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And when they had buryed Abner in Hebron, the King lift vp his voyce, and wept beside the sepulchre of Abner, and all the people wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>So Gad came the same day to Dauid, and said vnto him, Go vp, reare an altar vnto the Lord in the threshing floore of Araunah the Iebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>And Dauid (according to the saying of Gad) went vp, as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And Araunah looked, and sawe the King and his seruants comming towarde him, and Araunah went out, and bowed himselfe before the King on his face to the ground,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>Then Araunah saide vnto Dauid, Let my lord the King take and offer what seemeth him good in his eyes: beholde the oxen for the burnt offring, and charets, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All these [things] did Araunah, <note>That is, abundantly, for as some write, he was king of Jerusalem before David won the tower.</note> [as] a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy [it] of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for <note>Some write that every tribe gave 50 which makes 600, or that afterward he bought as much as came to 550 shekels.</note> fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And Dauid built there an altar vnto the Lorde, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings, and the Lord was appeased toward ye lande, and the plague ceased from Israel.</verse>
