        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder unto the <note>This is not a proper name, but is to be taken as it sounds that is to say, the worthy and noble lady.</note> elect <note>Excellent and honourable woman.</note> lady and her children, <note>The bond of Christian union is the true and constant profession of the truth.</note> whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the trueths sake which dwelleth in vs, and shalbe with vs for euer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in <note>With true knowledge which always has love united with it, and following it.</note> truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>
          <note>This true profession consists both in love towards one another which the Lord has commanded, and also especially in wholesome and sound doctrine, which also is delivered to us: for the commandment of God is a sound and sure foundation both of the rule of conduct and of doctrine, and these cannot be separated from one another,</note>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in <note>According as the truth directs them.</note> truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And nowe beseeche I thee, Lady, (not as writing a newe commandement vnto thee, but that same which we had from the beginning) that we loue one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is that loue, that we should walke after his commandements. This commandement is, that as ye haue heard from the beginning, ye should walke in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>
          <note>Antichrists fighting against the person and office of Christ had already crept into the Church, in the time of the apostles.</note>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>
          <note>He that makes shipwreck of doctrine, loses all.</note>
          <note>Beware, and take good heed.</note>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whosoeuer transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Sonne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>
          <note>We should have nothing to do with those who defend perverse doctrine.</note>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into [your] house, neither bid him God speed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that biddeth him, God speede, is partaker of his euill deedes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Although I had many things to write vnto you, yet I woulde not write with paper &amp; ynke: but I trust to come vnto you, &amp; speake mouth to mouth, that our ioy may be full.</verse>
