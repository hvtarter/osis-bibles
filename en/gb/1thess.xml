  <div type='book' osisID='1Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Pavl, and Siluanus, and Timotheus, vnto the Church of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Iesus Christ: Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>
          <note>An example of proper Christian rejoicing, by which also we learn, that those who have great gifts in them, are in two ways governed: first, if they consider that they have received all from God, and second, that continuance must be desired at his hands. And to these things this whole epistle exhorts the Thessalonians.</note>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>
          <note>He commends them for three special gifts: effectual faith, continual love, and patient hope. And he does this to the end that they might be ashamed, being endued with such excellent gifts, not to continue in God's election.</note>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, brethren beloved, your <note>Literally, «that your election is of God».</note> election of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>
          <note>Another reason why they ought in no way start back but continue to the end, because they cannot doubt this doctrine which has been so many ways confirmed to them, even from heaven, as they themselves well knew.</note>For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in <note>Paul shows by two things that there followed very great fruit from his preaching, that is, by these gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that certain assurance which was thoroughly settled in their minds, as appeared by their willingly bearing the cross.</note> much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>
          <note>Another reason, because even to that day they embraced the Gospel with great cheerfulness, insomuch that they were an example to all their neighbours: so that it would be more shameful for them to faint in the middle of the race.</note>And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with <note>With joy which comes from the Holy Spirit.</note> joy of the Holy Ghost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that ye were as ensamples to all that beleeue in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you sounded out the worde of the Lord, not in Macedonia and in Achaia only: but your faith also which is toward God, spred abroad in all quarters, that we neede not to speake any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For <note>All the believers.</note> they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, <note>It is no true conversion to forsake idols, unless a man in addition worships the true and living God in Christ the only Redeemer.</note> and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from <note>This word «the» is not put here without reason: and by «wrath» is meant that revenge and punishment with which the Lord will in time judge the world in his terrible wrath.</note> the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For <note>That which he mentioned before briefly concerning his apostleship, he handles now more at large, and to that end and purpose which we spoke of.</note> yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>
          <note>The virtues of a true pastor are freely without fear to preach the Gospel, even in the midst of dangers.</note>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in <note>Through God's gracious help.</note> our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>
          <note>To teach pure doctrine faithfully and with a pure heart.</note>For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of <note>By any wicked and evil type of dealing.</note> uncleanness, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>
          <note>To approve his conscience to God, being free from all flattery and covetousness.</note>But as we were <note>There is this difference between the judgments of God and the judgments of men, that when men choose, they give regard to the qualities of those things which stand before them, but God finds the reason of his counsel only in himself. Therefore, it follows that seeing as we are not able to think a good thought, that whoever he first chooses to those callings, he does not find them able but indeed makes them able. And therefore in that we are empowered of God, it depends upon his mercy.</note> allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which <note>Who approves and allows them.</note> trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>Neither yet did we euer vse flattering wordes, as ye knowe, nor coloured couetousnes, God is recorde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>
          <note>To submit himself even to the basest, to win them, and to avoid all pride.</note>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been <note>When I might lawfully have lived upon the expenses of the churches.</note> burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were <note>We were rough, and yet easy and gentle as a nurse that is neither seeking glory, nor covetous, but who takes all pains as patiently as if she were a mother.</note> gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>
          <note>To consider the flock that is committed to him as more important than his own life.</note>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>
          <note>To let go of his own rights, rather than to be a cost to his sheep.</note>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>
          <note>To excel others in the example of a godly life.</note>Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>
          <note>To exhort and comfort with a fatherly mind and affection.</note>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>
          <note>To exhort all men diligently and earnestly to lead a godly life.</note>That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>
          <note>Having approved his ministry, he commends again (to that end and purpose that I spoke of) the cheerfulness of the Thessalonians which was due to his diligence in preaching, and their brave patience.</note>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>
          <note>He strengthens and encourages them in their afflictions which they suffered among their own people, because they were afflicted by their own countrymen. And this happened, he says, to the churches of the Jews, as well as to them: and therefore they ought to take it in good part.</note>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in <note>Which Christ has gathered together.</note> Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own <note>Even from those who are from the same country and the same town that you are from.</note> countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>
          <note>He prevents an offence which might be taken, because the Jews especially above all others persecuted the Gospel. That is no new thing, he says, seeing that they slew Christ himself, and his Prophets, and have banished me also.</note>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; <note>He foretells the utter destruction of the Jews, lest any man should be moved by their rebellion.</note> and they please not God, and are contrary to <note>For the Jews would neither enter into the kingdom of God themselves, nor allow others to enter in.</note> all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to <note>Until that wickedness of theirs which they have by inheritance as it were of their fathers, has grown so great, that the measure of their iniquity being filled, God may come forth to wrath.</note> fill up their sins alway: for the <note>The judgment of God who was angry, which indeed appeared shortly after in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, where many fled even out of various provinces, when it was besieged.</note> wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>
          <note>He meets with an objection, why he did not come to them immediately, being in such great misery: I often desired to, he says, and I was not able, but Satan hindered my endeavours, and therefore I sent Timothy my faithful companion to you, because you are most dear to me.</note>But we, brethren, <note>Were kept apart from you, and as it were orphans.</note> being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we would haue come vnto you (I Paul, at least once or twise) but Satan hindered vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope or ioye, or crowne of reioycing? are not euen you it in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ at his comming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>Yes, ye are our glory and ioy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore since we coulde no longer forbeare, wee thought it good to remaine at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And haue sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God, and our labour felow in the Gospel of Christ, to stablish you, and to comfort you touching your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: <note>The will of God, who calls his own on this condition, to bring them to glory by affliction, is a most sure remedy against all afflictions.</note> for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulations, euen as it came to passe, and ye knowe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Euen for this cause, when I could no longer forbeare, I sent him that I might knowe of your faith, lest the tempter had tempted you in any sort, and that our labour had bene in vaine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>
          <note>Because they have to this point gone so well forward, he exhorts them again to make an end of the rest of the journey, seeing that in doing so they will do him their apostle a great pleasure.</note>But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>Therefore, brethren, we had consolation in you, in all our affliction and necessitie through your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we <note>For now you cannot otherwise think of me as at rest and in a good state of being, unless you go forward in religion and faith.</note> live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thankes can wee recompense to God againe for you, for all the ioy wherewith we reioyce for your sakes before our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might <note>Paul was forced through the pressing dealing of the enemies to leave the building which he had just begun: and for that reason he had left Silas and Timothy in Macedonia, and when Timothy came to Athens to him, he sent him back again immediately. So that he desires to see the Thessalonians, that he may thoroughly perfect their faith and religion, that was as yet imperfect.</note> perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Nowe God himselfe, euen our Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ, guide our iourney vnto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>
          <note>Another part of the epistle, in which he speaks of the duties of a Christian life. And he shows that the perfection of a Christian life consists in two things, that is, in charity toward all men, and inward purity of the heart. And the accomplishment of these things is nonetheless deferred to the next coming of Christ, who will then perfect his work by the same grace with which he began it in us.</note>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>To make your hearts stable &amp; vnblameable in holines before God euen our Father, at the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ with all his Saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Furthermore <note>Various exhortations, the foundation of which is this, to be mindful of those things which they have heard from the apostle.</note> then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would <note>That you labour to excel more and more, and daily surpass yourselves.</note> abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye knowe what commaundements we gaue you by the Lord Iesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>
          <note>This is the sum of those things which he delivered to them, to dedicate themselves wholly to God. And he plainly condemns all filthiness through lust, because it is altogether contrary to the will of God.</note>For this is the will of God, [even] your <note>See (Joh_17:17).</note> sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>
          <note>Another reason, because it defiles the body.</note>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>
          <note>The third, because the saints are distinguished by honesty and purity from those who do not know God.</note>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>
          <note>Secondly, he reprehends all violent oppression, and immoderate desire, and shows most severely as the Prophet of God, that God will avenge such wickedness.</note>That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God hath not called vs vnto vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>He therefore that <note>These commandments which I gave you.</note> despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>
          <note>Thirdly, he requires a ready mind to every manner of lovingkindness, and exhorts them to profit more and more in that virtue.</note>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>Yea, and that thing verily yee doe vnto all the brethren, which are throughout all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>
          <note>He condemns unsettled minds, and such as are curious in matters which do not concern them.</note>And that ye study to be quiet, <note>He rebukes idleness and slothfulness: and whoever is given to these vices, fall into other wickedness, to the great offence of the Church.</note> and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That yee may behaue your selues honestly towarde them that are without, and that nothing be lacking vnto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>
          <note>The third part of the epistle, which is mixed in among the former exhortations (which he returns to afterwards), in which he speaks of mourning for the dead, and the manner of the resurrection, and of the latter day.</note>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, <note>We must take heed that we do not immoderately mourn for the dead, that is, as those do who think that the dead are utterly perished.</note> concerning them <note>A confirmation: for death is but a sleep of the body (for he speaks of the faithful) until the Lord comes.</note> which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>
          <note>A reason for the confirmation, for seeing that the head is risen, the members also will rise, and that by the power of God.</note>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in <note>The dead in Christ, who continue in faith by which they are ingrafted into Christ, even to the last breath.</note> Jesus will God <note>Will call their bodies out of their graves, and join their souls to them again.</note> bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>
          <note>The manner of the resurrection will be in this way: the bodies of the dead will be as it were raised out of sleep at the sound of the trumpet of God. Christ himself will descend from heaven. The saints (for he is referring to them) who will then be found alive, together with the dead who will rise, will be taken up into the clouds to meet the Lord, and will be in perpetual glory with him.</note>For this we say unto you by the <note>In the name of the Lord, as though he himself spoke to you.</note> word of the Lord, that <note>He speaks of these things, as though he should be one of those whom the Lord will find alive at his coming, because the time of his coming is uncertain: and therefore every one of us ought to be in such a readiness, as if the Lord were coming at any moment.</note> we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a <note>The word which the apostle uses here, properly signifies that encouragement which mariners give to one another, when they altogether with one shout put forth their oars and row together.</note> shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be <note>Suddenly and in the twinkling of an eye.</note> caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore, comfort your selues one another with these wordes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But <note>The day that God has appointed for this judgment we do not know. But this is sure, that it will come upon men when they are not expecting it.</note> of the times and the <note>See (Act_1:7).</note> seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For ye your selues knowe perfectly, that the day of the Lorde shall come, euen as a thiefe in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they shall say, Peace, and safetie, then shall come vpon them sudden destruction, as the trauaile vpon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>
          <note>Returning to exhortations, he warns us who are enlightened with the knowledge of God, that it is our duty not to live securely in pleasures, lest we be suddenly taken in a dead sleep in pleasures. But contrary to this we are to have an eye to the Lord, and not allow ourselves to be oppressed with the cares of this world, for pleasures are fitting for the darkness of the night, and having an eye to the Lord is fitting for the light.</note>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>Yee are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, neither of darkenesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let vs not sleepe as do other, but let vs watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleepe, sleepe in the night, and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>
          <note>We must fight with faith and hope, and therefore we should certainly not lie snoring.</note>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>
          <note>He urges us forward by setting a most certain hope of victory before us.</note>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>
          <note>The death of Christ is a pledge of our victory, for he died so that we might be partakers of his life of power, indeed even while we live here.</note>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>
