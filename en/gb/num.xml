        <verse osisID='Num.1.1'>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of <note>In the place in the wilderness that was near mount Sinai.</note> Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first [day] of the <note>Which is part of April and part of May.</note> second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, <note>The Argument - In that as God has appointed that his Church in this world shall be under the cross, both so they could learn not to put their trust in worldly things, and also feel his comfort, when all other help fails: he did not immediately bring his people, after their departure out of Egypt, into the land which he had promised them: but led them to and fro for the space of forty years, and kept them in continual exercises before they enjoyed it, to try their faith, teach them to forget the world, and to depend on him. Which trial greatly profited, to discern the wicked and the hypocrites from the faithful and true servants of God, who served him with pure heart, while the other, preferring their earthly lusts to God's glory, and making religion to serve their purpose, complained when they lacked enough to satisfy their lusts, and despised those who God had appointed as rulers over them. By reason of which they provoked God's terrible judgments against them, and are set forth as a notable example for all ages, to beware how they abuse God's word, prefer their own lusts to his will, or despise his ministers. Nonetheless, God is always true to his promise, and governs his by his Holy Spirit, that either they fall not to such inconveniences, or else return to him quickly in true repentance: and therefore he continues his graces toward them, he gives them ordinances and instructions, as well for religion, as outward policy: he preserves them against all deceit and conspiracy, and gives them many victories against their enemies. To avoid all controversies that might arise, he takes away the occasions, by dividing among all the tribes, both the land which they had won, and that also which he had promised, as seemed best to his godly wisdom.</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.34.3'>And your Southquarter shalbe from the wildernesse of Zin to the borders of Edom: so that your Southquarter shall be from the salt Sea coast Eastwarde:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.34.4'>And the border shall compasse you from the South to Maaleh-akrabbim, and reach to Zin, and goe out from the South to Kadesh-barnea: thence it shal stretch to Hazar-addar, &amp; go along to Azmon.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Num.35'>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.1'>And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaine of Moab by Iorden, toward Iericho, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.2'>Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the <note>Because they had no inheritance assigned them in the land of Canaan.</note> Levites of the inheritance of their possession <note>God would have them scattered through all the land, because the people might be preserved by them in the obedience of God and his Law.</note> cities to dwell in; and ye shall give [also] unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.3'>So they shall haue the cities to dwell in, &amp; their suburbes shall be for their cattell, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.4'>And the suburbes of the cities, which ye shal giue vnto the Leuites, from the wall of the citie outward, shalbe a thousand cubites round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.5'>And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side <note>So that in all were three thousand, and in the compass of these two thousand, they might plant and sow.</note> two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city [shall be] in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.6'>And of the cities which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites, there shalbe sixe cities for refuge, which ye shal appoint, that he which killeth, may flee thither: and to them yee shall adde two and fourtie cities mo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.7'>All the cities which yee shall giue to the Leuites, shalbe eight and fourtie cities: them shal ye giue with their suburbes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.8'>And concerning the cities which yee shall giue, of the possession of the children of Israel: of many ye shall take mo, and of few ye shall take lesse: euery one shall giue of his cities vnto the Leuites, according to his inheritance, which hee inheriteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.9'>And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.10'>Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come ouer Iorden into the land of Canaan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.11'>Ye shall appoint you cities, to bee cities of refuge for you, that the slayer, which slayeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.12'>And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the <note>Meaning, from the next of the kindred, who ought to pursue the cause.</note> avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.13'>And of the cities which ye shall giue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.14'>Ye shall give three cities <note>Among the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, (Deu_4:41).</note> on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, [which] shall be cities of refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.15'>These six cities shalbe a refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that dwelleth among you, that euery one which killeth any person vnwares, may flee thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.16'>And if he <note>Wittingly, and willingly.</note> smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.17'>And if he smite him with throwing a <note>That is, with a big and dangerous stone: in Hebrew, with a stone of his hand.</note> stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he [is] a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.18'>Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may be slaine, if he die, he is a murtherer, and the murtherer shall die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.19'>The reuenger of the blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.23'>Or any stone (whereby he might be slaine) and sawe him not, or caused it to fall vpon him, and he die, and was not his enemie, neither sought him any harme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.24'>Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the <note>That is, his next kinsman.</note> revenger of blood according to these judgments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.25'>And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the <note>Under this figure is declared, that our sins could not be remitted, but by the death of the high Priest Jesus Christ.</note> high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.35.30'>Whosoeuer killeth any person, the Iudge shall slay the murtherer, through witnesses: but one witnesse shall not testifie against a person to cause him to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.31'>Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which [is] <note>Who purposely committed murder.</note> guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.32'>Also ye shall take no recompense for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that he should come againe, and dwell in the lande, before the death of the hie Priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.33'>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye [are]: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be <note>So God is mindful of the blood wrongfully shed, that he makes his dumb creatures demand vengeance of it.</note> cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.35.34'>Defile not therefore the lande which yee shall inhabite, For I dwell in the middes thereof: for I the Lord dwel among the children of Israel.</verse>
