      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel <note>By the judgment of Urim; Read (Exo_28:30; Num_27:21; 1Sa_28:6)</note> asked the LORD, saying, <note>Who shall be our captain?</note> Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And the Lord said, Iudah shall goe vp: behold, I haue giuen the land into his hande.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said unto Simeon his <note>For the tribe of Simeon had their inheritance within the tribe of Judah, (Jos_19:1).</note> brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>Then Iudah went vp, and the Lorde deliuered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands, and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they founde Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and slewe the Canaanites, and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and <note>This was God's just judgment, as the tyrant himself confesses, that as he had done, so did he receive, (Lev_24:19-20).</note> cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-bezek said, Seuentie Kings hauing the thumbes of their hands &amp; of their feete cut off, gathered bread vnder my table: as I haue done, so God hath rewarded me. so they brought him to Ierusalem, and there he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the <note>Which was later built again, and possessed by the Jebusites, (2Sa_5:6).</note> city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>Afterwarde also the children of Iudah went downe to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountaine, and towarde the South, and in the lowe countrey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before [was] Kirjatharba:) and they slew <note>These three were giants, and the children of Anak.</note> Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from thence hee went to the inhabitantes of Debir, and the name of Debir in olde time was Kiriath-sepher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb saide, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, euen to him wil I giue Achsah my daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother tooke it, to whome hee gaue Achsah his daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: <note>Read (Jos_15:18).</note> and she lighted from off [her] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And shee answered him, Giue mee a blessing: for thou hast giuen me a South countrey, giue me also springs of water: and Caleb gaue her the springs aboue and the springs beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the children of the <note>This was one of the names of Moses father in law, read (Num_10:29).</note> Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which [lieth] in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>But Iudah went with Simeon his brother, and they slewe the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and vtterly destroied it, and called the name of the citie Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took <note>These cities and others were later possessed by the Philistines, (1Sa_6:17).</note> Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the Lord was with Iudah, and he possessed the mountaines: for he could not driue out the inhabitantes of the valleis, because they had charrets of yron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb, as Moses had saide, and hee expelled thence the three sonnes of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that <note>For after the tribe of Judah had burnt it, they built it again.</note> inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>They also that were of the house of Ioseph, went vp to Beth-el, and the Lord was with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Ioseph caused to viewe Beth-el (and the name of the citie beforetime was Luz)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies sawe a man come out of the citie, and they saide vnto him, Shewe vs, we praie thee, the way into the citie, and we will shewe thee mercie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And when hee had shewed them the waie into the citie, they smote the citie with the edge of the sworde, but they let the man and all his housholde depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>Then the man went into the lande of the Hittites, and built a citie, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof vnto this daie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: <note>Wherefore God permitted the Canaanites to still dwell in the land, read (Jdg_3:5).</note> but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>Neuerthelesse when Israel was strong, they put the Canaanites to tribute, and expelled them not wholly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>Likewise Ephraim expelled not the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Neither did <note>That is, the tribe of Zebulun as is also to be understood of the rest.</note> Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Neither did Asher cast out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them <note>But made them pay tribute as the others did.</note> out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Neither did Naphtali driue out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the lande: neuerthelesse the inhabitantes of Beth-shemesh, and of Beth-anath became tributaries vnto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites droue the children of Dan into the mountaine: so that they suffered them not to come downe to the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the <note>Meaning, when he was stronger than they.</note> hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the coast of the Amorites [was] from the going up to Akrabbim, from the <note>Or Selah, which was a city in Arabia.</note> rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And an <note>That is, messenger, or prophet, as some think, Phinehas.</note> angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>Ye also shall make no couenant with the inhabitants of this land, but shall breake downe their altars: but ye haue not obeyed my voyce. Why haue ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Wherefore, I sayd also, I wil not cast them out before you, but they shalbe as thornes vnto your sides, &amp; their gods shalbe your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And when the Angel of the Lorde spake these wordes vnto all the children of Israel, the people lift vp their voyce, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>Therefore they called the name of that place, Bochim, and offered sacrifices there vnto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>And when Joshua had <note>After that he had divided to every man his portion by lot, (Jos_24:28).</note> let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great <note>Meaning, the wonders and miracles.</note> works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>But Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of the Lord dyed, when he was an hundreth and ten yeeres olde:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in <note>Heres, by turning the letters backward is Sereh, as in (Jos_24:30).</note> Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And so all that generation was gathered vnto their fathers, &amp; another generation arose after them, which neither knewe the Lord, nor yet the works, which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served <note>That is, all manner of idols.</note> Baalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And forsooke ye Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the lande of Egypt, &amp; followed other gods, euen the gods of the people that were round about them, &amp; bowed vnto them, and prouoked the Lord to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and <note>These were idols, which had the form of a ewe or sheep among the Sidonians.</note> Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the wrath of the Lorde was hote against Israel, &amp; he deliuered them into the hands of spoylers, that spoyled them, and he sold them into the handes of their enemies rounde about them, so that they could no longer stande before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>
          <note>In all their enterprises.</note>Whithersoever they went out, the <note>The vengeance.</note> hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Notwithstanding, the Lorde raysed vp Iudges, which deliuered them out of the hands of their oppressours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the <note>Meaning, from the true religion.</note> way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; [but] they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings <note>Seeing their cruelty.</note> by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>Yet when the Iudge was dead, they returned, and did worse then their fathers, in following other gods to serue them and worshippe them: they ceased not from their owne inuentions, nor from their rebellious way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>Wherfore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sayd, Because this people hath transgressed my couenant, which I commaded their fathers, &amp; hath not obeyed my voyce,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the <note>As the Hivites, Jebusites, Amorites, etc.</note> nations which Joshua left when he died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>That through them I may <note>So that both outward enemies and false prophets are but a trial to prove our faith, (Deu_13:3; Jdg_3:1).</note> prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep [it], or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>So the Lorde left those nations, and droue them not out immediately, neither deliuered them into the hand of Ioshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the <note>Which were achieved by the hand of God, and not by the power of man.</note> wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew <note>For they trusted in God and he fought for them.</note> nothing thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>Fiue princes of the Philistims, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, &amp; the Hiuites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon vntill one come to Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And these remayned to proue Israel by them, to wit, whether they would obey the commandements of the Lorde, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, &amp; the Amorites, and the Perizzites, &amp; the Hiuites, and the Iebusites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took <note>Contrary to God's commandment, (Deu_7:3).</note> their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the <note>Or Ashteroth, trees or woods erected for idolatry.</note> groves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the wrath of the Lorde was kindled against Israel, and he solde them into the hand of Chushan rishathaim King of Aram-naharaim, and the children of Israel serued Chushan rishathaim eyght yeeres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lorde, the Lord stirred vp a sauiour to ye children of Israel, &amp; he saued them, euen Othniel the sonne of Kenaz, Calebs yonger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the <note>He was stirred up by the Spirit of the Lord.</note> Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest <note>That is, 32 under Joshua and 8 under Othniel.</note> forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD <note>So that the enemies of God's people have no power over them, but by God's appointment.</note> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered vnto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, &amp; went and smote Israel, and they possessed the citie of palme trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the children of Israel serued Eglon king of Moab eighteene yeeres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the children of Israel cried vnto the Lorde, the Lorde stirred them vp a sauiour, Ehud the sonne of Gera the sonne of Iemini, a man lame of his right hande: and the children of Israel sent a present by him vnto Eglon King of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>And Ehud made him a dagger with two edges of a cubite length, and he did gird it vnder his rayment vpon his right thigh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he presented ye gift vnto Eglon King of Moab (and Eglon was a very fat man)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had now presented the present, he sent away the people that bare ye present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned again from the <note>Or, as some read from the places of idols.</note> quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep <note>Till all be departed.</note> silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>Then Ehud came vnto him. (and he sate alone in a sommer parler, which he had) and Ehud said, I haue a message vnto thee from God. Then he arose out of his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, &amp; tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his bellie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>So that the hafte went in after the blade, and the fatte closed about the blade, so that he could not drawe the dagger out of his bellie, but the dirt came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud gate him out into the porch, and shut the doores of the parler vpon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>And when he was gone out, his seruantes came: who seeing that the doores of the parler were locked, they sayd, Surely he doeth his easement in his sommer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they taryed till they were ashamed: &amp; seeing he opened not the doores of the parler, they tooke the key, and opened them, &amp; behold, their lord was fallen dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>So Ehud escaped (while they taried) &amp; was passed the quarris, and escaped vnto Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And when he came home, he blew a trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mountaine, and he went before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>Then said he vnto them, Follow me: for the Lorde hath deliuered your enemies, euen Moab into your hand. So they went downe after him, &amp; tooke the passages of Iorden towarde Moab, and suffred not a man to passe ouer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they slewe of the Moabites the same time about ten thousand men, all fed men, &amp; all were warriours, and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the <note>Meaning, the Israelites.</note> land had rest fourscore years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox <note>So that it is not the number, nor the means that God regards, when he will get the victory.</note> goad: and he also delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the children of Israel began againe to do wickedly in the sight of the Lorde when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of <note>There was another Jabin, whom Joshua killed and burnt his city Hazor, (Jos_11:13).</note> Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host [was] Sisera, which dwelt in <note>That is in a wood, or strong place,</note> Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>Then the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lord: (for he had nine hundreth charets of yron, and twentie yeeres he had vexed the children of Israel very sore)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she <note>By the spirit of prophesy resolving controversies and declaring the will of God.</note> judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And this Deborah dwelt vnder a palme tree, betweene Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came vp to her for iudgement.</verse>
