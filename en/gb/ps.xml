      <chapter osisID='Ps.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed [is] the man that walketh not in the <note>When a man has once given place to evil counsel, or to his own sin nature, he begins to forget himself in his sin, and so falls into contempt of God, which is called the seat of the scorners.</note> counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. <note>The Argument - This book of psalms is given to us by the Holy Spirit, to be esteemed as a precious treasure in which all things are contained that bring to true happiness in this present life as well as in the life to come. For the riches of true knowledge and heavenly wisdom, are here set open for us, to take of it most abundantly. If we would know the great and high majesty of God, here we may see the brightness of it shine clearly. If we would seek his incomprehensible wisdom, here is the school of the same profession. If we would comprehend his inestimable bounty, and approach near to it, and fill our hands with that treasure, here we may have a most lively and comfortable taste of it. If we would know where our salvation lies and how to attain to everlasting life, here is Christ our Redeemer, and Mediator most evidently described. The rich man may learn the true use of his riches. The poor man may find full contentment. He who will rejoice will know true joy, and how to keep measure in it. They who are afflicted and oppressed will see what their comfort exists in, and how they should praise God when he sends them deliverance. The wicked and the persecutors of the children of God will see how the hand of God is always against them: and though he permits them to prosper for a while, yet he bridles them, so much so that they cannot touch a hair of ones head unless he permits them, and how in the end their destruction is most miserable. Briefly here we have most present remedies against all temptations and troubles of mind and conscience, so that being well practised in this, we may be assured against all dangers in this life, live in the true fear and love of God, and at length attain the incorruptible crown of glory, which is laid up for all who love the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight [is] in the law of the LORD; and in his <note>In the holy scriptures.</note> law doth he meditate day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and <note>God's children are so moistened with his grace, that whatever comes to them, tends to their salvation.</note> whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>
          <note>Though the wicked seem to prosper in this world, yet the Lord drives them down that they shall not rise nor stand in the company of the righteous.</note>The ungodly [are] not so: but [are] like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the <note>But tremble when they see God's wrath.</note> judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For the LORD <note>Approves and prospers, in the same way that to not know is to reprove and reject.</note> knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>
          <note>Thus the wicked say that they will cast off the yoke of God and of his Christ.</note>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>But he that dwelleth in the heauen, shall laugh: the Lord shall haue them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>
          <note>God's plagues will declare that in resisting his Christ, they fought against him.</note>Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Euen I haue set my King vpon Zion mine holy mountaine.</verse>

So it is applied to Christ in his first coming and manifestation to the world.</note> day have I begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the <note>Not only the Jews but the Gentiles also.</note> uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>Thou shalt krush them with a scepter of yron, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>
          <note>He exhorts all rulers to repent in time.</note>Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serue the Lorde in feare, and reioyce in trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>
          <note>In a sign of homage.</note>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye <note>When the wicked will say, Peace and rest, then will destruction suddenly come, (1Th_5:3).</note> perish [from] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
