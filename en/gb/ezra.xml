      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the <note>After he and Darius had won Babylon.</note> first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the <note>Who promised deliverance to them after 70 years were past, (Jer_25:12).</note> mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the <note>That is, moved him and gave him heart.</note> spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying, <note>The Argument - As the Lord is always merciful to his Church, and does not punish them, but so that they should see their own miseries, and be exercised under the cross, that they might contemn the world, and aspire to the heavens: so after he had visited the Jews, and kept them in bondage 70 years in a strange country among infidels and idolaters, he remembered his tender mercies and their infirmities, and therefore for his own sake raised up a deliverer, and moved both the heart of the chief ruler to pity them, and also by him punished those who had kept them in slavery. Nonetheless, lest they should grow into a contempt of God's great benefits, he keeps them still in exercise, and raises domestic enemies, who try as much as they can to hinder their worthy enterprises: yet by the exhortation of the prophet they went forward little by little till their work was finished. The author of this book was Ezra, who was a priest and scribe of the Law, as in (Ezr_7:6). He returned to Jerusalem the sixth year of Darius, who succeeded Cyrus, that is, about fifty years after the first return under Zerubbabel, when the temple was built. He brought with him a great company and much treasure, with letters to the king's officers for all things needed for the temple: and at his coming he fixed that which was amiss, and set things in order.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me <note>For he was chief monarch and had many nations under his dominion, which this heathen king confesses to have received from the living God.</note> all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Who is he among you of all his people with whome his God is? let him goe vp to Ierusalem which is in Iudah, and buylde the house of the Lorde God of Israel: he is the God, which is in Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, <note>If any through poverty were not able to return, the king's commission was that he should be furnished with all he needed.</note> let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, <note>Which they themselves should send for the repairing of the temple.</note> beside the freewill offering for the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then the chiefe fathers of Iudah &amp; Beniamin, &amp; the Priests &amp; Leuites rose vp, with al them whose spirit God had raysed to goe vp, to builde the house of the Lord which is in Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all <note>The Babylonians and Chaldeans gave them these presents: thus rather than have the children of God be in need, he would stir the heart of the infidels to help them.</note> they that [were] about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all [that] was willingly offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also the King Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of Ierusalem, and had put them in the house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto <note>So the Chaldeans called Zerubbabel who was the chief governor, so that the preeminence still remained in the house of David.</note> Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this [is] the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty <note>Which served to kill the beasts that were offered in sacrifice.</note> knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>Thirtie boules of gold, and of siluer boules of the second sort, foure hundreth and tenne, and of other vessels, a thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>All the vessels of gold and of silver [were] five thousand and four hundred. All [these] did Sheshbazzar bring up <note>With the Jews who had been kept captive in Babylon.</note> with [them of] the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>Thus they sang when they gaue prayse, and when they gaue thankes vnto the Lorde, For he is good, for his mercie endureth for euer toward Israel; all the people shouted with a great shoute, when they praysed the Lorde, because the foundation of the house of the Lorde was layed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, [who were] ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, <note>Because they saw that it was not nearly as glorious as the temple Solomon had built, nonetheless Aggeus comforted them and prophesied that it would be more beautiful than the first, meaning the spiritual temple, they who are the members of Christ's body.</note> wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people coulde not discerne the sound of the shoute for ioy, from the noyse of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loude crie, &amp; the noyse was heard farre off.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>And they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefe fathers, and sayd vnto them, We wil builde with you: for we seeke the Lord your God as ye do, and we haue sacrificed vnto him since the time of Esar Haddon king of Asshur, which brought vs vp hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; <note>For they knew their pretence, that is to erect idolatry instead of true religion.</note> but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Wherefore the people of the land discouraged the people of Iudah, and troubled them in buylding,</verse>
