      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, <note>The inscription of the epistle, in which he mainly tries to procure the good will of the Corinthians towards him, yet nonetheless in such a way that he always lets them know that he is the servant of God and not of men.</note> called [to be] an <note>If he is an apostle, then he must be heard, even though he sometimes sharply reprehends them, seeing he has not his own cause in hand, but is a messenger that brings the commandments of Christ.</note> apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and <note>He has Sosthenes with himself, that this doctrine might be confirmed by two witnesses.</note> Sosthenes [our] brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>
          <note>It is a church of God, even though it has great faults in it, as it obeys those who admonish them.</note>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are <note>A true definition of the universal church, which is:</note> sanctified in <note>The Father sanctifies us, that is to say, separates us from the wicked in giving us to his Son, that he may be in us, and we in him.</note> Christ Jesus, <note>Whom God by his gracious goodness and absolute love has separated for himself: or whom God has called to holiness: the first of these two expositions, shows from where our sanctification comes: and the second shows to what end it strives for.</note> called [to be] saints, with all that in every place <note>He is correctly said to call on God who cries to the Lord when he is in danger, and craves help from his hands, and by the figure of speech synecdoche, it is taken for all the service of God: and therefore to call upon Christ's name, is to acknowledge and take him for very God.</note> call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>
          <note>The foundation and the life of the Church is Christ Jesus given from the Father.</note>Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>
          <note>Going about to condemn many vices, he begins with a true commendation of their virtues, lest he might seem after to descend to chiding, being moved with malice or envy: yet in such a way that he refers all to God as the author of them, and that in Christ, that the Corinthians might be more ashamed to profane and abuse the holy gifts of God.</note>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, <note>He refers to that by name which they abused the most.</note> in <note>Seeing that while we live here we know but in part, and prophesy in part, this word «all» must be limited by the present state of the faithful: and by «utterance» he does not mean a vain kind of babbling, but the gift of holy eloquence, which the Corinthians abused.</note> all utterance, and [in] all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>
          <note>He shows that the true use of these gifts consists in this, that the mighty power of Christ might be set forth in them, that hereafter it might evidently appear how wickedly they abused them for glory and ambition.</note>Even as the testimony of Christ was <note>By those excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit.</note> confirmed in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>So that ye come behind in no gift; <note>He says along the way that there is no reason why they should be so pleased in those gifts which they had received, seeing that those were nothing in comparison of those which are to be looked for.</note> waiting for the <note>He speaks of the last coming of Christ.</note> coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>
          <note>He testifies that he hopes that things go well with them from now on, that they may more patiently abide his reprehension afterward. And yet together in addition shows, that the beginning as well as the accomplishing of our salvation is only the work of God.</note>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, [that ye may be] <note>He calls them blameless, not whom man never found fault with, but with whom no man can justly find fault, that is to say, those who are in Christ Jesus, in whom there is no condemnation. See (Luk_1:6).</note> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God [is] <note>True and constant, who not only calls us, but also gives to us the gift of perseverance.</note> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>
          <note>Having made an end of the preface, he comes to the matter itself, beginning with a most grave testimony, as though they should hear Christ himself speaking, and not Paul.</note>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that <note>The first part of this epistle, in which his purpose is found, to call back the Corinthians to brotherly harmony, and to take away all occasion of discord. So then this first part concerns the taking away of divisions. Now a division occurs when men who otherwise agree and consent together in doctrine, yet separate themselves from one another.</note> ye all speak the same thing, and [that] there be no divisions among you; but [that] ye be <note>Knit together, as a body that consists of all its parts, fitly knit together.</note> perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>
          <note>He begins his reprehension and chiding by taking away an objection, because he understood from good witnesses that there were many factions among them. And in addition he declares the cause of dissentions, because some depended on one teacher, some on another, and some were so addicted to themselves that they neglected all teachers and learned men, calling themselves the disciples of Christ alone, completely ignoring their teachers.</note>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them [which are of the house] of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now <note>The matter I would say to you is this.</note> this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>
          <note>The first reason why divisions ought to be avoided: because Christ seems by that means to be divide and torn in pieces, who cannot be the head of two different and disagreeing bodies, being himself one.</note>Is Christ divided? was <note>Another reason: because they cannot without great injury to God so depend on men as on Christ: which thing those no doubt do who allow whatever some man speaks, and do it for their own sakes: as these men allowed one and the very same Gospel being uttered by one man, and did loathe it being uttered by another man. So that these factions were called by the names of their teachers. Now Paul sets aside his own name, not simply to grieve no man, but also to show that he does not plead his own cause.</note> Paul crucified for you? or were ye <note>The third reason taken from the form and end of baptism, in which we make a promise to Christ, calling also on the name of the Father, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore although a man does not fall from the doctrine of Christ, yet if he depends upon certain teachers, and despises others, he forsakes Christ: for if he holds Christ as his only master, he would hear him, no matter who Christ taught by.</note> baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>
          <note>He protests that he speaks so much the more boldly of these things, because through God's providence, he is void of all suspicion of gathering disciples to himself, and taking them from others. By which we may understand, that not the scholars only, but the teachers also are here reprehended, who gathered flocks separately and for themselves.</note>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>Lest any should say, that I had baptized into mine owne name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I baptized also the houshold of Stephanas: furthermore knowe I not, whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>
          <note>The taking away of an objection: that he gave not himself to baptize many amongst them: not for the contempt of baptism, but because he was mainly occupied in delivering the doctrine, and committed those that received his doctrine to others to be baptized. And so he declared sufficiently how far he was from all ambition: whereas on the other hand they, whom he reprehends, as though they gathered disciples to themselves and not to Christ, bragged most ambitiously of numbers, which they had baptized.</note>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: <note>Now he turns himself to the teachers themselves, who pleased themselves in brave and glory-seeking eloquence, to the end that they might draw more disciples after them. He openly confesses that he was not similar to them, opposing gravely, as it became an apostle, his example against their perverse judgments: so that this is another place in this epistle with regard to the observing of a godly simplicity both in words and sentences in teaching the Gospel.</note> not with <note>With eloquence: which Paul casts off from himself not only as unnecessary, but also as completely contrary to the office of his apostleship: and yet Paul had this kind of eloquence, but it was heavenly, not of man, and void of fancy words.</note> wisdom of words, lest the <note>The reason why he did not use the pomp of words and fancy speech: because it was God's will to bring the world to his obedience by that way, by which the most foolish among men might understand that this work was done by God himself, without the skill of man. Therefore as salvation is set forth to us in the Gospel by the cross of Christ, which nothing is more contemptible than, and more far from life, so God would have the manner of the preaching of the cross, most different from those means with which men do use to draw and entice others, either to hear or believe: therefore it pleased him by a certain kind of most wise folly, to triumph over the most foolish wisdom of the world, as he had said before by Isaiah that he would. And by this we may gather that both these teachers who were puffed up with ambitious eloquence, and also their hearers, strayed far away from the goal and mark of their calling.</note> cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the <note>The preaching of Christ crucified, or the type of speech which we use.</note> preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the <note>It is that in which he declares his marvellous power in saving his elect, which would not so evidently appear if it depended upon any help of man, for if it did man might attribute that to himself which is to be attributed only to the cross of Christ.</note> power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>
          <note>The apostle proves that this should not seem strange, seeing that it was foretold so long before, and declares further that God often punishes the pride of the world in such a way, which so pleases itself in its own wisdom: and therefore that it is vain, indeed a thing of no value, and such as God rejects as unprofitable, which they so carefully laboured for, and considered to be so important.</note>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where [is] the wise? where [is] the <note>Where are you, O you learned fellow, and you that spend your days in turning your books?</note> scribe? where [is] the <note>You that spend all your time in seeking out the secret things of this world, and in expounding all hard questions: and thus he triumphs against all the men of this world, for there was not one of them that could so much as dream of this secret and hidden mystery.</note> disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>
          <note>He shows that the pride of men was worthily punished by God, because they could not behold God, as they properly should have, in the most clear mirror of the wisdom of the world, and this wisdom is the workmanship of the world.</note>For after that in the <note>By the world he means all men who are not born again, but remain as they were, when they were first born.</note> wisdom of God the <note>In the workmanship of this world, which has the marvellous wisdom of God engraved on it, so that every man may behold it.</note> world by wisdom knew not God, <note>The goodness of God is wonderful, for while he goes about to punish the pride of this world, he is very provident and careful for the salvation of it, and teaches men to become fools, so that they may be wise to God.</note> it pleased God by the <note>So he calls the preaching of the Gospel, as the enemies supposed it to be: but in the mean time he taunts those very sharply who had rather charge God with folly than acknowledge their own, and crave pardon for it.</note> foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>
          <note>A declaration of that which he said: that the preaching of the Gospel is foolish. It is foolish, he says, to those whom God has not endued with new light, that is to say, to all men being considered in themselves: for the Jews require miracles, and the Greeks arguments, which they may comprehend by their intellect and wisdom: and therefore they do not believe the Gospel, and also mock it. Nonetheless, in this foolish preaching there is the great power and wisdom of God, but such that only those who are called perceive: God showing most plainly, that even then when mad men think him most foolish, he is far wiser than they are, and that he surmounts all their might and power, when he uses most vile and abject things, as it has appeared in the fruit of the preaching of the Gospel.</note>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>But wee preach Christ crucified: vnto the Iewes, euen a stumbling blocke, and vnto the Grecians, foolishnesse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But vnto them which are called, both of the Iewes and Grecians, we preach Christ, the power of God, and the wisedome of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishnesse of God is wiser then men, and the weakenesse of God is stronger then men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>
          <note>A confirmation taken from those things which came to pass at Corinth, where the church especially consisted of the lowly and common people, insomuch that the philosophers of Greece were driven to shame when they saw that they could do nothing with their wisdom and eloquence in comparison with the apostles, whom nonetheless they called idiots and unlearned. And in this he beats down their pride: for God did not prefer them before those noble and wise men so that they should be proud, but that they might be constrained, whether they wished to or not, to rejoice in the Lord, by whose mercy, although they were the most abject of all, they had obtained in Christ both this wisdom as well as all things necessary to salvation.</note>For ye see your <note>What way the Lord has taken in calling you.</note> calling, brethren, how that not many wise men <note>After that type of wisdom which men consider to be important, as though there were none else: but because they are carnal, they do not know spiritual wisdom.</note> after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God hath chosen the foolish thinges of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weake thinges of the worlde, to confound the mightie things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, [yea], and things which <note>Which in man's judgment are almost nothing.</note> are not, to bring to <note>To show that they are vain and unprofitable, and worth nothing. {{See Rom_3:31}}</note> nought things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>That no <note>«Flesh» is often, as we see, taken for the whole man: and he uses this word «flesh» very well, to contrast the weak and miserable condition of man with the majesty of God.</note> flesh should glory in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But <note>Whom he cast down before, now he lifts up, indeed, higher than all men: yet in such a way that he shows them that all their worthiness is outside of themselves, that is, it stands in Christ, and that of God.</note> of him are ye in Christ Jesus, <note>He teaches that especially and above all things, the Gospel ought not to be condemned, seeing that it contains the principal things that are to be desired, that is, true wisdom, the true way to obtain righteousness, the true way to live honestly and godly, and the true deliverance from all miseries and calamities.</note> who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>That, according as it is written, <note>Let him yield all to God and give him thanks: and so by this place is man's free will beaten down, which the papists so dream about.</note> He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And <note>He returns to (1Co_1:17), that is to say, to his own example: confessing that he did not use among them either excellency of words or enticing speech of man's wisdom, but with great simplicity of speech both knew and preached Jesus Christ crucified, humbled and abject, with regard to the flesh.</note> I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the <note>The Gospel.</note> testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I <note>I did not profess any knowledge but the knowledge of Christ and him crucified.</note> determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in <note>He contrasts weakness with excellency of words, and therefore joins with it fear and trembling, which are companions of true modesty, not such fear and trembling as terrify the conscience, but such as are contrary to vanity and pride.</note> weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching [was] not with enticing words of man's wisdom, <note>He turns now to the commendation of his ministry, which he had granted to his adversaries: for his strength and power, which they knew well enough, was so much the more excellent because it had no worldly help behind it.</note> but in <note>By «demonstration» he means such a proof as is made by reasons both certain and necessary.</note> demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>
          <note>And he tells the Corinthians that he did it for their great profit, because they might by this know manifestly that the Gospel was from heaven. Therefore he privately rebukes them, because in vainly seeking to be noticed, they willingly deprived themselves of the greatest help of their faith.</note>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>
          <note>Another argument taken from the nature of the thing, that is, of the Gospel, which is true wisdom, but known only to those who are desirous of perfection: and it is unsavoury to those who otherwise excel in the world, but yet vainly and frailly.</note>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are <note>They are called perfect here, not who had already gotten perfection, but those who are striving for it, as in (Phi_3:15): so that perfect is contrasted with weak.</note> perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the <note>Those that are wiser, richer, or mightier than other men are.</note> princes of this world, that come to nought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>
          <note>He shows the reason why this wisdom cannot be perceived by those excellent worldly intellects: that is, because it is indeed so deep that they cannot attain to it.</note>But we speak the wisdom of God in a <note>Which men could not so much as dream of.</note> mystery, [even] the hidden [wisdom], <note>He takes away an objection: if it is so hard, when and how is it known? God, he says, determined with himself from the beginning, that which his purpose was to bring forth at this time out of his secrets, for the salvation of men.</note> which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>
          <note>He takes away another objection: why then, how comes it to pass that this wisdom was so rejected by men of the highest authority, that they crucified Christ himself? Paul answers: because they did not know Christ such as he was.</note>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known [it], they would not have crucified the <note>That mighty God, full of true majesty and glory: now this place has in it a most evident proof of the divinity of Christ, and of the joining of the two natures in one in him, which has this in it, that which is proper to the manhood alone is confirmed of the Godhead joined with the manhood. This type of speech is called, by the old fathers, a making common of things belonging to someone with another to whom they do not belong.</note> Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>
          <note>Another objection: but how could it be that those intelligent men could not perceive this wisdom? Paul answers: because we preach those things which surpass all man's understanding.</note>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the <note>Man cannot so much as think of them, much less conceive them with his senses.</note> heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>
          <note>A question: if it surpasses the capacity of men, how can it be understood by any man, or how can you declare and preach it? By a special enlightening of God's Spirit, with which whoever is inspired, he can enter even into the very secrets of God.</note>But God hath revealed [them] unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit <note>There is nothing so secret and hidden in God, but the Spirit of God penetrates it.</note> searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>
          <note>He sets it forth in comparison, which he spoke by the inspiration of the Sprit. As the power of man's intellect searches out things pertaining to man, so does our mind by the power of the Holy Spirit understand heavenly things.</note>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the <note>The mind of man which is endued with the ability to understand and judge.</note> spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the <note>The Spirit which we have received does not teach us things of this world, but lifts us up to God, and this verse teaches us the opposite of what the papists teach: what faith is, from where it comes, and from what power it originates.</note> spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; <note>That which he spoke generally, he confines now to those things which God has opened to us of our salvation in Christ: so that no man should separate the Spirit from the preaching of the word and Christ: or should think that those fanciful men are governed by the Spirit of God, who wandering besides the word, thrust upon us their vain imaginations for the secrets of God.</note> that we might <note>This word «know» is taken here in its proper sense for true knowledge, which the Spirit of God works in us.</note> know the things that are freely given to us of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>
          <note>Now he returns to his purpose, and concludes the argument which he began in verse six (1Co_2:6), and it is this: the words must be applied to the matter, and the matter must be set forth with words which are proper and appropriate for it: now this wisdom is spiritual and not from man, and therefore it must be delivered by a spiritual type of teaching, and not by enticing words of man's eloquence, so that the simple, and yet wonderful majesty of the Holy Spirit may appear in it.</note>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; <note>Applying the words to the matter, that is, that as we teach spiritual things, so must our type of teaching be spiritual.</note> comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>
          <note>Again he anticipates an offence or stumbling block: how does it come to pass that so few allow these things? This is not to be marvelled at, the apostle says, seeing that men in their natural powers (as they call them) are not endued with that faculty by which spiritual things are discerned (which faculty comes another way) and therefore they consider spiritual wisdom as folly: and it is as if he should say, «It is no marvel that blind men cannot judge of colours, seeing that they lack the light of their eyes, and therefore light is to them as darkness.»</note>But the <note>The man that has no further light of understanding, than that which he brought with him, even from his mother's womb, as Jude defines it; (Jude 19).</note> natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are <note>By the power of the Holy Spirit.</note> spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>
          <note>He amplifies the matter by opposites.</note>But he that is spiritual <note>Understands and discerns.</note> judgeth all things, yet <note>The wisdom of the flesh, Paul says, determines nothing certainly, no not in its own affairs, much less can it discern strange, that is, spiritual things. But the Spirit of God, with which spiritual men are endued, can by no means be deceived, and therefore be reproved by any man.</note> he himself is judged of <note>Of no man: for when the prophets are judged of the prophets, it is the Spirit that judges, and not the man.</note> no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>
          <note>A reason from the former saying: for he is called spiritual, who has learned that by the power of the Spirit, which Christ has taught us. Now if that which we have learned from that Master could be reproved by any man, he must be wiser than God: whereupon it follows that they are not only foolish, but also wicked, who think that they can devise something that is either more perfect, or that they can teach the wisdom of God a better way than those knew or taught who were undoubtedly endued with God's Spirit.</note>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may <note>Lay his head to his, and teach him what he should do.</note> instruct him? But we have <note>We are endued with the Spirit of Christ, who opens to us those secrets which by all other means are unsearchable, and also any truth at all.</note> the mind of Christ.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And <note>Having declared the worthiness of heavenly wisdom, and of the Gospel, and having generally condemned the blindness of man's mind, now at length he applies it particularly to the Corinthians, calling them carnal, that is, those in whom the flesh still prevails against the Spirit. And he brings a twofold testimony of it: first, because he had proved them to be such, in so much that he dealt with them as he would with ignorant men, and those who are almost babes in the doctrine of godliness, and second, because they showed indeed by these dissensions, which sprang up by reason of the ignorance of the power of the Spirit, and heavenly wisdom, that they had profited very little or nothing.</note> I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto <note>He calls them carnal, who are as yet ignorant, and therefore to express it better, he calls them «babes».</note> carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.</verse>

The difference was only in the manner of teaching.</note> able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as <note>Using the tools of man's intellect and judgment.</note> men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one sayeth, I am Pauls, and another, I am Apollos, are yee not carnall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>
          <note>After he has sufficiently reprehended ambitious teachers, and those who foolishly esteemed them, now he shows how the true ministers are to be esteemed, that we do not attribute to them more or less than we ought to do. Therefore he teaches us that they are those by whom we are brought to faith and salvation, but yet as the ministers of God, and such as do nothing of themselves, but God so working by them as it pleases him to furnish them with his gifts. Therefore we do not have to regard or consider what minister it is that speaks, but what is spoken: and we must depend only upon him who speaks by his servants.</note>Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>
          <note>He beautifies the former sentence, with two similarities: first comparing the company of the faithful to a field which God makes fruitful, when it is sown and watered through the labour of his servants. Second, be comparing it to a house, which indeed the Lord builds, but by the hands of his workmen, some of whom he uses in laying the foundation, others in building it up. Now, both these similarities are for this purpose, to show that all things are wholly accomplished only by God's authority and might, so that we must only have an eye to him. Moreover, although God uses some in the better part of the work, we must not therefore condemn others, in respect of them, and much less may we divide or set them apart (as these factious men did) seeing that all of them labour in God's business. They work in such a way, that they serve to finish the very same work, although by a different manner of working, in so much that they all need one another's help.</note>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then, neither is hee that planteth any thing, neither hee that watreth, but God that giueth the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>And he that planteth, and he that watreth, are one, and euery man shall receiue his wages, according to his labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are <note>Serving under him: now they who serve under another do nothing by their own strength, but as it is given them of grace, which grace makes them fit for that service. See (1Co_15:10; 2Co_3:6). All the increase that comes by their labour proceeds from God in such a way that no part of the praise of it may be given to the servant.</note> labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, [ye are] God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. <note>Now he speaks to the teachers themselves, who succeeded him in the church of Corinth, and in this regard to all that were after or will be pastors of congregations, seeing that they succeed into the labour of the apostles, who were planters and chief builders. Therefore he warns them first that they do not persuade themselves that they may build after their own fantasy, that is, that they may propound and set forth anything in the Church, either in matter, or in type of teaching, different from the apostles who were the chief builders.</note> But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>
          <note>Moreover, he shows what this foundation is, that is, Christ Jesus, from whom they may not turn away in the least amount in the building up of this building.</note>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>
          <note>Thirdly he shows that they must take heed that the upper part of the building is answerable to the foundation. That is that admonitions, exhortations, and whatever pertains to the edifying of the flock, is answerable to the doctrine of Christ, in the matter as well as in form. This doctrine is compared to gold, silver, and precious stones: of which material Isaiah also and John in the Revelation build the heavenly city. And to these are the opposites, wood, hay, stubble, that is to say, curious and vain questions or decrees: and to be short, all the type of teaching which serves to vain show. For false doctrines, of which he does not speak here, are not correctly said to be built upon this foundation, unless perhaps in show only.</note>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>
          <note>He testifies, as indeed it truly is, that all are not good builders, not even all of those who stand upon this one and only foundation. However, this work of evil builders, he says, stands for a season, yet it will not always deceive, because the light of the truth appearing at length, as day, will dissolve this darkness, and show what it is. And as that stuff is tried by the fire, whether it is good or not, so will God in his time, by the touch of his Spirit and word, try all buildings, and so will it come to pass, that those which are found pure and sound, will still continue so, to the praise of the workmen. But they that are otherwise will be consumed and vanish away, and so will the workman be frustrated of the hope of his labour, who pleased himself in a thing of nothing.</note>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any mans worke, that he hath built vpon, abide, he shall receiue wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but <note>He does not take away the hope of salvation from the unskilful and foolish builders, who hold fast the foundation, of which sort were those rhetoricians, rather than the pastors of Corinth. However, he adds an exception, that they must nonetheless suffer this trial of their work, and also abide the loss of their vain labours.</note> he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>
          <note>Continuing still in the metaphor of building, he teaches us that this ambition is not only vain, but also sacrilegious: for he says that the Church is as it were the Temple of God, which God has as it were consecrated to himself by his Spirit. Then turning himself to these ambitious men, he shows that they profane the Temple of God, because those vain arts in which they please themselves so much are, as he teaches, many pollutions of the holy doctrine of God, and the purity of the Church. This wickedness will not go unpunished.</note>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man <note>Defiles it and makes it unclean, being holy: and surely they do defile it, by Paul's judgment, who by fleshly eloquence defile the purity of the Gospel.</note> defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>
          <note>He concludes by the opposite, that they profess pure wisdom in the Church of God, who refuse and cast away all those vanities of men. Further, if they are mocked by the world, it is sufficient for them that they are wise according to the wisdom of God, and as he will have them to be wise.</note>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He <note>Be they ever so crafty, yet the Lord will take them when he will discover their treachery.</note> taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And againe, The Lord knoweth that the thoughtes of the wise be vaine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>
          <note>He returns to the proposition of the second verse, first warning the hearers, that from now on they do not esteem as lords those whom God has appointed to be ministers and not lords of their salvation. This is done by those that depend upon men, and not upon God that speaks by them.</note>Therefore let no man <note>Please himself.</note> glory in men. For all things are <note>Helps, appointed for your benefit.</note> yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the <note>He passes from the persons to the things themselves, that his argument may be more forcible. Indeed, he ascends from Christ to the Father, to show that we rest ourselves not in Christ himself, in that he is man, but because he carries us up even to the Father, as Christ witnesses of himself everywhere that he was sent by his Father, that by this band we may be all united with God himself.</note> world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let <note>He concludes the duty of the hearers towards their ministers: that they do not esteem them as lords. Yet nonetheless they are to give ear to them, as to those that are sent from Christ. Sent I say to this end and purpose, that they may receive as it were at their hands the treasure of salvation which is drawn out of the secrets of God.</note> a <note>Every man.</note> man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>
          <note>Last of all, he warns the ministers that they also do not behave themselves as lords, but as faithful servants, because they must render an account of their stewardship to God.</note>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>
          <note>In reprehending others, he sets himself for an example, and anticipates an objection. Using the gravity of an apostle, he shows that he does not care for the contrary judgments that those have of him, in that they esteemed him as a vile person, because he did not set forth himself as they did. And he brings good reasons why he was not moved with the judgments which they had of him.</note>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, <note>First, because that which men judge in these cases of their own brains is not to be considered any more than when the unlearned judge of wisdom.</note> or of man's <note>Literally, «day», after the manner of Cilician speech.</note> judgment: yea, <note>Secondly, he says, how can you judge how much or how little I am to be made responsible for, seeing that I myself who know myself better than you do, and who dare profess that I have walked in my calling with a good conscience, dare not yet nonetheless claim anything to myself. Nonetheless, I know that I am not blameless: much less therefore should I flatter myself as you do.</note> I judge not mine own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the <note>I submit myself to the Lord's judgment.</note> Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>
          <note>A third reason proceeding from a conclusion, as it were, out of the former reasons. It is God's office to esteem every man according to his value, because he knows the secrets of the heart, which men for the most part are ignorant of. Therefore this judgment does not pertain to you.</note>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have <note>One could not be praised above the rest, without the others being blamed: and he mentions praise rather than lack of praise, because the beginning of this dispute was this, that they gave more to some men than was appropriate.</note> praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>
          <note>Having rejected their judgment, he sets forth himself again as a singular example of modesty, as one who concealed in this epistle those factious teacher's names, did not hesitate to put down his own name and Apollos' in their place, and took upon him as it were their shame. And this shows how far was he from preferring himself to any.</note>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn <note>By our example, who choose rather to take other men's faults upon us, than to find fault with any by name.</note> in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>
          <note>He shows a good way to bridle pride. First, if you consider how it is wrong for you to exclude yourself from the number of others, seeing you are a man yourself. Second, if you consider that even though you have something more than other men have, yet you only have it by God's bountifulness. And what wise man is he that will brag of another's goodness, and that against God?</note>For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if <note>There is nothing then in us by nature that is worthy of commendation: but all that we have, we have it of grace, which the Pelegians and semi-Pelegians will not confess.</note> thou hadst not received [it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>
          <note>He descends to a most grave mockery, to cause those glory-seeking men to blush, even though they did not want to.</note>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a <note>He that thinks that Paul and the pope are alike, who lyingly boasts that he is his successor, let him compare the delicacies of the popish court with Paul's state as we see it here.</note> spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fooles for Christes sake, and ye are wise in Christ: we are weake, and ye are strong: ye are honourable, and we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Vnto this houre we both hunger, &amp; thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and haue no certaine dwelling place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And labour, working with our owne handes: we are reuiled, and yet we blesse: we are persecuted, and suffer it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>
          <note>Moderating the sharpness of his mockery, he puts them in mind to remember of whom they were begotten in Christ, and that they should not doubt to follow him for an example. Even though he seems vile according to the outward show in respect of others, yet he is mighty by the efficacy of God's Spirit, as had been shown among themselves.</note>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though ye haue tenne thousand instructours in Christ, yet haue ye not many fathers: for in Christ Iesus I haue begotten you through the Gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>
          <note>Last of all he descends also to apostolic threatenings, but yet chiding them as a father, lest by their disorder he was forced to come to punish some among them.</note>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the <note>By words, he means their fancy and elaborate type of eloquence, which he contrasts with the power of the Holy Spirit.</note> speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</verse>

          <note>By alluding to the ceremony of the passover, he exhorts them to cast out that unclean person from among them. In times past, he says, it was not lawful for those who celebrated the passover to eat unleavened bread, insomuch that he was held as unclean and unworthy to eat the passover, whoever had but tasted of leaven. Now our whole life must be as it were the feast of unleavened bread, in which all they that are partakers of that immaculate lamb which is slain, must cast out both of themselves, and also out of their houses and congregations, all impurity.</note>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new <note>By lump he means the whole body of the Church, every member of which must be unleavened bread, that is, be renewed in spirit, by plucking away the old corruption.</note> lump, as ye are unleavened.

          <note>Now he speaks more generally: and that which he spoke before of the incestuous person he shows that it pertains to others, who are known to be wicked and those who through their wicked life are a slander to the Church, who ought also by lawful order be cast out of the community of the Church. And making mention of eating meals, either he means that feast of love at which the supper of the Lord was received, or else their common usage and manner of life. And this is to be properly understood, lest any man should think that either matrimony was broken by excommunication, or such duties hindered and cut off by it, as we owe one to another: children to their parents, subjects to their rulers, servants to their masters, and neighbour to neighbour, to win one another to God.</note>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</verse>

          <note>The conclusion, in which he prescribes a remedy for this wrong: that is, if they end their private affairs between themselves by chosen arbiters out of the Church: for which matter and purpose, the least of you, he says, is sufficient. Therefore he does not condemn judgment seats, but shows what is expedient for the circumstance of the time, and that without any diminishing of the right of the magistrate. For he does not speak of judgments, which are practised between the faithful and the infidels, neither of public judgments, but of controversies which may be ended by private arbiters.</note>If then ye have <note>Courts and places of judgments.</note> judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are <note>Even the most abject among you.</note> least esteemed in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>
          <note>He applies the general proposition to a particular, always calling them back to this, to take away from them the false opinion of their own excellency from where all these evils sprang.</note>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But a brother goeth to law with a brother, and that vnder the infidels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>
          <note>Now he goes further also, and even though by granting them private arbiters out of the congregation of the faithful, he does not simply condemn, but rather establishes private judgments, so that they are exercise without offence. Yet he shows that if they were such as they ought to be, and as it were to be wished, they should not need to use that remedy either.</note>Now therefore there is utterly a <note>A weakness of mind which is said to be in those that allow themselves to be overcome by their lusts, and it is a fault that differs greatly from temperance and moderation: so that he nips those who could not endure an injury done to them.</note> fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. <note>This pertains chiefly to the other part of the reprehension, that is, that they went to law even under infidels, whereas they should rather have suffered any loss, than to have given that offence. But yet this is generally true, that we ought rather to depart from our right, than try the uttermost of the law hastily, and upon an affection to revenge an injury. But the Corinthians cared for neither, and therefore he says that they must repent, unless they will be shut out of the inheritance of God.</note> Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Nay, yee your selues doe wrong, and doe harme, and that to your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? <note>Now he prepares himself to pass over to the fourth treatise of this epistle, which concerns other matters, concerning this matter first, how men may well use a woman or not. And this question has three parts: fornication, matrimony, and a single life. As for fornication, he utterly condemns it. And marriage he commands to some, as a good and necessary remedy for them: to others he leaves is free. And others he dissuades from it, not as unlawful, but as inconvenient, and that not without exception. As for singleness of life (under which also I comprehend virginity) he enjoins it to no man: yet he persuades men to it, but not for itself, but for another respect, neither to all men, nor without exception. And being about to speak against fornication, he begins with a general reprehension of those vices, with which that rich and riotous city most abounded: warning and teaching them earnestly, that repentance is inseparable joined with forgiveness of sins, and sanctification with justification.</note> Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>Nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherite the kingdome of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the <note>In Jesus.</note> name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>
          <note>Secondly, he shows that the Corinthians offend in small matters. First, because they abused them. Next, because they used indifferent things, without any discretion, seeing the use of them ought to be brought to the rule of charity. And that he does not use them correctly, who immoderately abuses them, and so becomes a slave to them.</note>
          <note>Whatever: but this general word must be restrained to things that are indifferent.</note>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the <note>He is in subjection to things that are indifferent, whoever he is that thinks he may not be without them. And this is a flattering type of slavery under a pretence of liberty, which seizes upon such men.</note> power of any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>
          <note>Secondly, because they counted many things as indifferent which were of themselves unlawful, as fornication, which they numbered among mere natural and lawful desires, as well as food and drink. Therefore the apostle shows that they are utterly unlike: for foods, he says, were made for the necessary use of man's life which is not perpetual: for both foods, and all this manner of nourishing, are quickly abolished. But we must not so think of the uncleanness of fornication, for which the body is not made, but on the other hand is ordained to purity, as appears by this, that is consecrated to Christ, even as Christ also is given us by his Father to enliven our bodies with that power with which he also rose again.</note>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God hath also raised vp the Lord, and shall raise vs vp by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>
          <note>A declaration of the former argument by opposites, and the application of it.</note>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>
          <note>A proof of the same argument: a harlot and Christ are completely contrary, so are the flesh and the Spirit. Therefore he that is one with a harlot (which is done by sexual intercourse with their bodies) cannot be one with Christ, which unity is pure and spiritual.</note>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for <note>Moses does not speak these words about fornication, but about marriage: but seeing that fornication is the corruption of marriage, and both of them are a carnal and fleshly copulation, we cannot say that the apostle abuses his testimony. Again, Moses does not have this word «two», but it is very well expressed both here and in (Mat_19:5), because he speaks only of man and wife: whereupon the opinion of those that vouch it to be lawful to have many wives is overthrown: for he that companies with many, is broken as it were into many parts.</note> two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But hee that is ioyned vnto the Lorde, is one spirite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>
          <note>Another argument why fornication is to be avoided, because it defiles the body with a peculiar type of filthiness.</note>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>
          <note>The third argument: because a fornicator is sacrilegious, because our bodies are consecrated to God.</note>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and <note>The fourth argument: because we are not our own men, to give ourselves to any other, much less to Satan and the flesh, seeing that God himself has bought us, and that with a great price, to the end that both in body and soul, we should serve to his glory.</note> ye are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For yee are bought for a price: therefore glorifie God in your bodie, and in your spirit: for they are Gods.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now <note>He teaches concerning marriage that although a single life has its advantages, which he will declare afterwards, yet that marriage is necessary for the avoiding of fornication. But so that neither one man may have many wives, nor any wife many husbands.</note> concerning the things <note>Concerning those matters about which you wrote to me.</note> whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] <note>Commodious, and (as we say) expedient.

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Neuertheles, to auoide fornication, let euery man haue his wife, and let euery woman haue her owne husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>
          <note>Secondly, he shows that the parties married must with singular affection entirely love one another.</note>Let the husband render unto the wife <note>The word «due» contains all types of benevolence, though he speaks more of one sort than of the other, in that which follows.</note> due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>
          <note>Thirdly, he warns them, that they are in each other's power, with regard to the body, so that they may not defraud one another.</note>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud ye not one the other, <note>He adds an exception: unless the one abstain from the other by mutual consent, that they may the better give themselves to prayer, in which nonetheless he warns them to consider what is expedient, lest by this long breaking off as it were from marriage, they are stirred up to incontinency.</note> except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may <note>Do nothing else.</note> give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>
          <note>Fifthly he teaches that marriage is not necessary for all men, but for those who do not have the gift of continency, and this gift is by a special grace of God.</note>But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I <note>I wish.</note> would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>
          <note>Sixthly, he gives the very same admonition touching the second marriage, that is, that a single life is to be allowed, but for those who have the gift of continency. Otherwise they ought to marry again, so that their conscience may be at peace.</note>I say therefore to the <note>This whole passage is completely against those who condemn second marriages.</note> unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to <note>So to burn with lust, that either the will yields to the temptation, or else we cannot call upon God with a peaceful conscience.</note> burn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>
          <note>Seventhly, he forbids contentions and the granting of divorces (for he speaks not here of the fault of whoredom, which was then death even by the law of the Romans also) by which he affirms that the band of marriage is not dissolved, and that from Christ's mouth.</note>And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But and if shee depart, let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled vnto her husband, &amp; let not the husband put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>
          <note>Eighthly, he affirms that those marriages which are already contracted between a faithful and an unfaithful or infidel, are firm: so that the faithful may not forsake the unfaithful.</note>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And the woman which hath an husbande that beleeueth not, if he be content to dwell with her, let her not forsake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>
          <note>He answers an objection: but the faithful is defiled by the company of the unfaithful. The apostle denies that, and proves that the faithful man with good conscience may use the vessel of his unfaithful wife, by this, that their children which are born of them are considered holy or legitimate (that is, contained within the promise): for it is said to all the faithful, «I will be your God, and the God of your seed.»</note>For the unbelieving husband is <note>The godliness of the wife is of more force to cause their marriage to be considered holy, than the infidelity of the husband is to profane the marriage.</note> sanctified by the <note>The infidel is not sanctified or made holy in his own person, but in respect of his wife, he is sanctified to her.</note> wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the <note>To the faithful husband.</note> husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they <note>The children are holy in the same sense that their parents are; that is they are sanctified, or lawfully espoused together, so the children born of them were in a civil and legal sense holy, that is, legitimate. (Ed.)</note> holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>
          <note>He answers a question: what if the unfaithful forsake the faithful? Then the faithful is free, he says, because he is forsaken by the unfaithful.</note>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in <note>When any such thing happens.</note> such [cases]: <note>Lest any man upon pretence of this liberty should give an occasion to the unfaithful to depart, he shows that marriage contracted with an infidel ought to be kept peaceably, that if it is possible the infidel may be won to the faith.</note> but God hath called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt saue thine husband? Or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt saue thy wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>
          <note>Taking occasion by that which he said of the bondage and liberty of matrimony, he digresses to a general doctrine concerning the outward state and condition of man's life, as circumcision and uncircumcision, servitude and liberty. And he warns every man generally to live with a contented mind in the Lord, whatever state or condition he is in, because those outward things, as to be circumcised or uncircumcised, to be bond or free, are not of the substance (as they call it) of the kingdom of heaven.</note>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath <note>Has bound him to a certain type of life.</note> called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>
          <note>Nonetheless he shows us that in these examples all are not of the same type: because circumcision is not simply of itself to be desired, but such as are bound may desire to be free. Therefore herein only they are equal that the kingdom of God consists not in them, and therefore these are no hindrance to obey God.</note>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not <note>He is said to become uncircumcised, who by the help of a surgeon, recovers an upper skin. And this is done by drawing the skin with an instrument, to make it to cover the head. Celsus in book 7, chapter 25.</note> become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing, and vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let euery man abide in the same vocation wherein he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Art thou called [being] a servant? <note>As though this calling were too unworthy a calling for Christ.</note> care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he that is called in the <note>He that is in the state of a servant, and is called to be a Christian.</note> Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ's servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>
          <note>He shows the reason of the unlikeness, because he that desired to be circumcised makes himself subject to man's tradition and not to God. And this may be much more understood of superstitions, which some do foolishly consider to as things indifferent.</note>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>
          <note>He commands virginity to no man, yet he persuades and praised it for another reason, that is, both for the necessity of the present time, because the faithful could scarce abide in any place, and use the commodities of this present life because of persecution. And therefore those who were not troubled with families, might be the readier, and also for the cares of this life, which marriage necessarily draws with it, so that they cannot but have their minds distracted: and this has place in women especially.</note>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my <note>The circumstances considered, this I counsel you.</note> judgment, as <note>It is I that speak this which I am minded to speak: and the truth is I am a man, but yet of worthy credit, for I have obtained from the Lord to be such a one.</note> one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</verse>

          <note>Now he turns himself to the parents, in whose power and authority their children are, warning them that according to the former doctrine they consider what is proper and convenient for their children. That they neither deprive them of the necessary remedy against incontinency, nor force them to marry, if neither their will does lead them, nor any necessity urges them. And again he praises virginity, but of itself, and not in all.</note>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he <note>He does well: for so he expounds it in (1Co_7:38).</note> sinneth not: let them marry.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now <note>He begins to entreat of another type of indifferent things, that is, things offered to idols, or the use of flesh so offered and sacrificed. And first of all he removes all those things which the Corinthians pretended in using things offered to idols without any respect. First of all they affirmed that this difference of foods was for the unskilful men, but as for them, they knew well enough the benefit of Christ, which causes all these things to be clean to those that are clean. Be it so, Paul says: even if we are all sufficiently instructed in the knowledge of Christ, I say nonetheless that we must not simply rest in this knowledge. The reason is, that unless our knowledge is tempered with charity, it does not only not avail, but also does much hurt, because it is the mistress of pride. Nay, it does not so much as deserve the name of godly knowledge, if it is separate from the love of God, and therefore from the love of our neighbour.</note> as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we <note>This general word is to be abridged as (1Co_8:7) appears, for there is a type of taunt in it, as we may perceive by (1Co_8:2).</note> all have knowledge.

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>
          <note>The application of that answer to things offered to idols: I grant, he says, that an idol is indeed a vain imagination, and that there is but one God and Lord, and therefore that food cannot be made either holy or profane by the idol. But it does not follow therefore, that a man may, without regard of what they are, use those foods as any other.</note>As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto <note>The word «idol» in this place is taken for an image which is made to represent some godhead, so that worship might be given to it: whereupon came the word «idolatry», that is to say, «image service».</note> idols, we know that an idol [is] <note>Is a vain dream.</note> nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God but one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>
          <note>The reason why that does not follow, is this: because there are many men who do not know that which you know.

          <note>An anticipation of an objection: why then will we therefore be deprived of our liberty? Nay, says the apostle, you will lose no part of Christianity although you abstain for your brethren's sake, as also if you receive the food, for it makes you in no way the more holy, for our commendation before God consists not in foods. But to use our liberty with offence of our brethren is an abuse of liberty, the true use of which is completely contrary, that is, to use it in such a way that we have consideration of our weak brethren.</note>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But take heede lest by any meanes this power of yours be an occasion of falling, to them that are weake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>
          <note>Another plain explication of the same reason, propounding the example of the sitting down at the table in the idol's temple. This thing the Corinthians did wrongly consider among things indifferent, because it is simply forbidden for the circumstance of the place, even though the offence had ceased, as it will be declared in its place.</note>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>
          <note>An amplification of the argument taken both of comparison and opposites: «You wretched man», he says, «pleasing yourself with your knowledge which indeed is not knowledge, for if you had true knowledge, you would not sit down to eat food in an idol's temple. Will you destroy your brother, hardening his weak conscience by this example to do evil, for whose salvation Christ himself has died?»</note>And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>
          <note>Another amplification: such offending of our weak brethren, results in the offending of Christ, and therefore do not let these men think that they have to deal only with their brethren.</note>But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>
          <note>The conclusion, which Paul conceives in his own person, that he might not seem to exact that of others which he will not be first subject to himself. I had rather (he says) abstain forever from all types of flesh, then give occasion of sin to any of my brethren. And on a smaller scale, in any certain place or time, I would refuse to eat flesh offered to idols, for my brother's sake.</note>Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.1'>Am <note>Before he proceeds any further in his purposed matter of things offered to idols, he would show the cause of all this evil, and also take it away. That is, that the Corinthians thought that they did not have to depart from the least amount of their liberty for any man's pleasure. Therefore he propounds himself for an example, and that in a matter almost necessary. And yet he speaks of both, but first of his own person. If (he says) you allege for yourselves that you are free, and therefore will use your liberty, am I not also free, seeing I am an apostle?</note> I not an apostle? am I not free? <note>He proves his apostleship by the effects, in that he was appointed by Christ himself, and the authority of his function was sufficiently confirmed to him among them by their conversion. And all these things he sets before their eyes, to make them ashamed because they would not in the least way that might be, debase themselves for the sake of the weak, whereas the apostle himself did all the he could to win them to God, when they were utterly reprobate and without God.</note> have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye <note>By the Lord.</note> my work in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.2'>If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the <note>As a seal by which it sufficiently appears that God is the author of my apostleship.</note> seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.3'>
          <note>He adds this by the way, as if he should say, «So far it is off, that you may doubt of my apostleship, that I use it to refute those who call it into controversy, by opposing those things which the Lord has done by me among you.»</note>Mine answer to them that do <note>Which like judges examine me and my doings.</note> examine me is this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.4'>
          <note>«Now concerning the matter itself», he says, «seeing that I am free, and truly an apostle, why may not I (I say not, eat of all things offered to idols) be maintained by my labours, indeed and keep my wife also, as the rest of the apostles lawfully do, as by name, John and James, the Lord's cousins, and Peter himself?»</note>Have we not power to <note>Upon the expense of the Church?</note> eat and to drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.5'>Have we not power to lead about a <note>One that is a Christian and a true believer.</note> sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.6'>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to <note>Not live by the works of our hands.</note> forbear working?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.7'>
          <note>That he may not seem to burden the apostles, he shows that it is just that they do, by an argument of comparison, seeing that soldiers live by their wages, and husbandmen by the fruits of their labours, and shepherds by that which comes of their flocks.</note>Who <note>Goes to warfare?</note> goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.8'>
          <note>Secondly, he brings forth the authority of God's institution by an argument of comparison.</note>Say I these things <note>Have I not better ground than the common custom of men?</note> as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.9'>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for <note>Was it God's proper intention to provide for oxen, when he made this law?

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Either saith hee it not altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt it is written, that he which eareth, should eare in hope, &amp; that he that thresheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope.</verse>

          <note>An assumption of the arguments with an amplification, for neither in so doing do we require a reward appropriate for our work.</note>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.12'>
          <note>Another argument of great force: others are nourished among you, therefore it was lawful for me, indeed rather for me than any other. And yet I refused it, and had rather still suffer any inconvenience, than the Gospel of Christ should be hindered.</note>If others be partakers of [this] <note>The word signifies right and interest, by which he shows us that the ministers of the word must by right and duty be supported by the Church.</note> power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.13'>
          <note>Last of all he brings forth the express law concerning the nourishing of the Levites, which privilege nonetheless he will not use.</note>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the <note>This is spoken by the figure of speech metonymy, for those things that are offered in the temple.</note> things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are <note>Are partakers with the altar in dividing the sacrifice.</note> partakers with the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.14'>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live <note>Because they preach the Gospel.

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>But I have used none of these things: <note>He takes away occasion of suspicion by the way, that it might not be thought that he wrote this as though he was demanding his wages that were not payed him. On the contrary, he says, I had rather die, than not to continue in this purpose to preach the Gospel freely. For I am bound to preach the Gospel, seeing that the Lord has given and commanded me this office: but unless I do it willingly and for the love of God, nothing that I do is to be considered worthwhile. If I had rather that the Gospel should be evil spoken of, than that I should not require my wages, then would it appear that I took these pains not so much for the Gospel's sake, as for my gains and advantages. But I say, this would not be to use, but rather to abuse my right and liberty: therefore not only in this thing, but also in all others (as much as I could) I am made all things to all men, that I might win them to Christ, and might together with them be won to Christ.</note> neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>For though I preach the Gospel, I haue nothing to reioyce of: for necessitie is laid vpon me, and woe is vnto me, if I preach not the Gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.24'>
          <note>He brings in another reason for this wrong, that is, that they were given to gluttony, for there were solemn banquets of sacrifices, and the loose living of the priests was always too much celebrated and kept. Therefore it was hard for those who were accustomed to loose living, especially when they pretended the liberty of the Gospel, to be restrained in these banquets. But on the other hand, the apostle calls them by a pleasant similitude, and also by his own example, to sobriety and mortification of the flesh, showing that they cannot be fit to run or wrestle (as then the games of Isthmies were) who pamper up their bodies. And therefore affirming that they can have no reward unless they take another course and manner of life.</note>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.25'>And every man that striveth for the mastery is <note>Uses a most excellent and moderate diet.</note> temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.1'>Moreover, <note>He sets out that which he said, laying before them an example of the horrible judgment of God against those who had in effect the very same pledges of the same adoption and salvation that we have. And yet nonetheless when they gave themselves to idol's feasts, they perished in the wilderness, being horribly and manifoldly punished. Now, moreover and besides that these things are fitly spoken against those who frequented idol's feasts, the same also seems to be alleged to this end and purpose, because many men think that those things are not of such great weight that God will be angry with them if they use them. And so they frequent Christian assemblies and are baptized, and receive the communion, and confess Christ.</note> brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our <note>Paul says this in respect of the covenant, and not in respect of the persons, except generally.</note> fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.2'>
          <note>In effect the ordinances of the old fathers were all one with ours, for they respected Christ alone, who offered himself to them in different forms.</note>And were all <note>All of them were baptized with the outward sign, but not indeed, because of which God cannot be blamed, but they themselves.</note> baptized unto <note>Moses being their guide.</note> Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</verse>

          <note>An amplifying of the example against those who are carried away with their lusts beyond the bounds which God has measured out. For this is the beginning of all evil, as of idolatry (which has gluttony as a companion), fornication, rebelling against Christ, murmuring, and such like. And these things God punished most sharply in that old people, to the end that we who succeed them, and have a more full declaration of the will of God, might by that means take better heed.</note>Now these things were our <note>Some read «figures»: which signified our ordinances.

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.12'>
          <note>In conclusion he descends to the Corinthians themselves, warning them that they do not please themselves, but rather that they prevent the wiles of Satan. Yet he uses an declaration and comforts them, that he may not seem to make them altogether similar to those wicked idolaters and condemners of Christ, who perished in the wilderness.</note>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.13'>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to <note>Which comes from weakness.</note> man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also <note>He that would have you tempted for your profit's sake, will make a way for you to escape out of the temptation.</note> make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.14'>Wherefore my beloued, flee from idolatrie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.15'>
          <note>Now returning to those idol's feasts, that he may not seem to delay at all: first he promises that he will use no other reasons, than such as they knew very well themselves. He gives the following line of reasoning. The holy banquets of the Christians are pledges, first of all, of the community that they have with Christ, and next, one with another. The Israelites also do ratify in the sacrifices, their mutual union in the very same religion. Therefore so do the idolaters also join themselves with their idols, or demons rather (for idols are nothing) in those solemn banquets, whereupon it follows, that that table is a table of demons, and therefore you must avoid it. For you cannot be partakers of the Lord and of idols together, much less may such banquets be considered as indifferent things. Will you then strive with God? And if you do, do you think that you will get the upper hand?</note>I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.16'>The cup of <note>Of thanksgiving: whereupon, that holy banquet was called «eucharist», which is Greek for thanksgiving.</note> blessing which we bless, is it not the <note>A most effectual pledge and note of your joining together with Christ, and ingrafting to him.</note> communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.17'>For we that are many, are one bread and one body, because we all are partakers of one bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.18'>Behold Israel after the <note>That is, those who yet observe their ceremonies.</note> flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices <note>Are consenting and guilty, both of that worship and sacrifice.</note> partakers of the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.19'>What say I then? that the idole is any thing? or that that which is sacrificed to idoles, is any thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.20'>But I [say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have <note>Have anything to do with the demons, or enter into that society which is begun in the demon's name.</note> fellowship with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.21'>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the <note>The heathen and profane people were accustomed to finish up and make an end of their feasts which they kept to the honour of their gods, in offering meat offerings and drink offerings to them, with banquets and feastings.</note> cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.22'>Doe we prouoke the Lord to anger? are we stronger then he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.23'>
          <note>Coming to another type of things offered to idols, he repeats that general rule, that in the use of indifferent things we ought to have consideration not of ourselves only, but of our neighbours. And therefore there are many things which of themselves are lawful, which may be evil when done by us, because of offence to our neighbour.</note>
          <note>See before in (1Co_6:13).</note>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.25'>
          <note>An applying of the rule to the present matter: whatever is sold in the market, you may indifferently buy it as if it were from the Lord's hand, and eat it either at home with the faithful, or being called home to the unfaithful, that is, in a private banquet. But yet with this exception, unless any man is present who is weak, whose conscience may be offended by setting meats offered to idols before them: for then you ought to have a consideration of their weakness.</note>Whatsoever is sold in the <note>The flesh that was sacrificed used to be sold in the markets, and the price returned to the priests.</note> shambles, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:</verse>

And this is through our fault, if we choose rather to offend the conscience of the weak, than to yield a little of our liberty in a matter of no importance, and so give occasion to the weak to judge in such sort of us, and of Christian liberty. And the apostle takes these things upon his own person, that the Corinthians may have so much the less occasion to oppose anything against him.</note> for why is my liberty judged of another [man's] conscience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.30'>For if I by <note>If I may through God's grace eat this meat or that meat, why should I through my fault cause that benefit of God to turn to my blame?</note> grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.31'>
          <note>The conclusion: we must order ourselves in such a way that we seek not ourselves, but God's glory, and so the salvation of as many as we may. In which the apostle does not thrust himself to the Corinthians (even his own flock) as an example, except so that he calls them back to Christ, to whom he himself has regard.</note>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</verse>

          <note>The fifth treatise of this epistle concerning the right ordering of public assemblies, containing three points, that is of the comely apparel of men and women, of the order of the Lord's supper, and of the right use of spiritual gifts. But going about to reprehend certain things, he begins nonetheless with a general praise of them, calling those particular laws of comeliness and honesty, which belong to the ecclesiastical policy, traditions: which afterward they called cannons.</note>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.3'>
          <note>He sets down God, in Christ our mediator, as the end and mark not only of doctrine, but also of ecclesiastical comeliness. Then applying it to the question proposed, touching the comely apparel both of men and women in public assemblies, he declares that the woman is one degree beneath the man by the ordinance of God, and that the man is so subject to Christ, that the glory of God ought to appear in him for the preeminence of the sex.</note>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the <note>In that Christ is our mediator.</note> head of Christ [is] God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.4'>
          <note>By this he gathers that if men do either pray or preach in public assemblies having their heads covered (which was then a sign of subjection), they robbed themselves of their dignity, against God's ordinance.</note>Every <note>It appears, that this was a political law serving only for the circumstance of the time that Paul lived in, by this reason, because in these our days for a man to speak bareheaded in an assembly is a sign of subjection.</note> man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.5'>
          <note>And in like manner he concludes that women who show themselves in public and ecclesiastical assemblies without the sign and token of their subjection, that is to say, uncovered, shame themselves.</note>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: <note>The first argument taken from the common sense of man, for so much as nature teaches women that it is dishonest for them to go abroad bareheaded, seeing that they have given to them thick and long hair which they do so diligently trim and deck, that they can in no way abide to have it shaved.</note> for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</verse>

          <note>The taking away of an objection: have not men also hair given to them? «I grant that», says the apostle, «but there is another matter in it.

          <note>A digression which the apostle uses, lest that which he spoke of the superiority of men, and the lower degree of women, in consideration of the policy of the Church, should be so taken as though there were no measure of this inequality. Therefore he teaches that men have in such sort the preeminence, that God made them not alone, but women also. And woman was so made of man, that men also are born by the means of women, and this ought to put them in mind to observe the degree of every sex in such sort, that the marriage relationship may be cherished.</note>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, <note>By the Lord.</note> in the Lord.</verse>

          <note>He passes now to the next treatise concerning the right administration of the Lord's supper. And the apostle uses this harsher preface, that the Corinthians might understand that whereas they generally observed the apostle's commandments, yet they badly neglected them in a matter of greatest importance.</note>Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.18'>
          <note>To celebrate the Lord's supper correctly, it is required that there is not only consent of doctrine, but also of affections, so that it is not profaned.</note>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.19'>
          <note>Although schisms and heresies proceed from the devil, and are evil, yet they come not by chance, nor without cause, and they turn to the profit of the elect.</note>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are <note>Whom experience has taught to be of sound religion and godliness.</note> approved may be made manifest among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.20'>When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is <note>This is a usual metaphor by which the apostle flatly denies that which many did not do well.</note> not to eat the Lord's supper.</verse>

          <note>The apostle thinks it good to take away the love feasts because of their abuse, although they had been practised a long time, and with commendation used in churches, and were appointed and instituted by the apostles.</note>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.23'>
          <note>We must take a true form of keeping the Lord's supper, out of the institution of it, the parts of which are these: touching the pastors, to show forth the Lord's death by preaching his word, to bless the bread and the wine by calling upon the name of God, and together with prayers to declare the institution of it, and finally to deliver the bread broken to be eaten, and the cup received to be drunk with thanksgiving. And touching the flock, that every man examine himself, that is to say, to prove both his knowledge, and also faith, and repentance: to show forth the Lord's death, that is, in true faith to yield to his word and institution: and last of all, to take the bread from the minister's hand, and to eat it and to drink the wine, and give God thanks. This was Paul's and the apostles' manner of ministering.</note>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.24'>And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is <note>This word «broken» denotes to us the manner of Christ's death, for although his legs were not broken, as the thieves legs were, yet his body was very severely tormented, and torn, and bruised.</note> broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.25'>After the same maner also he tooke the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the Newe Testament in my blood: this doe as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me.</verse>

          <note>Whoever condemns the holy ordinances, that is, uses them incorrectly, are guilty not of the bread and wine, but of the thing itself, that is, of Christ, and will be grievously punished for it.</note>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, <note>Otherwise than how such mysteries should properly be handled.</note> unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>
          <note>The examination of a man's self, is of necessity required in the supper, and therefore they ought not to be admitted to it who cannot examine themselves: such as children, furious and angry men, also such as either have no knowledge of Christ, or not sufficient, although they profess Christian religion: and others that cannot examine themselves.</note>But let <note>This passage overthrows the idea of the faith of merit, or undeveloped faith, which the papists maintain.</note> a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.</verse>

          <note>The profaning of the body and blood of the Lord in his mysteries is harshly punished by him, and therefore such wrongs ought diligently to be prevented by each one judging and correcting himself.</note>For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</verse>

          <note>The supper of the Lord was instituted not to feed the belly, but to feed the soul with the communion of Christ, and therefore it ought to be separated from common banquets.</note>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. <note>Such things as pertain to order, as place, time, form of prayers, and other such like, the apostle took order for in congregations according to the consideration of times, places, and persons.</note> And the rest will I set in order when I come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now <note>Now he enters into the third part of this treatise touching the right use of spiritual gifts, in which he gives the Corinthians plainly to understand that they abused them. For they that excelled bragged ambitiously of them, and so robbed God of the praise of his gifts: and having no consideration of their brethren, abused them to a vain display, and so robbed the church of the use of those gifts. On the other side the inferior sort envied the better, and went about to make a departure, so that all the body was as it were scatted and rent in pieces. So then, going about to remedy these abuses he wills them first to consider diligently that they have not these gifts of themselves, but from the free grace and liberality of God, to whose glory they ought to bestow them all.</note> concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you <note>Ignorant to what purpose these gifts are given to you.</note> ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>
          <note>He reproves the same by comparing their former state with that in which they were at this time, being endued with those excellent gifts.</note>Ye know that ye were <note>As touching God's service and the covenant, mere strangers.</note> Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>
          <note>The conclusion: know you therefore that you cannot so much as move your lips to honour Christ at all, except by the grace of the Holy Spirit.</note>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus <note>Does curse him, or by any means whatever diminish his glory.</note> accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>
          <note>In the second place, he lays another foundation, that is, that these gifts are different, as the functions also are different and their offices different, but that one self same Spirit, Lord, and God is the giver of all these gifts, and that to one end, that is, for the profit of all.</note>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the <note>The Spirit is plainly distinguished from the gifts.</note> same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are diuersities of administrations, but the same Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>And there are diversities of <note>So Paul calls that inward power which comes from the Holy Spirit, and makes men fit for wonderful things.</note> operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But the manifestation of the Spirit is <note>The Holy Spirit opens and shows himself freely in the giving of these gifts.</note> given to every man to <note>To the use and benefit of the church.</note> profit withal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>
          <note>He declares this manifold diversity, and reckons up the principal gifts, beating that into their heads which he said before, that is, that all these things proceeded from one and the very same Spirit.</note>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of <note>Wisdom is a most excellent gift, and very needed, not only for those who teach, but also for those that exhort and comfort. And this thing is proper to the pastor's office, as the word of knowledge agrees to the teachers.</note> wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>And to another is giuen faith by the same Spirit: and to another the giftes of healing, by the same Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>To another the <note>By «working» he means those great workings of God's mighty power, which pass and excel among his miracles, as the delivery of his people by the hand of Moses: that which he did by Elijah against the priests of Baal, in sending down fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice: and that which he did by Peter, in the matter of Ananias and Sapphira.</note> working of miracles; to another <note>Foretelling of things to come.</note> prophecy; to another <note>By which false prophets are know from true, in which Peter surpassed Philip in exposing Simon Magus; (Act_8:20).</note> discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally <note>He adds moreover somewhat else, that is, that although these gifts are unequal, yet they are most wisely divided, because the will of the Spirit of God is the rule of this distribution.</note> as he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>
          <note>He sets forth his former saying by a similitude taken from the body: this, he says, is manifestly seen in the body, whose members are different, but yet so joined together, that they make but one body.</note>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: <note>The applying of the similitude. So must we also think, he says, of the mystical body of Christ: for all we who believe, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, are by one person by the same baptism, joined together with our head, that by that means, there may be framed one body compact of many members. And we have drunk one self same spirit, that is to say, a spiritual feeling, perseverance and motion common to us all out of one cup.</note> so also [is] <note>Christ joined together with his Church.</note> Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into <note>To become one body with Christ.</note> one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to <note>By one quickening drink of the Lord's blood, we are made partakers of his Spirit alone.</note> drink into one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>
          <note>He amplifies that which followed of the similitude, as if he should say, «The unity of the body is not prevented by this diversity of members, and furthermore it could not be a body if it did not consist of many members, and those being different.»</note>For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>
          <note>Now he builds his doctrine upon the foundations which he has laid: and first of all he continues in his purposed similitude, and afterward he goes to the matter plainly and simply. And first of all he speaks unto those who would have separated themselves from those whom they envied, because they had not such excellent gifts as they. Now this is, he says, as if the foot should say it were not of the body, because it is not the hand, or the ear, because it is not the eye. Therefore all parts ought rather to defend the unity of the body, being coupled together to serve one another.</note>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the eare would say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>
          <note>Again speaking to them, he shows them that if that should come to pass which they desire, that is, that all should be equal one to another, there would follow a destruction of the whole body, indeed and of themselves. For it could not be a body unless it were made of many members knit together, and different from one another. And that no man might find fault with this division as unequal, he adds that God himself has joined all these together. Therefore all must remain joined together, that the body may remain in safety.</note>If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But nowe hath God disposed the members euery one of them in the bodie at his owne pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>For if they were all one member, where were the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now are there many members, yet but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>
          <note>Now on the other hand, he speaks to those who were endued with more excellent gifts, exhorting them not to despise the inferiors as unprofitable, and as though they served to no use. For God, he says, has in such sort tempered this inequality, that the more excellent and beautiful members can in no wise lack the more abject and such as we are ashamed of, and that they should have more care to see to them and to cover them: that by this means the necessity which is on both parts, might keep the whole body in peace and harmony. And that even though if each part is considered apart, they are of different degrees and conditions, yet because they are joined together, they have a community both in prosperity and affliction.</note>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be <note>Of the smallest and vilest offices, and therefore mentioned last among the rest.</note> more feeble, are necessary:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant <note>We more carefully cover them.</note> honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>For our comely partes neede it not: but God hath tempered the body together, and hath giuen the more honour to that part which lacked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same <note>Should bestow their operations and offices to the profit and preservation of the whole body.</note> care one for another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>
          <note>Now he applies this same doctrine to the Corinthians without any allegory, warning them that as there are different functions and different gifts, it is their duty not to offend one another, either by envy or ambition. Instead, in being joined together in love and charity with one another, every one of them should bestow to the profit of all that which he has received, according as his ministry requires.</note>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in <note>For all churches, wherever they are dispersed through the whole world, are different members of one body.</note> particular.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, <note>The offices of deacons.</note> helps, <note>He sets forth the order of elders, who were the maintainers of the church's discipline.</note> governments, diversities of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Are all Apostles? are all Prophetes? are all teachers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Are all doers of miracles? haue all the gifts of healing? doe all speake with tongues? doe all interprete?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>
          <note>He teaches those who are ambitious and envious, a certain holy ambition and envy. That is, if they give themselves to the best gifts, and such as are most profitable to the church, and so if they contend to excel one another in love, which far surpasses all other gifts.</note>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though <note>He reasons first of charity, the excellency of which he first shows by this, that without it, all other gifts are as nothing before God. And this he proves partly by an induction, and partly also by an argument taken of the end, for what reason those gifts are given. For, to what purpose are those gifts but to God's glory, and the profit of the Church as is before proved? So that those gifts, without charity, have no right use.</note> I speak with the tongues of men and of <note>A very earnest amplifying of the matter, as if he said, «If there were any tongues of angels, and I had them, and did not use them to the benefit of my neighbour, it would be nothing else except a vain and prattling type of babbling.»</note> angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a <note>That gives a rude and uncertain sound.</note> tinkling cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all <note>By «faith» he means the gift of doing miracles, and not that faith which justifies, which cannot be void of charity as the other may.</note> faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I feede the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my body, that I be burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>
          <note>He describes the force and nature of charity, partly by a comparison of opposites, and partly by the effects of charity itself. And by this the Corinthians may understand both how profitable it is in the church, and how necessary: and also how far they are from it, and therefore how vainly and without cause they are proud.</note>Charity <note>Literally, «defers wrath».</note> suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Doth <note>It is not insolent, or reproachful.</note> not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but <note>Rejoices at righteousness in the righteous. For by «truth» the Hebrews mean «righteousness».</note> rejoiceth in the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>It suffreth all things: it beleeueth all things: it hopeth all things: it endureth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>
          <note>Again he commends the excellency of charity, in that it will never be abolished in the saints, whereas the other gifts which are necessary for the building up of the church, so long as we live here, will have no place in the world to come.</note>Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] <note>The getting of knowledge by prophesying.</note> knowledge, it shall vanish away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>
          <note>The reason: because we are now in the state that we have need to learn daily, and therefore we have need of those helps, that is, of the gift of tongues, and knowledge, and also of those that teach by them. But to what purpose serve they then, when we have obtained and gotten the full knowledge of God, which serve now but for those who are imperfect and go by degrees to perfection?</note>For we know in <note>We learn imperfectly.</note> part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when that which is perfect, is come, then that which is in part, shalbe abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>
          <note>He sets forth that which he said by an excellent similitude, comparing this life to our infancy, or childhood, in which we mutter and stammer rather than speak, and think and understand childish things, and therefore have need of such things as may form and frame our tongue and mind. But when we become men, to what purpose should we desire that stammering, those childish toys, and such like things, by which we are formed in our childhood by little and little?</note>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>
          <note>The applying of the similitude of our childhood to this present life, in which we darkly behold heavenly things, according to the small measure of light which is given to us, through the understanding of tongues, and hearing the teachers and ministers of the Church. And our man's age and strength is compared to that heavenly and eternal life, in which when we behold God himself present, and are enlightened with his full and perfect light, to what purpose would we desire the voice of man, and those worldly things which are most imperfect? But yet then all the saints will be knit both with God, and between themselves with most fervent love. And therefore charity will not be abolished, but perfected, although it will not be shown forth and entertained by such manner of duties as belong only and especially to the infirmity of this life.</note>For <note>All this must be understood by comparison.</note> now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>
          <note>The conclusion: as if the apostle should say, «Such therefore will be our condition then: but now we have three things, and they remain sure if we are Christ's, without which, true religion cannot consist, that is, faith, hope, and charity. And among these, charity is the chiefest because it ceases not in the life to come as the rest do, but is perfected and accomplished. For seeing that faith and hope tend to things which are promised and are to come, when we have presently gotten them, to what purpose would we have faith and hope? But yet there at length we will truly and perfectly love both God and one another.»</note>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow <note>He infers now of what he spoke before: therefore seeing charity is the chiefest of all, before all things set it before you as chief and principal. And so esteem those things as most excellent which profit the greater part of men (such as prophecy, that is to say, the gift of teaching and applying the doctrine: which was condemned in respect of other gifts, although it is the chiefest and most necessary for the Church) and not those who for a show seem to be marvellous, as the gifts of tongues. This was when a man was suddenly endowed with the knowledge of many tongues, which made men greatly amazed and yet of itself was not greatly of any use, unless there was an interpreter.</note> after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may <note>What prophecy is he shows in the third verse.</note> prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>
          <note>He reprehends their perverse judgment concerning the gift of tongues. For why was it given? The answer: so that the mysteries of God might be the better known to a greater number. By this it is evident that prophecy, which the gift of tongues ought to serve, is better than this: and therefore the Corinthians judged incorrectly, in that they made more account of the gift of tongues than of prophesying: because no doubt the gift of tongues was a thing more to be bragged of. And hereupon followed another abuse of the gift of tongues, in that the Corinthians used tongues in the congregation without an interpreter. And although this thing might be done to some profit of him that spoke them, yet he corrupted the right use of that gift because there came by it no profit to the hearers. And common assemblies were instituted and appointed not for any private man's commodity, but for the profit of the whole company.</note>For he that speaketh in an [unknown] <note>A strange language, which no man can understand without an interpreter.</note> tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth [him]; howbeit in the <note>By that inspiration which he has received of the Spirit, which nonetheless he abuses, when he speaks mysteries which none of the company can understand.</note> spirit he speaketh mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to] <note>Which may further men in the study of godliness.</note> edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the <note>The company.</note> church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I would that ye all spake strange languages, but rather that ye prophecied: for greater is hee that prophecieth, then hee that speaketh diuers tongues, except hee expounde it, that the Church may receiue edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>And nowe, brethren, if I come vnto you speaking diuers tongues, what shall I profite you, except I speake to you, either by reuelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecying, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>
          <note>He sets forth that which he said by a similitude, which he borrows and takes from instruments of music, which although they speak not perfectly, yet they are distinguished by their sounds, that they may be the better used.</note>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And also if the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to battell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words <note>That fitly utter the matter itself.</note> easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>
          <note>He proves that interpretation is necessarily to be joined with the gift of tongues, by the manifold variety of languages, insomuch that if one speak to another without an interpreter, it is as if he did not speak.</note>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that <note>As the papists in all their sermons, and they that ambitiously pour out some Hebrew or Greek words in the pulpit before the unlearned people, by this to get themselves a name of vain learning.</note> speaketh [shall be] a barbarian unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>
          <note>The conclusion: if they will excel in those spiritual gifts, as it is proper, they must seek the profit of the church. And therefore they must not use the gift of tongues, unless there is an interpreter to expound the strange and unknown tongue, whether it is himself that speaks, or another interpreter.</note>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue <note>Pray for the gift of interpretation.</note> pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>
          <note>A reason: because it is not sufficient for us to speak so in the congregation that we ourselves worship God in spirit (that is according to the gift which we have received), but we must also be understood of the company, lest that is unprofitable to others which we have spoken.</note>For <note>If I pray, when the church is assembled together, in a strange tongue.</note> if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my <note>The gift and inspiration which the spirit gives me does its part, but only to myself.</note> spirit prayeth, but my understanding is <note>No fruit comes to the church by my prayers.</note> unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the <note>So that I may be understood by others, and may instruct others.</note> understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>
          <note>Another reason: seeing that the whole congregation must agree with him that speaks, and also witness this agreement, how will they give their assent or agreement who know not what is spoken?</note>Else when thou shalt bless with the <note>Alone, without any consideration of the hearers.</note> spirit, how shall he that <note>He that sits as a private man.</note> occupieth the room of the unlearned say <note>So then one uttered the prayers, and all the company answered «amen».</note> Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou verely giuest thankes well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>
          <note>He sets himself as an example, both that they may be ashamed of their foolish ambition, and also that he may avoid all suspicion of envy.</note>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>Yet in the church I had rather speak <note>A very few words.</note> five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>
          <note>Now he reproves those freely for their childish folly, who do not see how this gift of tongues which was given to the profit of the Church, is turned by their ambition into an instrument of cursing, seeing that this same cursing is also contained among the punishments with which God punished the stubbornness of his people, that he dispersed them amongst strangers whose language they did not understand.</note>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the <note>By the «law» he understands the entire scripture.</note> law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>
          <note>The conclusion: therefore the gift of tongues serves to punish the unfaithful and unbelievers, unless it is referred to prophecy (that is to say, to the interpretation of scripture) and that what is spoken is by the means of prophecy is understood by the hearers.</note>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>
          <note>Another argument: the gift of tongues without prophecy is not only unprofitable to the faithful, but also hurts very much, both the faithful as well as the unfaithful, who should be won in the public assemblies. For by this means it comes to pass that the faithful seem to others to be mad, much less can the unfaithful be instructed by it.</note>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] <note>See (Act_4:13).</note> unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophecie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, or one vnlearned, hee is rebuked of all men, and is iudged of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so he will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say plainely that God is in you in deede.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>
          <note>The conclusion: the edifying of the congregation is a rule and measure of the right use of all spiritual gifts.</note>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>
          <note>The manner how to use the gift of tongues. It may be lawful for one or two, or at the most for three, to use the gift of tongues, one after another in an assembly, so that there is someone to expound their utterances. But if there are none to expound, let him that has the gift speak to himself alone.</note>If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there be no interpreter, let him keepe silence in the Church, which speaketh languages, and let him speake to himselfe, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>
          <note>The manner of prophesying: let two or three propound, and let the others judge of that which is propounded, whether it is agreeable to the word of God or not. If in this examination the Lord indicates that nothing was wrong, let them give him leave to speak. Let every man be admitted to prophesy, severally and in his order, so far forth as it is required for the edifying of the church. Let them be content to be subject to each other's judgment.</note>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>And if any thing be reueiled to another that sitteth by, let the first holde his peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye may all prophecie one by one, that all may learne, and all may haue comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the <note>The doctrine which the prophets bring, who are inspired with God's Spirit.</note> spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as we see in all ye Churches of the Saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>
          <note>Women are commanded to be silent in public assemblies, and they are commanded to ask of their husbands at home.</note>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speake in the Church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>
          <note>A general conclusion of the treatise of the right use of spiritual gifts in assemblies. And this is with a sharp reprehension, lest the Corinthians might seem to themselves to be the only ones who are wise.</note>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or <note>Skilful in knowing and judging spiritual things.</note> spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>
          <note>The church ought not to care for those who are stubbornly ignorant, and will not abide to be taught, but to go forward nonetheless in those things which are right.</note>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>
          <note>Prophecy ought certainly to be retained and kept in congregations, and the gift of tongues is not to be forbidden, but all things must be done orderly.</note>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done honestly, and by order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Moreover, <note>The sixth treatise of this epistle, concerning the resurrection: and he uses a transition, or passing over from one matter to another, showing first that he brings no new thing, to the end that the Corinthians might understand that they had begun to swerve from the right course. And next that he does not go about to entreat of a trifling matter, but of another chief point of the Gospel, which if it is taken away, their faith will necessarily come to nothing. And so at the length he begins this treatise at Christ's resurrection, which is the ground and foundation of ours, and confirms it first by the testimony of the scriptures and by the witness of the apostles, and of more than five hundred brethren, and last of all by his own.</note> brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye <note>In the profession of which you still continue.</note> stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, <note>Which is very absurd, and cannot be, for they that believe must reap the fruit of faith.</note> unless ye have believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For first of all, I deliuered vnto you that which I receiued, how that Christ died for our sinnes, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>And that he was buried, and that he arose the third day, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the <note>Of those twelve picked and chosen apostles, who were commonly called twelve, though Judas was put out of the number.</note> twelve:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at <note>Not at several different times, but together and at one instant.</note> once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that, he was seene of Iames: then of all the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>
          <note>He maintains along the way the authority of his apostleship, which was required to be in good credit among the Corinthians, that this epistle might be of force and weight among them. In the mean time he compares himself, under divine inspiration, in such a way with certain others, that he makes himself inferior to them all.</note>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the Apostles, which am not meete to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God, I am that I am: and his grace which is in me, was not in vaine: but I laboured more aboundantly then they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Wherefore, whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so haue ye beleeued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>
          <note>The first argument to prove that there is a resurrection from the dead: Christ is risen again, therefore the dead will rise again.</note>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>
          <note>The second by an absurdity: if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.</note>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>
          <note>The proof of that absurdity, by other absurdities: if Christ is not risen again, the preaching of the Gospel is in vain, and the credit that you gave to it is vain, and we are liars.</note>And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And we are found also false witnesses of God: for we haue testified of God, that he hath raised vp Christ: whome he hath not raised vp, if so be the dead be not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>
          <note>He repeats the same argument taken from an absurdity, purposing to show how faith is in vain if the resurrection of Christ is taken away.</note>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; <note>First, seeing death is the punishment of sin, in vain should we believe that our sins were forgiven us, if they remain: but they do remain, if Christ did not rise from death.</note> ye are <note>They are yet in their sins who are not sanctified, nor have obtained remission of their sins.</note> yet in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>
          <note>Secondly, unless it is certain that Christ rose again, all those who died in Christ have perished. So then, what profit comes of faith?</note>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>
          <note>The third argument which is also taken from an absurdity: for unless there is another life, in which those who trust and believe in Christ will be blessed, they are the most miserable of all creatures, because in this life they would be the most miserable.</note>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>
          <note>A conclusion of the former argument: therefore Christ is risen again.</note>But now is Christ risen from the dead, <note>He puts the last conclusion for the first proposition of the argument that follows. Christ is risen again: therefore will we the faithful (for of them he speaks) rise again. Then follows the first reason of this conclusion: for Christ is set forth to us to be considered of, not as a private man apart and by himself, but as the firstfruits: and he takes that which was known to all men, that is, that the whole heap is sanctified in the firstfruits.</note> [and] become the <note>He alludes to the firstfruits of grain, the offering of which sanctified the rest of the fruits.</note> firstfruits of them that slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>
          <note>Another confirmation of the same conclusion: for Christ is to be considered as opposite to Adam, that as from one man Adam, sin came over all, so from one man Christ, life comes to all. That is to say, that all the faithful, who die because by nature they were born of Adam, so because in Christ they are made the children of God by grace, they are made alive and restored to life by him.</note>For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be <note>Will rise by the power of Christ.</note> made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>
          <note>He does two things together: for he shows that the resurrection is in such sort common to Christ with all his members, that nonetheless he far surpasses them, both in time (for he was the first that rose again from the dead) and also in honour, because from him and in him is all our life and glory. Then by this occasion he passes to the next argument.</note>But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>
          <note>The fourth argument with which also he confirms the other, has a most sure ground, that is, because God must reign. And this is the manner of his reign, that the Father will be shown to be King in his Son who was made man, to whom all things are made subject (the promiser being the only exception) to the end that the Father may afterward triumph in his Son the conqueror. And he makes two parts of this reign and dominion of the Son in which the Father's glory consists: that is first, the overcoming of his enemies, in which some must be deprived of all power, as Satan and all the wicked, be they ever so proud and mighty, and others must be utterly abolished, as death. And second, a plain and full delivery of the godly from all enemies, that by this means God may fully set forth the body of the Church cleaving fast to their head Christ, his kingdom and glory, as a King among his subjects. Moreover he puts the first degree of his kingdom in the resurrection of the Son, who is the head: and the perfection, in the full conjunction of the members with the head, which will be in the latter day. Now all these tend to this purpose, to show that unless the dead do rise again, neither the Father can be King above all, neither Christ the Lord of all. For neither should the power of Satan and death be overcome, nor the glory of God be full in his Son, nor his Son in his members.</note>Then [cometh] the <note>The conclusion and finishing of all things.</note> end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down <note>All his enemies who will be robbed of all the power that they have.</note> all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies <note>Christ is considered here as he appeared in the form of a servant, in which respect he rules the Church as head, and that because this power was given to him from his Father.</note> under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The <note>The conclusion of the argument, which is taken from the whole to the part: for if all his enemies will be put under his feet, then it will necessarily be that death also will be subdued under him.</note> last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For he hath put downe all things vnder his feete. (And when he saith that all things are subdued to him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put downe all things vnder him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, <note>Not because the Son was not subject to his Father before, but because his body, that is to say, the Church which is here in distress, and not yet wholly partaker of his glory, is not yet fully perfect: and also because the bodies of the saints which are in the graves, will not be glorified until the resurrection. But Christ as he is God, has us subject to him as his Father has, but as he is Priest, he is subject to his Father together with us. Augustine, book 1, chap. 8, of the trinity.</note> then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that <note>By this high type of speech is set forth an incomprehensible glory which flows from God, and will fill all of us, as we are joined together with our head, but yet in such a way that our head will always preserve his preeminence.</note> God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>
          <note>The fifth argument taken of the end of baptism, that is, because those who are baptized, are baptized for dead: that is to say, that they may have a remedy against death, because baptism is a token of regeneration.</note>Else what shall they do which are baptized <note>They that are baptized to this end and purpose, that death may be put out in them, or to rise again from the dead, of which baptism is a seal.</note> for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>
          <note>The sixth argument: unless there is a resurrection of the dead, why should the apostles so daily cast themselves into danger of so many deaths?</note>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I protest by your <note>As though he said, «I die daily, as all the miseries I suffer can well witness, which I may truly boast of, that I have suffered among you.»</note> rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>
          <note>The taking away of an objection: but you, Paul, were ambitious, as men commonly and are accustomed to be, when you fought with beasts at Ephesus. That is very likely, says Paul: for what could that profit me, were it not for the glory of eternal life which I hope for?</note>If <note>Not upon any godly motion, nor casting my eyes upon God, but carried away with vain glory, or a certain headiness.</note> after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? <note>The seventh argument which depends upon the last: if there is no resurrection of the dead, why do we give ourselves to anything else, except for eating and drinking?</note> let us <note>These are sayings of the Epicureans.</note> eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>
          <note>The conclusion with a sharp exhortation, that they take heed of the wicked company of certain ones. And from this he shows where this evil sprang from: warning them to be wise with sobriety to righteousness.</note>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to liue righteously, and sinne not: for some haue not ye knowledge of God, I speake this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>
          <note>Now that he has proved the resurrection, he demonstrates their doltishness, in that they scoffingly demanded how it could be that the dead could rise again: and if they did rise again, they asked mockingly, what manner of bodies they should have. Therefore he sends these fellows, who seemed to themselves to be marvellously wise and intelligent, to be instructed of poor rude farmers.</note>But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>
          <note>You might have learned either of these, Paul says, by daily experience: for seeds are sown, and rot, and yet nonetheless they are far from perishing, but rather they grow up far more beautiful. And whereas they are sown naked and dry, they spring up green from death by the power of God: and does it seem incredible to you that our bodies should rise from corruption, and that endued with a far more excellent quality?</note>[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shalbe, but bare corne as it falleth, of wheat, or of some other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>
          <note>We see a diversity both in one and the self same thing which has now one form and then another, and yet keeps its own type: as it is evident in a grain which is sown bare, but springs up far after another sort: and also in different types of one self same sort, as among beasts: and also among things of different sorts, as the heavenly bodies and the earthly bodies; which also differ very much one from another. Therefore there is no reason why we should reject either the resurrection of the bodies, or the changing of them into a better state, as a thing impossible, or strange.</note>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beastes, and another of fishes, and another of birdes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also heauenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but the glorie of the heauenly is one, and the glorie of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is another glorie of the sunne, and another glorie of the moone, and another glorie of the starres: for one starre differeth from another starre in glorie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>
          <note>He makes three manner of qualities of the bodies being raised: first, incorruption, that is, because they will be sound and altogether of a nature that can not be corrupt. Second, glory, because they will be adorned with beauty and honour. Third, power, because they will continue everlasting, without food, drink, and all other helps, without which this frail life cannot keep itself from corruption.</note>So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is <note>Is buried, and man is hid as seed in the ground.</note> sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in <note>Void of honour, void of glory and beauty.</note> dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in <note>Freed from the former weakness, in which it is subject to such alteration and change, that it cannot maintain itself without food and drink and such other like helps.</note> power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>
          <note>He shows perfectly in one word this change of the quality of the body by the resurrection, when he says that a natural body will become a spiritual body: which two qualities being completely different the one from the other he straightway expounds, and sets forth diligently.</note>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>
          <note>That is called a natural body which is made alive and maintained by a living soul only in the manner that Adam was, of whom we are all born naturally. And that is said to be a spiritual body, which together with the soul is made alive with a far more excellent power, that is, with the Spirit of God, who descends from Christ the second Adam to us.</note>And so it is written, The <note>Adam is called the first man, because he is the root as it were from which we spring. And Christ is the latter man, because he is the beginning of all those that are spiritual, and in him we are all included.</note> first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a <note>Christ is called a Spirit, by reason of that most excellent nature, that is to say, God who dwells in him bodily, as Adam is called a living soul, by reason of the soul which is the best part in him.</note> quickening spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>
          <note>Secondly, he wills the order of this twofold state or quality to be observed, that the natural was first, Adam being created of the clay of the earth. And the spiritual follows and came upon it, that is, when the Lord being sent from heaven, endued our flesh, which was prepared and made fit for him, with the fulness of the Godhead.</note>Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man [is] of the earth, <note>Wallowing in dirt, and wholly given to an earthly nature.</note> earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from <note>As Adam was the first man, Christ is the second man; and these two are spoken of, as if they were the only two men in the world; because as the former was the head and representative of all his natural posterity, so the latter is the head and representative of all the spiritual offspring: and that he is «the Lord from heaven»; in distinction from the first man. (Ed.)</note> heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>
          <note>He applies both the earthly naturalness of Adam (if I may so say) to our bodies, so long as they are naturally conversant upon earth, that is, in this life, and in the grave. And also the spirituality of Christ to our same bodies, after they are risen again: and he says that the former goes before, and that this latter will follow.</note>As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the <note>Not a vain and false image, but such a one as indeed had the truth with it.</note> image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>
          <note>The conclusion: we cannot be partakers of the glory of God unless we put off all that gross and filthy nature of our bodies subject to corruption, that the same body may be adorned with incorruptible glory.</note>Now this I say, brethren, that <note>Flesh and blood are taken here for a living body, which cannot attain to incorruption, unless it puts off corruption.</note> flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>
          <note>He goes further, declaring that it will come to pass that those who will be found alive in the latter day will not descend into that corruption of the grave, but will be renewed with a sudden change, which change is very necessary. And he further states that the certain enjoying of the benefit and victory of Christ, is deferred to that latter time.</note>Behold, I shew you a <note>A thing that has been hid, and never known before now, and therefore worthy that you give good care to it.</note> mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>In <note>He shows that the time will be very short.</note> a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortall must put on immortalitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortall hath put on immortalitie, then shalbe brought to passe the saying that is written, Death is swallowed vp into victorie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death where is thy sting? O graue where is thy victorie?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sinne: and ye strength of sinne is the Lawe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>
          <note>An exhortation taken from the profit that ensues, that seeing they understand that the glory of the other life is laid up for faithful workmen, they continue and stand fast in the truth of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.</note>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the <note>Through the Lord's help and goodness working in us.</note> Lord.</verse>
