      <chapter osisID='Eccl.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.1'>The words of the <note>Solomon is here called a preacher, or one who assembles the people, because he teaches the true knowledge of God, and how men ought to pass their life in this transitory world.</note> Preacher, the son of David, king of Jerusalem. <note>The Argument - Solomon as a preacher and one that desired to instruct all in the way of salvation, describes the deceivable vanities of this world: that man should not be addicted to anything under the sun, but rather inflamed with the desire of the heavenly life: therefore he confutes their opinions, which set their happiness either in knowledge or in pleasures, or in dignity and riches, wishing that man's true happiness consists in that he is united with God and will enjoy his presence: so that all other things must be rejected, save in as much as they further us to attain to this heavenly treasure, which is sure and permanent, and cannot be found in any other save in God alone.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.2'>
          <note>He condemns the opinions of all men who set happiness in anything but in God alone, seeing that in this world all things are as vanity and nothing.</note>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.3'>What profit hath a man of all his <note>Solomon does not condemn man's labour or diligence, but shows that there is no full contentment in anything under the heavens, nor in any creature, as all things are transitory.</note> labour which he taketh under the sun?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.4'>[One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for <note>One man dies after another, and the earth remains longest, even to the last day, which yet is subject to corruption.</note> ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.5'>The sunne riseth, and ye sunne goeth downe, and draweth to his place, where he riseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.6'>The <note>By the sun, wind and rivers, he shows that the greatest labour and longest has an end, and therefore there can be no happiness in this world.</note> wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about to the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.7'>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; to the place from <note>The sea which compasses all the earth, fills the veins of it which pour out springs and rivers into the sea again.</note> which the rivers come, there they return again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.8'>All things are full of labour: man cannot vtter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.9'>
          <note>He speaks of times and seasons, and things done in them, which as they have been in times past, so come they to pass again.</note>The thing that hath been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.10'>Is there any thing, whereof one may say, Beholde this, it is newe? It hath bene already in the olde time that was before vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.11'>There is no memorie of the former, neither shall there be a remembrance of the latter that shalbe, with them that shall come after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.12'>
          <note>He proves that if any could have attained happiness in this world by labour and study, he should have obtained it, because he had gifts and aids from God to it above all others.</note>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.13'>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this grievous labour hath God given to the sons of man <note>Man by nature has a desire to know, and yet is not able to come to the perfection of knowledge, which is the punishment of sin, to humble man, and to teach him to depend only on God.</note> to be exercised with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.14'>I haue considered all the workes that are done vnder the sunne, and beholde, all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.15'>[That which is] <note>Man is not able by all his diligence to cause things to go other than they do: neither can he number the faults that are committed, much less remedy them.</note> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.16'>I thought in mine heart, and said, Behold, I am become great, and excell in wisdome all them that haue bene before me in Ierusalem: and mine heart hath seene much wisedome and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.17'>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know <note>That is, vain things, which served to pleasure, in which was no convenience, but grief and trouble of conscience.</note> madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.18'>For in much wisdom [is] much <note>Wisdom and knowledge cannot be come by without great pain of body and mind: for when a man has attained the highest, yet is his mind never fully content: therefore in this world is no true happiness.</note> grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.1'>I said in my heart, Come now, I will tempt <note>Solomon makes this discourse with himself, as though he would try whether there was contentment in ease and pleasures.</note> thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.2'>I saide of laughter, Thou art mad: and of ioy, What is this that thou doest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.3'>I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with <note>Even though I gave myself to pleasures, yet I thought to keep wisdom and the fear of God in my heart, and govern my affairs by the same.</note> wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.4'>I haue made my great workes: I haue built me houses: I haue planted me vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.5'>I haue made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.6'>I haue made me cisternes of water, to water therewith the woods that growe with trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.7'>I procured [me] male and female servants, and had servants born in my <note>Meaning, of the servants or slaves which he had bought, so the children born in their servitude, were the masters.</note> house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.8'>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the special treasure of kings and of the provinces: I procured me male and female singers, and the <note>That is, whatever men take pleasure in.</note> delights of the sons of men, <note>Or, the most beautiful of the women that were taken in war, as in (Jdg_5:30).</note> [as] musical instruments, and of all sorts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.9'>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom <note>For all this God did not take his gift of wisdom from me.</note> remained with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.10'>And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my <note>This was the fruit of all my labour, a certain pleasure mixed with care, which he calls vanity in the next verse.</note> portion of all my labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.11'>Then I looked on all my workes that mine hands had wrought, and on the trauaile that I had laboured to doe: and beholde, all is vanitie and vexation of the spirit: and there is no profite vnder the sunne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.12'>And I turned myself to behold <note>I thought to myself whether it was better to follow wisdom, or my own affections and pleasures, which he calls madness.</note> wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what [can] the man [do] that cometh after the king? [even] that which hath been already done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.13'>Then I saw that there is profite in wisdome, more then in follie: as the light is more excellent then darkenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.14'>The wise man's <note>Meaning, in this world.</note> eyes [are] in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one <note>For both die and are forgotten as in (Ecc_2:16) or they both alike have prosperity or adversity.</note> event happeneth to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.15'>Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth vnto me, as it befalleth to ye foole. Why therefore doe I then labour to be more wise? And I sayd in mine heart, that this also is vanitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.16'>For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool <note>Meaning, in this world.</note> for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And <note>He wonders that men forget a wise man, being dead, as soon as they do a fool.</note> how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.17'>Therefore I hated life: for the worke that is wrought vnder the sunne is grieuous vnto me: for all is vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.18'>I hated also all my labour, wherein I had trauailed vnder the sunne, which I shall leaue to the man that shalbe after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.19'>And who knoweth whether he shalbe wise or foolish? yet shall hee haue rule ouer all my labour, wherein I haue trauailed, and wherein I haue shewed my selfe wise vnder the sunne. This is also vanitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.20'>Therefore I went about to cause my heart <note>That I might seek the true happiness which is in God.</note> to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.21'>For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured in it shall he <note>Among other griefs that was not the least, to leave that which he had gotten by great travail, to one who had taken no pain therefore and whom he know not whether he were a wise man or a fool.</note> leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.22'>For what hath man of all his trauaile and griefe of his heart, wherein he hath trauailed vnder the sunne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.23'>For all his dayes are sorowes, and his trauaile griefe: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.24'>[There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should <note>When man has all laboured, he can get no more than food and refreshing, yet he confesses also that this comes from God's blessing, as in (Ecc_3:13).</note> make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.25'>For who can eat, or who else can hasten <note>Meaning, to pleasures.</note> [to it], more than I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.2.26'>Surely to a man that is good in his sight, God giueth wisdome, and knowledge, and ioy: but to the sinner he giueth paine, to gather, and to heape to giue to him that is good before God: this is also vanitie, and vexation of the spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eccl.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.1'>To every [thing there is] a <note>He speaks of this diversity of time for two causes first to declare that there is nothing in this world perpetual: next to teach us not to be grieved, if we have not all things at once according to our desires, neither enjoy them so long as we would wish.</note> season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.2'>A time to bee borne, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.3'>A time to slay, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to builde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.4'>A time to weepe, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.5'>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones: a time to embrace, and a time to be farre from embracing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.6'>A time to seeke, and a time to lose: a time to keepe, and a time to cast away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.7'>A time to rent, and a time to sowe: a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.8'>A time to loue, and a time to hate: a time of warre, and a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.9'>What profite hath hee that worketh of the thing wherein he trauaileth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.10'>I have seen the labour, which God hath given to the sons of men <note>Read (Ecc_1:13).</note> to be exercised in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.11'>He hath made every [thing] beautiful in its time: also he hath set the <note>God has given man a desire and affection to seek out the things of this world, and to labour in it.</note> world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.12'>I know that there is nothing good in them, but to reioyce, and to doe good in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.13'>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the <note>Read (Ecc_2:24) and these places declare that we should do all things with sobriety and in the fear of God, as he gives not his gifts to the intent that they should be abused.</note> gift of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.14'>I know that, whatever God doeth, it shall be for <note>That is, man will never be able to prevent God's work, but as he has determined so it will come to pass.</note> ever: nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.15'>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God <note>God only causes what which is past, to return.</note> requireth that which is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.16'>And moreouer I haue seene vnder the sunne the place of iudgement, where was wickednesse, and the place of iustice where was iniquitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.17'>I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time <note>Meaning, with God, however man neglects his duty.</note> there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.18'>I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men, that God might <note>And made them pure in their first creation.</note> tempt them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.19'>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing <note>Man is not able by his reason and judgment to put differences between man and beast, as concerning those things to which both are subject: for the eye cannot judge any otherwise of a man being dead than of a beast, which is dead: yet by the word of God and faith we easily know the diversity as in (Ecc_3:21).</note> befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.20'>All goe to one place, &amp; all was of the dust, and all shall returne to the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.21'>Who <note>Meaning, that reason cannot comprehend that which faith believes in.</note> knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.3.22'>Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should <note>By the often repetition of this sentence as in (Ecc_2:24, Ecc_3:12, Ecc_3:22, Ecc_5:17, Ecc_8:15) he declares that man by reason can comprehend nothing better in this life than to use the gifts of God soberly and comfortably: for to know further, is a special gift of God revealed by his Spirit.</note> rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Eccl.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.1'>So <note>He makes here another discourse with himself concerning the tyranny of them that oppressed the poor.</note> I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.2'>Wherefore I praised the <note>Because they are no longer subject to these oppressions.</note> dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.4'>Again, I considered all labour, and every <note>The more perfect that the work is, the more it is envied by the wicked.</note> right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.5'>The fool foldeth his hands together, and <note>For idleness he is compelled to destroy himself.</note> eateth his own flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.6'>Better is an handfull with quietnesse, then two handfuls with labour and vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.7'>Againe I returned, and sawe vanitie vnder the sunne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.8'>There is one alone, &amp; there is not a second, which hath neither sonne nor brother, yet is there none end of all his trauaile, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither doeth he thinke, For whome doe I trauaile and defraude my soule of pleasure? this also is vanitie, and this is an euill trauaile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.9'>
          <note>As when man is alone, he can neither help himself nor others, he shows that men should live in mutual society to the intent that they may be profitable one to another, and that their things may increase.</note>Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.4.10'>For if they fal, the one wil lift vp his felow: but wo vnto him that is alone: for he falleth, and there is not a second to lift him vp.</verse>
