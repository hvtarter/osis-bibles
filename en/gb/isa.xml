      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The <note>That is, a revelation or prophecy, which was one of the two means by which God declared himself to his servants in old times, as in (Num_12:6) and therefore the prophets were called seers, (1Sa_9:9).</note> vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw <note>Isaiah was chiefly sent to Judah and Jerusalem, but not only: for in this book are prophecies concerning other nations also.</note> concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of <note>Called also Azariah, (2Ki_15:1) of these kings read (2Ki. 14:1-21:1; 2Ch. 25:1-33:1).</note> Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <note>The Argument - God, according to his promise in (Deu_18:15) that he would never leave his Church destitute of a prophet, has from time to time accomplished the same: whose office was not only to declare to the people the things to come, of which they had a special revelation, but also to interpret and declare the law, and to apply particularly the doctrine contained briefly in it, for the use and profit of those to whom they thought it chiefly to belong, and as the time and state of things required. Principally in the declaration of the law, they had respect to three things which were the ground of their doctrine: first, to the doctrine contained briefly in the two tables: secondly to the promises and threatenings of the law: and thirdly to the covenant of grace and reconciliation grounded on our Saviour Jesus Christ, who is the end of the law. To which they neither added nor diminished, but faithfully expounded the sense and meaning of it. As God gave them understanding of things, they applied the promises particularly for the comfort of the Church and the members of it, and also denounced the menaces against the enemies of the same: not for any care or regard to the enemies, but to assure the Church of their safeguard by the destruction of their enemies. Concerning the doctrine of reconciliation, they have more clearly entreated it than Moses, and set forth more lively Jesus Christ, in whom this covenant of reconciliation was made. In all these things Isaiah surpassed all the prophets, and was diligent to set out the same, with vehement admonitions, reprehensions, and consolations: ever applying the doctrine as he saw that the disease of the people required. He declares also many notable prophecies which he had received from God, concerning the promise of the Messiah, his office and kingdom, the favour of God toward his Church, the calling of the Gentiles and their union with the Jews. Which are principal points contained in this book, and a gathering of his sermons that he preached. Which after certain days that they had stood upon the temple door (for the manner of the prophets was to post the sum of their doctrine for certain days, that the people might the better mark it as in (Isa_8:1; Hab_2:2)) the priests took it down and reserved it among their registers. By God's providence these books were preserved as a monument to the Church forever. Concerning his person and time he was of the king's stock (for Amos his father was brother to Azariah king of Judah, as the best writers agree) and prophesied more than 64 years, from the time of Uzziah to the reign of Manasseh who was his son-in-law (as the Hebrews write) and by whom he was put to death. In reading of the prophets, this one thing among others is to be observed, that they speak of things to come as though they were now past because of the certainty of it, and that they could not but come to pass, because God had ordained them in his secret counsel and so revealed them to his prophets.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O <note>Because men were obstinate and insensible, he calls to the dumb creatures, who were more prompt to obey God's word, as in (Deu_32:1).</note> heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up <note>He declares his great mercy toward the Jews as he chose them above all other nations to be his people and children as in (Deu_10:15).</note> children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose [is] the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I <note>Although God commanded these sacrifices for a time, as aids and exercises of their faith, yet because the people did not have faith or repentance, God detests them, (Psa_50:13; Jer_6:20; Amo_5:22; Mic_6:7).</note> delight not in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>
          <note>Without faith and repentance.</note>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure; [it is] iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your <note>Your sacrifices offered in the new moons and feasts: he condemns by this hypocrites who think to please God with ceremonies and they themselves are void of faith and mercy.</note> new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing [them].</verse>

          <note>By this outward washing, he means the spiritual: exhorting the Jews to repent and amend their lives.</note>Wash ye, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to <note>This kind of reasoning by the second table, the scriptures use in many places against the hypocrites who pretend holiness and religion in word, but when charity and love for their brethren should appear they declare that they have neither faith nor religion.</note> do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, <note>To know if I accuse you without cause.</note> and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be <note>Lest sinners should pretend any rigour on God's part, he only wills them to be pure in heart, and he will forgive all their sins, no matter how many or great.</note> white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
