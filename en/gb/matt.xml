        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>And al this was done that it might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by ye Prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a <note>There is an article added in the Hebrew and Greek text, to point out the woman and set her forth plainly: as we would say, the virgin, or a certain virgin.</note> virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as the Angel of the Lorde had inioyned him, and tooke his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>And knew her not <note>The word «till», in the Hebrew language, gives us to understand that a thing will not come to pass in time to come: as Michal had no children «till» her death day, (2Sa_6:23).

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when <note>Christ a poor child, laid down in a crib, and though given no attention by his own people, receives nonetheless a noble witness of his divinity from heaven, and of his kingly estate from strangers: which his own people unknowingly let happen, although they did not acknowledge him.</note> Jesus was born in Bethlehem of <note>For there was another in the tribe of Zebulun.</note> Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came <note>Wise and learned men: It is a Persian word which they use frequently.</note> wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Saying, Where is that King of the Iewes that is borne? For wee haue seene his starre in the East, and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was <note>Was much moved, for he was a foreigner, and became ruler by force; and the Jews were troubled; for wickedness is mad and raging.</note> troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the <note>The chief priests, that is, such as were of Aaron's family, who were divided into twenty-four orders. (1Ch_24:5; 2Ch_36:14).</note> chief priests and <note>They that expound the law to the people, for the Hebrews take this word for another, which means as much as to expound and to declare.</note> scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they saide vnto him, At Beth-leem in Iudea: for so it is written by the Prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Juda, art not the <note>Though you are a small town, yet you will be very famous and notable through the birth of the Messiah, who will be born in you.</note> least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that <note>That will rule and govern: for kings are rightly called leaders and shepherds of the people.</note> shall rule my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod priuily called the Wisemen, and diligently inquired of them the time of the starre that appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sent them to Beth-leem, saying, Goe, and searche diligently for the babe: and when ye haue founde him, bring mee worde againe, that I may come also, and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>So when they had heard the King, they departed: and loe, the starre which they had seene in the East, went before them, till it came and stoode ouer the place where the babe was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they sawe the starre, they reioyced with an exceeding great ioy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and <note>A kind of humble and lovely reverence.</note> fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their <note>The rich and costly presents, which they brought him.</note> treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being <note>God warned and told them of it, even though they did not ask him.</note> warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>
          <note>Christ having just been born, begins to be crucified for us, both in himself, and also in his members.</note>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So he arose and tooke the babe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And was there vnto the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the Wisemen, was exceeding wroth, and sent foorth, and slew all the male children that were in Beth-leem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two yeere old and vnder, according to the time which he had diligently searched out of the Wisemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken <note>For God speaketh by the mouth of the prophets.</note> by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>In Rama was there <note>A voice of lamenting, weeping and howling.</note> a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, <note>That is to say, All who live around Bethlehem: for Rachel, Jacob's wife who died in childbirth, was buried by the road that leads to this town, which is also called Ephratah, because of the fruitfulness of the soil, and the plentifulness of corn.</note> Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>
          <note>Christ is brought up in Nazareth, after the death of the tyrant by God's providence: that by the very name of the place it might plainly appear to the world that he is the Lord's true Nazarite.</note>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Saying, Arise, and take the babe and his mother, and goe into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the babes life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Then he arose vp and tooke the babe and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But whe he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in stead of his father Herod, he was afraide to go thither: yet after he was warned of God in a dreame, he turned aside into the parts of Galile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And went and dwelt in a citie called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, which was, That hee should be called a Nazarite.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In <note>Not when Joseph went to dwell at Nazareth, but a great while after, about fifteen years: for in the 30th year of his life Jesus was baptized by John: therefore «those days» means the time when Jesus remained as an inhabitant of the town of Nazareth.</note> those days came <note>John, who through his singular holiness and rare austerity of life caused men to cast their eyes on him, prepares the way for Christ who is following fast on his heels, as the prophet Isaiah foretold, and delivers the sum of the gospel, which a short time later would be delivered more fully.</note> John the Baptist, preaching in the <note>In a hilly country, which was nonetheless inhabited, for Zacharias dwelt there, (Luk_1:39-40), and there was Joab's house, (1Ki_2:34); and besides these, Joshua makes mention of six towns that were in the wilderness, (Jos_15:61-62).</note> wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying, <note>The word in the greek signifies a changing of our minds and heart from evil to better.</note> Repent ye: for the <note>The kingdom of Messiah, whose government will be heavenly, and nothing but heavenly.</note> kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, <note>Make him a plain and smooth way.</note> make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was <note>Locusts were a type of meat which certain of the eastern people use, who were therefore called devourers of locusts.</note> locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him <note>The people of Jerusalem.</note> Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized of him in Jordan, <note>Acknowledging that they were saved only by free remission and forgiveness of their sins.</note> confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>
          <note>There is nothing that shuts up the way of mercy and salvation from us so much as the opinion of our own righteousness does.</note>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>
          <note>True repentance is an inward thing which has its seat in the mind and heart.</note>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>
          <note>The faith of the fathers does not benefit you unbelieving children at all: and yet for all that, God does not play the liar, nor deal unfaithfully in his covenant which he made with the holy fathers.</note>And <note>Think not that you have any reason to be proud of Abraham.</note> think not to say <note>In your hearts.</note> within yourselves, We have Abraham to [our] father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now also is the axe put to the roote of the trees: therfore euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen downe, &amp; cast into ye fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>
          <note>We may neither dwell upon the signs which God has ordained as means to lead us into our salvation, neither upon those that minister them: but we must climb up to the matter itself, that is to say, to Christ, who inwardly works that effectually, which is outwardly signified to us.</note>I indeed baptize you with water unto <note>The outward sign reminds us of this, that we must change our lives and become better, assuring us as by a seal, that we are ingrafted into Christ; by which our old man dies and the new man rises up; (Rom_6:4).</note> repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and [with] fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>
          <note>The triumphs of the wicked will end in everlasting torment.</note>Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will throughly <note>Will clean it thoroughly, and make a full riddance.</note> purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>
          <note>Christ sanctified our baptism in himself.</note>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But Iohn earnestly put him backe, saying, I haue neede to be baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil <note>All such things as it has appointed for us to keep.</note> all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto <note>To John.</note> him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>
          <note>Christ's full consecration and authorization to the office of mediator is shown by the Father's own voice and a visible sign of the Holy Spirit.</note>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am <note>The Greek word signifies a thing of great worth and such as highly pleases a man. So then the Father says that Christ is the only man whom when he beholds, looking at what opinion he had conceived of us, he lays it clean aside.</note> well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was <note>Christ is tempted in all manner of ways, and still overcomes, that we also through his virtue may overcome.</note> Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted <note>A full forty days.</note> forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>Then came to him the tempter, and said, If thou be the Sonne of God, commande that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not liue by bread onely, but by euery worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a <note>The battlement which encompassed the flat roof of the Temple so that no man might fall down: as was appointed by the law; (Deu_22:8).</note> pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: for it is written, that he wil giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with their hands they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not <note>Literally, «Thou shalt not go on still in tempting.»</note> tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Againe the deuil tooke him vp into an exceeding hie mountaine, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And sayd to him, All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe, and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then sayd Iesus vnto him, Auoyde Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the deuill left him: and beholde, the Angels came, and ministred vnto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>
          <note>When the Herald's mouth is stopped, the Lord reveals himself and brings full light into the darkness of this world, preaching free forgiveness of sins for those that repent.</note>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in <note>Which was a town a great deal more famous than Nazareth was.</note> Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Propet, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>
          <note>Christ, thinking that he would eventually depart from us, even at the beginning of his preaching gets himself disciples of a heavenly sort, poor and unlearned, and therefore such as might be left as honest witnesses of the truth of those things which they heard and saw.</note>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he sayd vnto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His <note>The beams of his eyes, and by the figure of speech called synecdoche, this is understood as the countenance.</note> countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for feare of him, the keepers were astonied, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not <note>The word «ye» is spoken with force to indicate that it was the women to whom he was speaking, as the soldiers were also afraid.</note> ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he is risen; as he saide: come, see the place where the Lord was laid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, &amp; tel his disciples that he is risen fro ye dead: &amp; behold, he goeth before you into Galile: there ye shall see him: loe, I haue told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>So they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioye, and did runne to bring his disciples worde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>
          <note>Christ himself appears after his resurrection, and sending the women to his disciples, shows that he has not forgotten them.</note>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Iesus vnto them, Be not afraide. Goe, and tell my brethren, that they goe into Galile, and there shall they see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>
          <note>The more that the sun shines, the more that the wicked are blinded.</note>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And they gathered them together with the Elders, and tooke counsell, and gaue large money vnto the souldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>

          <note>Christ appears also to his disciples, whom he makes apostles.</note>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>

          <note>The sum of the apostleship is the proclaiming of the doctrine received from Christ throughout all the world, and the ministering of the sacraments: the efficacy of which things depends not on the minsters but on the Lord.</note>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them <note>Calling upon the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</note> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you <note>Forever: and this refers to the manner of the presence of his Spirit, by means of which he makes us partakers both of himself and of all his benefits, even though he is absent from us in body.</note> alway, [even] unto the end of the world.
