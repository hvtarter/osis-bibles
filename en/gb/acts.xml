      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The <note>Luke switches over from the history of the Gospel, that is from the history of the sayings and doings of Christ, unto the Acts of the Apostles.</note> former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to <note>The acts of Jesus are the miracles and deeds which showed his Godhead, and his most perfect holiness, and examples of his doctrine.</note> do and teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>Vntill the day that hee was taken vp, after that hee through the holy Ghost, had giuen commaundements vnto the Apostles, whome hee had chosen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>
          <note>Christ did not immediately ascend into heaven after his resurrection in order to thoroughly prove his resurrection, and with his presence strengthen and encourage his Apostles in the doctrine which they had heard.</note>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many <note>He called those things infallible proofs which are otherwise termed necessary: now in that Christ spoke, and walked, and ate, and was felt by many, these are sure signs and proofs that he truly rose again.</note> infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And, being <note>They were dispersed here and there, but he gathers them together so that all of them might together be witnesses of his resurrection.</note> assembled together with [them], commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he], ye have heard of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized <note>Either by the Father, or by me: so that either the Father or Christ is set here contrasted with John, as the Holy Spirit is contrasted with water, as things that are comparable to one another.</note> with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>
          <note>We must fight before we triumph, and we must not search curiously after those things which God has not revealed.</note>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time <note>To the old and ancient state.</note> restore again the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the <note>That is, the proper occasions that provide opportunities for doing matters, which occasions the Lord has appointed to bring things to pass in.</note> seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But yee shall receiue power of the holy Ghost, when he shall come on you: and ye shalbe witnesses vnto me both in Hierusalem and in all Iudea, and in Samaria, and vnto the vttermost part of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>
          <note>After Christ had promised the full power of the Holy Spirit, with whom he would govern his church (even though he would be absent in body), he took up his body from us into heavenly tabernacles to remain there until the latter day of judgment, as the angels witness.</note>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they looked stedfastly towarde heauen, as hee went, beholde, two men stoode by them in white apparell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up <note>That is, out of your sight.</note> from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath <note>About two miles.</note> day's journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>
          <note>Ecclesiastical assemblies to hear the word, and to make common prayer, were first instituted and kept in private houses by the Apostles.</note>And when they were <note>They went into the house which the Church had chosen at that time to be a gathering place for the whole assembly.</note> come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas [the brother] of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all <note>The Greek word signifies an invincible constancy and steadfastness.</note> continued with <note>It is to good purpose that this agreement is mentioned: for those prayers are most acceptable to God which are made with agreeing minds and wills.</note> one accord in <note>The disciples prayed for the sending of the Holy Spirit, and also to be delivered from present dangers, of which there were many that they were experiencing.</note> prayer and supplication, with the <note>For it was appropriate to have the wives strengthened and encouraged who would afterwards be partakers of the dangers with their husbands.</note> women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his <note>With his relatives.</note> brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>
          <note>Peter is made the spokesman and interpreter of the whole company of the Apostles, either by secret revelation of the Holy Spirit, or by the express judgment of the congregation.</note>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of <note>Because men are commonly referred to and enrolled by their names.</note> names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>
          <note>Peter anticipates the offence that might be taken at the falling away of Judas the betrayer, showing that all things which happened to him were foretold by God.</note>Men [and] brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For hee was nombred with vs, and had obteined felowship in this ministration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Now this man <note>Luke did not consider Judas' purpose, but that which followed it, and so we used to say that a man has done himself harm, not that he wanted and intended to, but in respect of that which followed.</note> purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and <note>The Greek words signify this much, that Judas fell down flat and was torn apart in the middle, with a tremendously great noise.</note> falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it is knowen vnto all the inhabitants of Hierusalem, in so much, that that field is called in their owne language, Aceldama, That is, the field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his <note>His office and ministry: David wrote these words against Doeg the King's herdsman: and these words «shepherd», «sheep», and «flock» are used with reference to the Church office and ministry, so that the Church and the offices are called by these names.</note> bishoprick let another take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>
          <note>The Apostles do not deliberate at all, but first they consult and take guidance from God's word: and again they do nothing that concerns and is incumbent upon the whole body of the congregation, without making the congregation a part of the decision.</note>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus <note>This kind of speech signifies as much in the Hebrew language as the exercising of a public and difficult office, when they speak of such as are in any public office; (Deu_31:2; 1Ch_27:1).</note> went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up <note>From our company.</note> from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>
          <note>The Apostles must be chosen immediately from God: and therefore after praying, Matthias is chose by lot, which is as it were God's own voice.</note>And they <note>Openly, and by the voices of the entire company.</note> appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they praied, saying, Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>That he may take <note>That he may be a member and partaker of this ministry.</note> part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression <note>Departed from, or fallen from: and it is a metaphor taken from the word «way»: for callings are signified by the name of «ways» with the Hebrews.</note> fell, that he might go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they gaue foorth their lottes: and the lotte fell on Matthias, and hee was by a common consent counted with the eleuen Apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And <note>The Apostles being gathered together on a most solemn feast day in one place, that it might evidently appear to all the world that they all had one office, one Spirit, and one faith, are by a double sign from heaven authorised, and anointed with all the most excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit, and especially with an extraordinary and necessary gift of tongues.</note> when the day of Pentecost was <note>Literally, «was fulfilled»: that is, was begun, as in (Luk_2:21). For the Hebrews say that a day or a year is fulfilled or ended when the former days or years are ended, and the other has begun; (Jer_25:12): «And it will come to pass that when seventy years are fulfilled, I will visit, etc.» For the Lord did not bring his people home after the seventieth year was ended, but in the seventieth year: Now the day of Pentecost was the fiftieth day after the feast of the Passover.</note> fully come, they were <note>The twelve apostles, who were to be the patriarchs as it were of the Church.</note> all with one accord in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly there came a sounde from heauen, as of a russhing and mightie winde, and it filled all the house where they sate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared vnto them clouen tongues, like fire, and it sate vpon eche of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with <note>He calls them «other tongues» which were not the same as the apostles commonly used, and Mark calls them «new tongues».</note> other tongues, as the <note>By this we understand that the apostles were not speaking one language and then another by chance at random, or as eccentric men used to do, but that they kept in mind the languages of their hearers: and to be short, that they only spoke as the Holy Spirit directed them to speak.</note> Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>And there were dwelling at Hierusalem Iewes, men that feared God, of euery nation vnder heauen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>Nowe when this was noised, the multitude came together and were astonied, because that euery man heard them speake his owne language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they wondered al, and marueiled, saying among themselues, Beholde, are not all these which speake, of Galile?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>
          <note>Not that they spoke one language, and different languages were heard, but the apostles spoke with different languages: for otherwise the miracle would have been in the hearers, whereas it is really in the speakers; Nazianzen in his oration of Whitsunday.</note>And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, &amp; Elamites, and the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and of Iudea, and of Cappadocia, of Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, <note>By Jews he means those that were both Jews by birth and Jews by profession of religion, though they were born in other places: and these latter ones were proselytes, who were born Gentiles, and embraced the Jewish religion.</note> Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Creetes, and Arabians: wee hearde them speake in our owne tongues the wonderful works of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>
          <note>God's word pierces some in such a way that it drives them to seek out the truth, and it so chokes others that it forces them to be witnesses of their own impudency.</note>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Others <note>The word which he uses here signifies a kind of mocking which is reproachful and insolent: and by this reproachful mocking we see that no matter how great and excellent the miracle, the wickedness of man still dares to speak evil against it.</note> mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, <note>The holiness of Peter is to be marked, in which the grace of the Holy Spirit is to be seen, even from the very beginning.</note> lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all [ye] that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the <note>After the sunrise, which may be about seven or eight o'clock to us.</note> third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which was spoken by the <note>There is nothing that can dissolve questions and doubt except testimony taken out of the Prophets: for men's reasonings may be overturned, but God's voice cannot be overturned.</note> prophet Joel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>
          <note>Peter setting forth the truth of God against the false accusations of men, shows in himself and in his companions that the prophecy of Joel concerning the full giving of the Holy Spirit in the latter days has been fulfilled: and this grace is also offered to the whole Church, to the certain and undoubted destruction of those who condemn it.</note>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon <note>All without exception, both upon the Jews and Gentiles.</note> all <note>That is, men.</note> flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And on my seruauntes, and on mine handmaides I will powre out of my Spirite in those daies, and they shall prophecie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I wil shew wonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and the vapour of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The Sunne shalbe turned into darkenesse, and the moone into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>
          <note>The most important use of all the gifts of the Holy Spirit is to bring men to salvation by faith.</note>And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall <note>These words «call on» signify in Holy Scriptures and earnest praying and craving for help from God's hand.</note> call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>
          <note>Christ, being innocent, was by God's providence crucified by wicked men.</note>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man <note>Who is by those works which God did by him so manifestly approved and admitted of, that no man can deny him.</note> approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and <note>God's everlasting foreknowledge, which can neither be separated from his determinate counsel, as the Epicureans say, neither yet be the cause of evil: for God in his everlasting and unchangeable counsel appointed the wicked act of Judas to an excellent end: and God does that well which the instrument does wickedly.</note> foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked <note>God's counsel does not excuse the Jews, whose hands were wicked.</note> hands have crucified and <note>The fact is said to be theirs by whose counsel and urging on it is done.</note> slain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>
          <note>As David foretold, Christ did not only rise again, but also was void of all decay in the grave.</note>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the <note>The death that was full of sorrow both of body and mind: therefore when death appeared conqueror and victor over those sorrows, Christ is rightly said to have overcome those sorrows of death when, as being dead, he overcame death, to live forever with his Father.</note> pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For Dauid sayeth concerning him, I beheld the Lorde alwaies before me: for hee is at my right hand, that l should not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore did mine heart reioyce, and my tongue was glad, and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>Because thou wilt not <note>You will not allow me to remain in the grave.</note> leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast <note>You have opened to me the way of true life.</note> made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men and brethren, I may boldly speake vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid, that hee is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre remaineth with vs vnto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had <note>Had sworn solemnly.</note> sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>Hee knowing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soule shoulde not bee left in graue, neither his flesh shoulde see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>
          <note>Peter witnesses that Jesus Christ is the appointed everlasting King, which he manifestly proves by the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the testimony of David.</note>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore being by the <note>Might and power of God.</note> right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For Dauid is not ascended into heauen, but he sayth, The Lord sayd to my Lorde, Sit at my right hande,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath <note>Christ is said to be «made» because he was advanced to that dignity, and therefore it is not spoken with reference to his nature, but with reference to his position and high dignity.</note> made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now when they heard it, they were pricked in their heartes, and said vnto Peter and the other Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we doe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>
          <note>Repentance and remission of sins in Christ are two principles of the Gospel and therefore of our salvation: and they are obtained by the promises apprehended by faith, and are ratified by us in baptism; and with our salvation comes the power of the Holy Spirit (Ed.).</note>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the <note>The word that is used here shows us that it was a free gift.</note> promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, [even] as many as the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>
          <note>He is truly joined to the Church who separates himself from the wicked.</note>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>
          <note>A notable example of the power of the Holy Spirit: but such are not baptized until they make confession of their faith. (Ed.)</note>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added [unto them] about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>
          <note>The marks of the true Church are the doctrine of the apostles, the duties of charity, the pure and simple administration of the ordinances, and the true invocation used by all of the faithful.</note>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and <note>Sharing of goods, and all other duties of charity, as is shown afterwards.</note> fellowship, and in <note>The Jews used thin loaves, and therefore they broke them rather than cut them: so by breaking of bread they meant living together, and the banquets which they used to keep. And when they kept their love feasts, they used to celebrate the Lord's supper, which even in those days began to be corrupted, and Paul corrects this in (1Co. 11:17-34).</note> breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>
          <note>As often as the Lord thinks it to be expedient, he bridles the rage of strangers, so that the Church may be planted and have some refreshing.</note>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>
          <note>Charity makes all things common with regard to their use, according as necessity requires.</note>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all me, as euery one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>
          <note>The faithful came together at the beginning with tremendous results, not only for the hearing of the word, but also to eat.</note>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>Praysing God, and had fauour with all the people: and the Lorde added to the Church from day to day, such as should be saued.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now <note>Christ, in healing a man that was born lame and well known to all men, both in a famous place and at a popular time, by the hands of his apostles partly strengthens and encourages those who believed, and partly also calls others to believe.</note> Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, [being] the ninth [hour].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certaine ma which was a creeple fro his mothers wombe, was caried, whom they layde dayly at the gate of the Temple called Beautifull, to aske almes of them that entred into ye Temple.</verse>

          <note>Although Paul was a captive, yet the power of God was not captive.</note>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And when we arriued at Syracuse, we taried there three dayes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>And from thence we set a compasse, and came to Rhegium: and after one day, the South wind blewe, and we came the seconde day to Putioli:</verse>

          <note>God never allows his own to be afflicted beyond their strength.</note>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as <note>Appius was a paved road made by Appius the blind, with the help of his soldiers, long and broad, and it ran out towards the sea, and there were three taverns on it.</note> Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>

          <note>Paul in every place remembers himself to be an apostle.</note>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>Who when they had examined me, would haue let me goe, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>

          <note>We may use the means which God gives us, but in such a way that we seek the glory of God, and not of ourselves.</note>But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</verse>

          <note>The Law and the Gospel agree well together.</note>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and <note>With good reasons, and proved that the kingdom of God foretold to them by the Prophets had come.</note> testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>

          <note>The Gospel is a taste of life to those that believe, and a taste of death to those that are disobedient.</note>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>Therefore when they agreed not among themselues, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, to wit, Well spake the holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet vnto our fathers,</verse>

          <note>The unbelievers willingly resist the truth, and yet not by chance.</note>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</verse>
