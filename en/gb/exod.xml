      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now <note>Moses describes the wonderful order that God observes in performing his promise to Abraham; (Gen_15:14).</note> these [are] the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. <note>The Argument - After Jacob by God's commandment in (Gen_46:3) had brought his family into Egypt, where they remained for four hundred years, and from seventy people grew to an infinite number so that the king and the country endeavoured both by tyranny and cruel slavery to suppress them: the Lord according to his promise in (Gen_15:14) had compassion on his Church, and delivered them, but plagued their enemies in most strange and varied ways. The more the tyranny of the wicked raged against his Church, the more his heavy judgments increased against them, till Pharaoh and his army were drowned in the sea, which gave an entry and passage to the children of God. As the ingratitude of man is great, so they immediately forgot God's wonderful benefits and although he had given them the Passover as a sign and memorial of the same, yet they fell to distrust, and tempted God with various complaining and grudging against him and his ministers: sometimes out of ambition, sometimes lack of drink or meat to satisfy their lusts, sometimes idolatry, or such like. For this reason, God punished them with severe rods and plagues, that by his correction they might turn to him for help against his scourges, and earnestly repent for their rebellion and wickedness. Because God loves them to the end, whom he has once begun to love, he punished them not as they deserved, but dealt with them mercifully, and with new benefits laboured to overcome their malice: for he still governed them and gave them his word and Law, both concerning the way to serve him, and also the form of judgments and civil policy: with the intent that they would not serve God after as they pleased, but according to the order, that his heavenly wisdom had appointed.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Leui, and Iudah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Beniamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>So al the soules, that came out of the loines of Iaakob, were seuentie soules: Ioseph was in Egypt already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>Nowe Ioseph died and all his brethren, and that whole generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the <note>He means the country of Goshen.</note> land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which <note>He did not consider how God had preserved Egypt for the sake of Joseph.</note> knew not Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he sayde vnto his people, Beholde, the people of the children of Israel are greater and mightier then we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and [so] <note>Into Canaan, and so we shall lose our conveniences.</note> get them up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore did they set taskemasters ouer them, to keepe the vnder with burdens: and they built the cities Pithom and Raamses for the treasures of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And <note>The more God blesses his own, the more the wicked envy them.</note> they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>Wherefore the Egyptians by crueltie caused the children of Israel to serue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>Thus they made them weary of their liues by sore labour in clay &amp; in bricke, &amp; in al worke in the fielde, with all maner of bondage, which they layde vpon them most cruelly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one [was] <note>These seem to have been the main of the rest.</note> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>And sayde, When ye doe the office of a midwife to the women of the Ebrewes, and see them on their stooles, if it be a sonne, then yee shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then let her liue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>Notwithstanding ye midwiues feared God, and did not as the King of Egypt commaunded them, but preserued aliue the men children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>Then the King of Egypt called for the midwiues, and sayde vnto them, Why haue yee done thus, and haue preserued aliue the men children?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew <note>Their disobedience in this was lawful, but their deception is evil.</note> women [are] not as the Egyptian women; for they [are] lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>God therefore prospered the midwiues, and the people multiplied and were very mightie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he <note>That is, God increased the families of the Israelites by their means.</note> made them houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall <note>When tyrants cannot prevail by deceit, they burst into open rage.</note> cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a <note>This Levite was called Amram, who married Jochebed in (Exo_6:20).</note> man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman coceiued and bare a sonne: and when she saw that he was faire, she hid him three moneths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and <note>Committing him to the providence of God, whom she could not keep from the rage of the tyrant.</note> put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>Now his sister stood a farre off, to wit what would come of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>Then ye daughter of Pharaoh came downe to wash her in the riuer, and her maidens walked by the riuers side: and when shee sawe the arke among the bulrushes, she sent her maide to fet it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>Then she opened it, and sawe it was a childe: and beholde, the babe wept: so she had compassion on it, and sayde, This is one of the Ebrewes children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then said his sister vnto Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and cal vnto thee a nurce of the Ebrew women to nurce thee the childe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the <note>Man's counsel cannot hinder that which God has determined shall come to pass.</note> child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>To whome Pharaohs daughter sayde, Take this childe away, and nurce it for me, and I wil reward thee. Then the woman tooke the childe and nurced him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>Nowe the childe grewe, and she brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter, and he was as her sonne, and she called his name Moses, because, said she, I drewe him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was <note>That is, was forty years old; (Act_7:23).</note> grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he <note>Being assured that God had appointed him to deliver the Israelites; (Act_7:25).</note> slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>Againe he came forth the second day, and behold, two Ebrewes stroue: and he said vnto him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellowe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses <note>Though by his fear he showed his weakness, yet faith covered it; (Heb_11:27).</note> feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>Now Pharaoh heard this matter, &amp; sought to slay Moses: therefore Moses fled from Pharaoh, and dwelt in the lande of Midian, and hee sate downe by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>And the Priest of Midian had seue daughters, which came and drewe water, and filled the troghes, for to water their fathers sheepe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>Then the shepherds came and droue them away: but Moses rose vp and defended them, and watered their sheepe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And whe they came to Reuel their father, he said, Howe are ye come so soone to day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they saide, A man of Egypt deliuered vs from the hand of the shepherdes, and also drew vs water ynough, and watered the sheepe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? <note>In which he demonstrated a thankful mind, which would reward the good done to his.</note> call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses agreed to dwell with the man: who gaue vnto Moses Zipporah his daughter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bare a sonne, whose name he called Gershom: for he said, I haue bene a stranger in a strange lande.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they <note>God humbles his by afflictions, that they should cry to him, and receive the fruit of his promise.</note> cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>Then God heard their mone, and God remembred his couenant with Abraham, Izhak, and Iaakob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had <note>He judges their causes or acknowledged them as his own.</note> respect unto [them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the <note>It was so called after the law was given.</note> mountain of God, [even] to <note>Called also Sinai.</note> Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a <note>This shows that the Church is not consumed by the fires of affliction, because God is in the midst of it.</note> bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>Therefore Moses saide, I will turne aside nowe, and see this great sight, why the bush burneth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when the <note>Whom he calls the angel in (Exo_3:2).</note> LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: <note>Resign yourself to me; (Rth_4:7; Jos_5:15).</note> put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] <note>Because of my presence.</note> holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>Moreover he said, I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was <note>For sin causes man to fear God's justice.</note> afraid to look upon God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which [are] in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their <note>Whose cruelty was intolerable.</note> taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land <note>Most plentiful of all things.</note> flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>
          <note>He heard before, but now he would avenge it.</note>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Come now therefore, and I will send thee vnto Pharaoh, that thou maiest bring my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said unto God, Who [am] <note>He does not fully disobey God, but acknowledges his own weakness.</note> I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, <note>Neither fear your own weakness, or Pharaoh's tyranny.</note> Certainly I will be with thee; and this [shall be] a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>Then Moses said vnto God, Behold, when I shall come vnto the children of Israel, and shall say vnto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me vnto you: if they say vnto me, What is his Name? What shall I say vnto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said unto Moses, I <note>The God who has always been, am, and shall be: the God almighty, by whom all things have their being, and the God of mercy, mindful of my promise.</note> AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God spake further vnto Moses, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel, The Lorde God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Izhak, and the God of Iaakob hath sent me vnto you: this is my Name for euer, and this is my memoriall vnto all ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go &amp; gather the Elders of Israel together, &amp; thou shalt say vnto the, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Izhak, &amp; Iaakob appeared vnto me, &amp; said, I haue surely remembred you, &amp; that which is done to you in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>Therefore I did say, I wil bring you out of the affliction of Egypt vnto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, vnto a lande that floweth with milke and honie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may <note>Because Egypt was full of idolatry, God would appoint them a place where they could serve him purely.</note> sacrifice to the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>But I know, that the King of Egypt wil not let you goe, but by strong hande.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>Therefore will I stretch out mine hande and smite Egypt with all my wonders, which I will doe in the middes thereof: and after that shall he let you goe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will make this people to be fauoured of the Egyptians: so that when ye go, ye shal not goe emptie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>
          <note>This example may not be followed generally: though at God's commandment they did it justly, receiving some recompence for their labours.</note>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put [them] upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, <note>God bears with Moses doubting, because he was not completely without faith.</note> But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And the Lord said vnto him, What is that in thine hande? And he answered, A rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>Then said he, Cast it on the ground. So he cast it on the grounde, and it was turned into a serpent: and Moses fled from it.</verse>

          <note>This power to work miracles was to confirm his doctrine, and to assure him of his vocation.</note>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</verse>
