      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, <note>See the declaration of such salutations in the former epistles.</note> an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace be with you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>
          <note>He begins after this manner with thanksgiving, which nonetheless (otherwise than he was accustomed to) he applies to himself: beginning his epistle with the setting forth of the dignity of his apostleship, forced (as it should seem) by their importunity which took an occasion to despise him, by reason of his miseries. But he answers, that he is not so afflicted but that his comforts do exceed his afflictions, showing the ground of them, even the mercy of God the Father in Jesus Christ.</note>
          <note>To him be praise and glory given.</note>Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of <note>Most merciful.</note> mercies, and the God of all comfort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, <note>The Lord comforts us to this end and purpose, that we may so much the more surely comfort others.</note> that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the <note>The miseries which we suffer for Christ, or which Christ suffers in us.</note> sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>
          <note>He denies that either his afflictions with which he was often afflicted, or the consolations which he received of God, may justly be despised, seeing that the Corinthians both ought and might take great occasion to be strengthened and encouraged by either of them.</note>And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is <note>Although salvation is given to us freely, yet because there is a way appointed to us by which we must come to it, which is the race of an innocent and upright life which we must run, therefore we are said to work our salvation; (Phi_2:12). And because it is God alone that of his free good will works all things in us, therefore is he said to work the salvation in us by that very same way by which we must pass to everlasting life, after we have once overcome all incumbrances.</note> effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope is stedfast concerning you, in as much as we know that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>
          <note>He witnesses that he is not ashamed of his afflictions, and further that he desires also to have all men know the greatness of them, and also his delivery from them, although it is not yet perfect.</note>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we <note>I did not know at all what to do, neither did I see by man's help which way to save my life.</note> despaired even of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But we had the sentence of death in <note>I was resolved within myself to die.</note> ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who delivered us from so <note>From these great dangers.</note> great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>
          <note>That he may not seem to boast of himself, he attributes all to God, and in so doing also confesses that he attributes much to the prayers of the faithful.</note>Ye also helping together by prayer for us, <note>The end of the afflictions of the saints is the glory of God, and therefore they ought to be precious to us.</note> that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>
          <note>Secondly, he dismisses another slander, that is, that he was a light man, and such a one as was not lightly to be trusted, seeing that he promised to come to them, and did not come. And first he speaks of the singleness of his mind, and sincerity, which they knew both by his voice when he was present, and they ought to acknowledge it also in his letters, being absent: and moreover he protests that he will never be otherwise.</note>For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly <note>With clearness, and holy and true plainness of mind, as God himself can witness.</note> sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the <note>Trusting to that very wisdom which God of his free goodness has given me from heaven.</note> grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write <note>He says that he writes plainly and simply: for he that writes in an elaborate way, is rightly said to write otherwise than we read. And this, he says, the Corinthians will truly know and like very well.</note> none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the <note>Perfectly.</note> end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your <note>Paul's rejoicing in the Lord was that he had won the Corinthians: and they themselves rejoiced that such an apostle was their instructor, and taught them so purely and sincerely.</note> rejoicing, even as ye also [are] ours in the <note>When he will sit as judge.</note> day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a <note>Another benefit.</note> second benefit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>And to passe by you into Macedonia, and to come againe out of Macedonia vnto you, and to be led foorth towarde Iudea of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>
          <note>He dismisses their slander and false report by denying it, and first of all in that different ones went about to persuade the Corinthians, that in the preaching of the Gospel, Paul agreed not to himself: for this was the matter and the case.</note>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the <note>As men do who will rashly promise anything, and change their purpose constantly.</note> flesh, that with me there should be <note>That I should say and not say a thing?</note> yea yea, and nay nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>
          <note>He calls God as witness and as judge of his constancy in preaching and teaching one self same Gospel.</note>But [as] God [is] <note>True, and of whose faithful witness it would be horribly wicked to doubt.</note> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>
          <note>He adds also with himself his companions, as witnesses with whom he fully consented in teaching the same thing, that is, the same Christ.</note>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, <note>Was not different and wavering.</note> was not yea and nay, but in <note>That is, in God.</note> him was yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>
          <note>Last of all he declares the sum of his doctrine, that is, that all the promises of salvation are sure and ratified in Christ.</note>For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in <note>Christ is set also forth to exhibit and fulfil them most assuredly, and without any doubt.</note> him Amen, unto the glory of God by <note>Through our ministry.</note> us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>
          <note>He attributes the praise of this constancy only to the grace of God, through the Holy Spirit. In addition he concludes that they cannot doubt of his faith and his fellows, without doing injury to the Spirit of God, seeing that they themselves know all this to be true.</note>Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>Who hath also sealed us, and given the <note>An earnest is whatever is given to confirm a promise.</note> earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>
          <note>Now coming to the matter, he swears that he did not lightly alter his purpose of coming to them, but rather that he did not come to them for this reason, that he, being present, might not be forced to deal more sharply with them than he would like.</note>Moreover I call God for a record upon my <note>Against myself, and to the danger of my own life.</note> soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>
          <note>He removes all suspicion of arrogance, declaring that he speaks not as a lord to them, but as a servant, appointed by God to comfort them.</note>Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your <note>He sets the joy and peace of conscience, which God is author of, as opposed to tyrannous fear, and in addition shows the result of the Gospel.</note> joy: for by faith ye stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in <note>Causing grief among you, which he would have done if he had come to them before they had repented.</note> heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorie, who is he then that shoulde make me glad, but ye same which is made sorie by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having <note>For I trusted that you would immediately take that out of the way which you knew I was discontented with, considering how you are persuaded that my joy is your joy.</note> confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For in great affliction, &amp; anguish of heart I wrote vnto you with many teares: not that yee should be made sorie, but that ye might perceiue the loue which I haue, specially vnto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>
          <note>He passes to another part of this epistle: which nonetheless is put among the first, and to which he returns afterwards: and he handles the releasing and unloosing of the incestuous person, because he seemed to have been given sufficient testimony of his repentance. And this shows the true use of excommunication, that is, that it proceeds not from hatred, but from love, and so end, lest if we keep it up, we serve Satan the devil.</note>But if any have caused grief, he hath not <note>As if he said, «All that sorrow is so completely wiped away, that I have never felt it.»</note> grieved me, but <note>As for me, says Paul, I have no more to do with him.</note> in part: that I may not <note>Lest I should overcharge him who is burdened enough as it is, which burden I would be glad if it were taken from him.</note> overcharge you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>It is sufficient vnto the same man, that hee was rebuked of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to <note>That whereas before you punished him sharply, you should now forgive him.</note> forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would <note>That at my entreaty you would declare by the consent of the whole church, that you take him again as a brother.</note> confirm [your] love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For this cause also did I write, that I might knowe the proofe of you, whether yee would be obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the <note>Truly, and from the heart.</note> person of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his <note>Of his mischievous counsel and devilish will.</note> devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>
          <note>He returns to the confirmation of his apostleship, and brings forth both the testimonies of his labours, and also of God's blessing.</note>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I founde not Titus my brother, but tooke my leaue of them, and went away into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the <note>He alludes to the anointing of the priests, and the incense of the sacrifices.</note> savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>
          <note>He denies that anything should be taken away from the dignity of his apostleship, because they saw that it was not received with like success in every place. But rather very many rejected and detested him, seeing that he preached Christ not only as a saviour of those that believe, but also as a judge of those that condemn him.</note>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. <note>Again, he dismisses all suspicion of arrogance, attributing all things that he did to the power of God, whom he serves sincerely, and with honest affection. And he makes them witnesses of this, even to the sixth verse of the next chapter (2Co_2:17; 2Co_3:6).</note> And who [is] sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as many, which <note>We do not handle it craftily and covetously, or less sincerely than we ought. And he uses a metaphor, which is taken from hucksters, who used to play the false harlot with whatever came into their hands.</note> corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Doe we begin to praise our selues againe? or neede we as some other, epistles of recommendation vnto you, or letters of recommendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Yee are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is vnderstand, and read of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>[Forasmuch as ye are] <note>The apostle says this wisely, that by little and little he may come from the commendation of the person to the matter itself.</note> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ <note>Which I took pains to write as it were.</note> ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the <note>Along the way he sets the power of God against the ink with which epistles are commonly written, to show that it was accomplished by God.</note> living God; <note>He alludes along the way to the comparison of the outward ministry of the priesthood of Levi with the ministry of the Gospel, and the apostolical ministry, which he handles afterward more fully.</note> not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And such <note>This boldness we show, and thus may we boast gloriously of the worthiness and fruit of our ministry.</note> trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our <note>In that we are proper and able to make other men partakers of so great a grace.</note> sufficiency [is] of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>
          <note>He amplifies his ministry and his fellows: that is to say, the ministry of the Gospel comparing it with the ministry of the Law, which he considers in the person of Moses, by whom the Law was given: against whom he sets Christ the author of the Gospel. Now this comparison is taken from the very substance of the ministry. The Law is as it were a writing in itself, dead, and without efficacy: but the Gospel, and new Covenant, as it were the very power of God itself, in renewing, justifying, and saving men. The Law offers death, accusing all men of unrighteousness: the Gospel offers and gives righteousness and life. The administration of the Law served for a time to the promise: the Gospel remains to the end of the world. Therefore what is the glory of the Law in comparison of the majesty of the Gospel?</note>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the <note>Not of the Law but of the Gospel.</note> letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministration of death, written <note>Imprinted and engraved: so that by this place we may plainly perceive that the apostle speaks not of the ceremonies of the Law, but of the ten commandments.</note> [and] engraven in stones, was <note>This word «glorious» indicates a brightness, and a majesty which was in Moses physically, but in Christ spiritually.</note> glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>How shall not the <note>By which God offers, indeed, and gives the Spirit, not as a dead thing, but a living Spirit, working life.</note> ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of <note>That is, of Christ. And since he is imputed to us as our own, we are not condemned, and what is more we are also crowned as righteous.</note> righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For euen that which was glorified, was not glorified in this point, that is, as touching the exceeding glorie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is <note>The Law, indeed, and the ten commandments themselves, together with Moses, are all abolished, if we consider the ministry of Moses apart by itself.</note> done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>
          <note>He shows what this glory of the preaching of the Gospel consists in: that is, in that it sets forth plainly and evidently that which the Law showed darkly, for it sent those that heard it to be healed by Christ, who was to come, after it had wounded them.</note>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>
          <note>He expounds along the way the allegory of Moses' covering, which was a token of the darkness and weakness that is in men, who were rather dulled by the bright shining of the Law then given. And this covering was taken away by the coming of Christ, who enlightens the hearts, and turns them to the Lord, that we may be brought from the slavery of this blindness, and set in the liberty of the light by the power of Christ's Spirit.</note>And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the <note>Into the very bottom of Moses' ministry.</note> end of that which is abolished:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>Therefore their mindes are hardened: for vntill this day remaineth the same couering vntaken away in the reading of the olde Testament, which vaile in Christ is put away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But euen vnto this day, whe Moses is read, the vaile is laid ouer their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Neuertheles when their heart shall be turned to the Lord, the vaile shalbe taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the <note>Christ is that Spirit who takes away that covering, by working in our hearts, to which also the Law itself called us, though in vain, because it speaks to dead men, until the Spirit makes us alive.</note> Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>
          <note>Continuing in the allegory of the covering, he compares the Gospel to a glass, which although it is most bright and sparkling, yet it does not dazzle their eyes who look in it, as the Law does, but instead transforms them with its beams, so that they also are partakers of the glory and shining of it, to enlighten others: as Christ said unto his own, «You are the light of the world», whereas he himself alone is the light. We are also commanded in another place to shine as candles before the world, because we are partakers of God's Spirit. But Paul speaks here properly of the ministers of the Gospel, as it appears both by that which goes before, and that which comes after, and in that he sets before them his own example and that of his fellows.</note>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore <note>Now he plainly witnesses that both he and his associates (through the mercy of God) do their vocation and duty uprightly and sincerely, neglecting all dangers.</note> seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we <note>Though we are broken in pieces with miseries and calamities, yet we do not yield.</note> faint not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But have renounced the <note>Subtilty and every type of deceit which men hunt after, as it were dens and lurking holes, to cover their shameless dealings with.</note> hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God <note>This is that which he called in the former chapter, making merchandise of the word of God.</note> deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>
          <note>An objection: many hear the Gospel, and yet are no more enlightened by it than by the preaching of the Law. He answers, «The fault is in the men themselves, whose eyes Satan plucks out, who rules in this world.» And yet nonetheless he and his associates set forth the most clear light of the Gospel to be seen and beheld, seeing that Christ only whom they preach, is he in whom God will be known, and as it were seen.</note>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the <note>The light of plain and enlightening preaching, which shows forth the glory of Christ.</note> light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the <note>In whom the Father sets himself forth to be seen and beheld.</note> image of God, should shine unto them.</verse>

          <note>He removes according to his accustomed manner, all suspicion of ambition, affirming that he teaches faithfully, but as a servant, and witnessing that all this light which he and his associates give to others, proceeds from the Lord.</note>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for <note>To preach this self same Jesus to you.</note> Jesus' sake.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>
          <note>He takes away a stumbling block, which darkened among some, the bright shining of the ministry of the Gospel, that is, because the apostles were the most miserable of all men. Paul answers that he and his associates are as it were, earthen vessels, but yet there is in them a most precious treasure.</note>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, <note>He brings marvellous reasons why the Lord does so afflict his principal servants, to the end, he says, that all men may perceive that they do not stand by any man's power, but by the singular power of God, in that they die a thousand times, but never perish.</note> that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</verse>

          <note>An amplification of the former sentence, in which he compares his afflictions to a daily death, and the power of the Spirit of God in Christ to life, who oppresses that death.</note>Always bearing about in the body the <note>So Paul calls that miserable estate and condition that the faithful, but especially the minsters, are in.</note> dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we which <note>Who live that life, that is, by the Spirit of Christ, among so many and so great miseries.</note> live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our <note>Subject to that miserable condition.</note> mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>
          <note>A very wise conclusion: as if he would say, «Therefore, to be short, we die that you may live by our death», because they ventured into all those dangers for the building of the Church's sake, and they ceased not to strengthen and encourage all the faithful with the examples of their patience.</note>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>
          <note>He declares the former sentence, showing that he and his associates die in a way to purchase life for others, but yet nonetheless they are partakers of the same life with them: because they themselves do first believe that which they offer to others to believe, that is, that they also will be saved together with them in Christ.</note>We having the same <note>The same faith, by the inspiration of the same Spirit.</note> spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;</verse>

          <note>He shows how this constancy is preserved in them, that is, because they are doing it for God's glory, and the salvation of the churches committed to them.</note>For all things [are] for your sakes, <note>When it will please God to deliver me, and restore me to you, that exceeding benefit which will be poured upon me will in like sort result to the glory of God, by the thanksgiving of many.</note> that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>For which cause we faint not; <note>He adds as it were a triumphant song, that he is outwardly afflicted, but inwardly he profits daily: and he is not bothered by all the miseries that may be sustained in this life, in comparison of that most constant and eternal glory.</note> but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is <note>Gathers new strength so that the outward man is not overcome with the miseries which come freshly one after another, being maintained and upheld with the strength of the inward man.</note> renewed day by day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For <note>Taking occasion by the former comparison, he compares this miserable body as it is in this life, to a frail and brittle tabernacle. And contrasts this with the heavenly tabernacle, which he calls that sure and everlasting condition of this same body glorified in heaven. And this is so, he says, in that we are addicted to this tabernacle, but also with sobs and sighs desire rather that tabernacle. And so this place concerning the glory to come is put within the treatise of the dignity of the ministry, just as it also was in the beginning of the second chapter.</note> we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be <note>He calls the glory of immortality, which we will be as it were clothed with, a garment.</note> clothed upon with our house which is from <note>Heavenly, not that the substance of it is heavenly, but rather the glory of it.</note> heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>
          <note>An exposition of the former saying: we do not without reason desire to be clad with the heavenly house, that is, with that everlasting and immortal glory, as with a garment. For when we depart from here we will not remain naked, having cast off the covering of this body, but we will take our bodies again, which will put on as it were another garment besides. And therefore we do not sigh because of the weariness of this life, but because of the desire of a better life. Neither is this desire in vain, for we are made to that life, the pledge of which we have, even the Spirit of adoption.</note>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For in deede we that are in this tabernacle, sigh and are burdened, because we would not be vnclothed, but would be clothed vpon, that mortalitie might be swalowed vp of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he that hath <note>He means that first creation, to show us that our bodies were made to this end, that they should be clothed with heavenly immortality.</note> wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>
          <note>He concludes something here from verse four, and states it in the following way: «Therefore, seeing that we know by the Spirit that we are strangers so long as we are here, we patiently suffer this delay (for we are now so with God, that we behold him only by faith, and are therefore now absent from him) but so that we aspire and have a longing always to him. Therefore also we behave ourselves in such a way that we may be acceptable to him, both while we live here, and when we go from here to him.» (2Co_5:4)</note>Therefore [we are] always <note>He calls them «confident» who are always resolved with a quiet and settled mind to suffer any danger at all, not doubting at all that their end will be happy.</note> confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(For we walk by <note>Faith, of those things which we hope for, not having God presently in our physical view.</note> faith, not by sight:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are <note>And yet we are in such a manner confident and do so pass on our pilgrimage with a valiant and peaceful mind, that yet nonetheless we had rather depart from here to the Lord.</note> confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Wherefore we <note>And seeing that it is so, we strive to live so, that both in this our pilgrimage here we may please him, and that at length we may be received home to him.</note> labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>
          <note>That no man might think that what he spoke of that heavenly glory pertains to all, he adds that every one will first render an account of his pilgrimage, after he has departed from here.</note>For we must all <note>We must all appear personally, and enquiry will be made of us, that all may see how we have lived.</note> appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>
          <note>Now he moves on, and taking occasion of the former sentence returns to (2Co_4:16), confirming his own and his associates sincerity.</note>Knowing therefore the <note>That terrible judgment.</note> terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>
          <note>He removes all suspicion of pride by a new reason, because it is a responsibility, not for his part but for theirs, that his apostleship be considered sincere compared to the vain display of a few others.</note>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in <note>In outward disguising, and that pretentious show of man's wisdom and eloquence, and not in true godliness, which is sealed in the heart.</note> appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>
          <note>The meaning is: even when I am mad (as some men think of me), while I seem as a fool to boast about myself, I do it for your profit, to the same extent that I do when I preach only the Gospel to you.</note>For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>
          <note>He continues dismissing all suspicion of desire of estimation and boasting. For the love of Christ, he says, compels us to this, that seeing he died for us all, who were dead when as we lived to ourselves (that is, while we were yet given to these earthly affections) we in like sort should consecrate our whole life which we have received from him, to him. That is, being endued with the Holy Spirit to this end and purpose, that we should meditate upon nothing but that which is heavenly.</note>For the love of Christ <note>Wholly possesses us.</note> constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if <note>He speaks here of sanctification, by which it comes to pass that Christ lives in us.</note> one died for all, then were all dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth <note>See {{See Romans 6:1-7:25}}</note> live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>
          <note>He shows what it is not to live to ourselves but to Christ, that is, to know no man according to the flesh. That is to say, to be conversant among men and yet not to care for those worldly and carnal things, as those do who have regard for a man's family, his country, form, glory, riches, and such like, in which men commonly dote and weary themselves.</note>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: <note>An amplification: «This is», he says, «so true, that we do not now think carnally of Christ himself, who has now left the world, and therefore he must be thought of spiritually by us.»</note> yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>
          <note>An exhortation for every man who is renewed with the Spirit of Christ to meditate on heavenly things, and not earthly.</note>Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a <note>As a thing made new by God, for though a man is not newly created when God gives him the spirit of regeneration, but only his qualities are changed, yet nonetheless it pleased the Holy Spirit to speak so, to teach us that we must attribute all things to the glory of God. Not that we are as rocks or stones, but because God creates in us both the will to will well, and the power to do well.</note> new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>
          <note>He commends the excellency of the ministry of the Gospel, both by the authority of God himself, who is the author of that ministry, and also by the excellency of the doctrine of it. For it announces atonement with God by free forgiveness of our sins, and justification offered to us in Christ, and that so lovingly and freely, that God himself does in a way beseech men by the mouth of his ministers to have consideration of themselves, and not to despise so great a benefit. And when he says so, he plainly reprehends those who falsely attribute to themselves the name of «pastor», as this calling can only come from God.</note>And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath <note>Used our labour and travail.</note> committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Now then are we ambassadours for Christ: as though God did beseeche you through vs, we pray you in Christes steade, that ye be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he hath made him [to be] <note>A sinner, not in himself, but by imputation of the guilt of all our sins to him.</note> sin for us, who <note>Who was completely void of sin.</note> knew no sin; that we might be made the <note>Righteous before God, and that with righteousness which is not fundamental in us, but being fundamental in Christ, God imputes it to us through faith.</note> righteousness of God in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We <note>Men do not only need the ministry of the Gospel before they have received grace, in order that they may be partakers of the Gospel, but also after they have received grace they need to continue in it.</note> then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>
          <note>He shows the Corinthians a pattern of a true minister in his own example, and in Timothy and Silvanus, to the end that he might procure authority for himself and his companions like him, as he purposed from the beginning.</note>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</verse>

          <note>Secondly he reckons up such virtues as are necessary, and ought alway be in them, and by which as by good armour, all pitfalls and hindrances may be overcome.</note>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</verse>

And he adds moreover, that he is also glad now that he drove them to that sorrow even though it was against his will, since it was so profitable to them. For there is a sorrow not only praiseworthy, but also necessary, that is, by which repentance grows by certain degrees: and for this repentance he praises them highly. And this is the fifth part of this epistle.</note>For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For <note>He wisely answers the suspicion which the Corinthians might conceive, as though the apostle in urging them so carefully was doubting of their good will. Therefore he witnesses that he does it not to teach them that they ought to help the saints, seeing that he had become surety for them to the Macedonians. But only to stir those up who were labouring by themselves, to the end that all things might both be in a better readiness, and also be more plentiful.</note> as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I knowe your readinesse of minde, whereof I boast my selfe of you vnto them of Macedonia, and say, that Achaia was prepared a yeere agoe, and your zeale hath prouoked many.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] <note>As from covetous men.</note> covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>
          <note>Alms must be given neither grudgingly, nor with a loathful mind, or sparingly.

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now <note>He returns to the defence of his apostleship, but in such a way that he uses his authority in his defence: for he warns them earnestly and gravely, using also terrible threatenings, to show themselves to be those who are able to be instructed. And he reviles certain proud men who made no better account of him, than of a bragging proud man, in that he used to be sharp against them when he was absent, because they saw no great majesty in him after the manner of men; and besides, he had proved his gentleness, even though in his absence he had written to them sharply. Therefore first of all he professes that he was gentle and moderate, but after the example of Christ: but if they continue still to despise his gentleness, he protests to them that he will show indeed how far they are deceived, who judge the office of an apostle in the same way that they judge worldly offices, that is, according to the outward appearance.</note> I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and <note>That nature which is inclined to mercy, rather than to rigor of justice.</note> gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked <note>As though I had no other aid and help than that which outwardly I seem to have: and therefore Paul contrasts his flesh, that is, his weak condition and state, with his spiritual and apostolic dignity.</note> according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>
          <note>Secondly, he witnesses that although he is similar to other men, yet he comes furnished with that strength which no defence of man can match, whether they resist by craft and deceit, or by force and might, because he battles with divine weapons.</note>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not <note>Are not those weapons that men get authority over one another with, and do great acts.</note> carnal, but mighty through <note>Stand upon the foundation of God's infinite power.</note> God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, <note>An amplification of this spiritual power, which conquers the enemies in such a way, be they ever so crafty and mighty, that it brings some of them by repentance to Christ, and justly avenges others that are stubbornly obstinate, separating them from the others who allow themselves to be ruled.</note> and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And hauing ready the vengeance against all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>
          <note>He emphasises the same matter with very weighty words and sentences.</note>Do ye look on things after the <note>Do you judge things according to the outward appearance?</note> outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of <note>Not being told about it by me.</note> himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ's, even so [are] we Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie, which the Lorde hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your destruction, I should haue no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>This I say, that I may not seeme as it were to feare you with letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For [his] letters, say <note>He notes out those who were the cause of these words.</note> they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such one thinke this, that such as wee are in woorde by letters, when we are absent, such wil we be also in deede, when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>
          <note>Being forced to refute the foolish braggings of certain ambitious men, he witnesses that they are able to bring nothing, but that they falsely think highly of themselves. And as for himself, although he brags of excellent things, yet he will not pass the bounds which God has measured him out. And according to these bounds he came even to them in preaching the Gospel of Christ, and trusts that he will go further, when they have so profited that he will not need to remain any longer among them to instruct them. And to this is added an amplification, in that he never followed the labours of other men.</note>For we <note>This is spoken in a taunting manner.</note> dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by <note>Upon a vain persuasion that they have of themselves, they attribute to themselves anything at all.</note> themselves, and <note>They condemn others, and measure all their doings only by themselves.</note> comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast of things without [our] <note>Of those things which God has not measured to me.</note> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we stretche not our selues beyonde our measure, as though wee had not attained vnto you: for euen to you also haue we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>Not boasting of things <note>As though God had divided the whole world among the apostles to be governed.</note> without [our] measure, [that is], of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in <note>In countries which other men have prepared and cultivated with the preaching of the Gospel.</note> another man's line of things made ready to our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>
          <note>He somewhat moderates that which he spoke of himself, and in so doing also prepares the Corinthians to hear other things, witnessing that he seeks nothing else but to approve himself to God, whose glory alone he seeks.</note>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For hee that praiseth himselfe, is not alowed, but he whome the Lorde praiseth.</verse>

          <note>He shows that they deceive themselves, if they look to receive from any other man, either a more excellent Gospel, or more excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit.</note>For if he that cometh preacheth <note>A more perfect doctrine of Jesus Christ.</note> another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].</verse>

          <note>He refutes the slanders of those boastful and proud men. I grant, he says, that I am not so eloquent an orator, but yet they cannot take away the knowledge of the Gospel from me, of which you have had good proof, and that in every manner of way.</note>But though [I be] <note>Paul did not lack the type of eloquence which is proper for a man, and fit for the Gospel, but he willingly lacked that eloquent type of speech, which too many now a days search after and follow.</note> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>
          <note>Another slander, that is, that he was a rascal, and lived by the labour of his own hands. But in this, the apostle says, what can you lay against me, except that I was content to take any pains for your sakes? For when I lacked, I travailed for my living with my own hands. And also when poverty forced me, I chose rather to seek my sustenance than to be any burden to you, even though I preached the Gospel to you.</note>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other Churches, and tooke wages of them to doe you seruice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, <note>An amplification: so far is he from being ashamed of this act, that he has also resolved with himself to act in no other way while he is among them, in order that it may always be truly said that he taught in Achaia for nothing. And this is not because he disdains the Corinthians, but rather so that these proud and boastful men may never find the occasion which they have already sought for, and he in the meantime may set something before the Corinthians to follow, so that at length they may truly say that they are like Paul.</note> and [so] will I keep [myself].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the <note>This is a form of an oath, as if he said, «Let me not be thought to have any truth in me.»</note> truth of Christ is in me, no man shall <note>Will be always open to me.</note> stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.</verse>

And if he had done this, then they hoped by this means to be equal to him. For they made such a show of zeal and knowledge, and set it forth with such a flattering type of eloquence, that some of them even despised Paul.

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>
          <note>Now at length he portrays these fellows as they truly are, forewarning that it will come to pass that they will at length betray themselves, no matter how they may be pretending that they have a zeal for God's glory.</note>For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</verse>

          <note>He goes forward boldly, and using a vehement irony or type of taunting, desires the Corinthians to pardon him, if for a time he argues as a fool before them, who are wise, along with those other wise ones, as he talks about those external things such as his stock, his ancestors, and valiant acts.</note>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>How that he was caught up into <note>So the Greeks name that which we call a park, that is to say, a place where trees are planted, and wild beasts kept.

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>
          <note>To remove all suspicion of seeking glory, he witnesses that he brags not of those things as though they were of himself, but as outside of himself. And yet nonetheless he pretends nothing, lest by this occasion other men should attribute to him more than he indeed is: and therefore he would rather glory in his miseries.</note>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For though I woulde reioyce, I should not be a foole, for I will say the trueth: but I refraine, lest any man should thinke of me aboue that hee seeth in me, or that he heareth of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>
          <note>An excellent doctrine: why God will have even his best servants to be vexed by Satan, and by every type of temptations: that is, lest they should be too much puffed up, and also that they may be made perfect by being continually exercised in them.</note>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me <note>He means sinful lust, that sticks fast in us as it were a thorn, to such a degree that it forced Paul himself who was regenerated to cry out, «I do not that good that I would», etc. And he calls it a thorn by a metaphor taken from thorns, or stumps, which are very dangerous and harmful for the feet, if a man walks through woods that are cut down.</note> a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of <note>Which sets those lusts on fire.</note> Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>For this thing I besought the Lord <note>Often.</note> thrice, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. <note>He concludes that he will only set his miseries against the vain braggings of the false apostles, and with this also excuses himself, because by their troublesome braggings he was forced to speak as much of those things as he did. That is, because if his apostleship were subverted, his doctrine would necessarily fall.</note> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may <note>That I might feel the power of Christ more and more: for the weaker that our tabernacles are, the more does Christ's power appear in them.</note> rest upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I take <note>I do not only take them patiently and with a good heart, but I also take great pleasure in them.</note> pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: <note>Again he makes the Corinthians witnesses of those things by which God had sealed his apostleship among them, and again he declares by certain arguments how far he is from all covetousness, and also how he is affectionate towards them.</note> for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the <note>The arguments by which it may well appear that I am indeed an apostle of Jesus Christ.</note> signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not <note>I was not slothful with my own hands, so that I might not be burdensome to you.</note> burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, the thirde time I am ready to come vnto you, and yet will I not be slouthfull to your hinderance: for I seeke not yours, but you: for the children ought not to laye vp for the fathers, but the fathers for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I will most gladly bestow, and will be bestowed for your soules: though the more I loue you, the lesse I am loued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>
          <note>He sets aside another most grievous slander, that is, that he did subtly and by others make his gain and profit of them.</note>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I pill you by any of them whom I sent vnto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I haue desired Titus, and with him I haue sent a brother: did Titus pill you of any thing? walked we not in the selfe same spirit? walked we not in the same steppes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>
          <note>He concludes that he does not write these things to them as though he needed to defend himself, for he is guilty of nothing: but because it is appropriate for them to doubt nothing of his fidelity, who instructed them.</note>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in <note>As it becomes him to speak truly and sincerely, that professes himself to be in Christ, that is to say, to be a Christian.</note> Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>
          <note>Having confirmed his authority to them, he rebukes them sharply, and threatens them also like an apostle, showing that he will not spare them from now on, unless they repent, seeing that this is the third time that he has warned them.</note>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>I feare least when I come againe, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many of them which haue sinned already, and haue not repented of the vncleannesse, and fornication, and wantonnesse which they haue committed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>Lo this is the thirde time that I come vnto you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall euery worde stand</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I tolde you before, and tell you before: as though I had bene present the seconde time, so write I nowe being absent to them which heretofore haue sinned and to all others, that if I come againe, I will not spare,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>
          <note>A most sharp reprehension, because, while they despise the apostle's admonitions, they tempt Christ's own patience: and also while they condemn him as wretched and miserable, they lay nothing against him, which is not common to him with Christ.</note>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is <note>And will be most mighty to be avenged upon you, when need will be.</note> mighty in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For though he was crucified through <note>Regarding that base form of a servant which he took upon him when he abased himself.</note> weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>
          <note>He confirms that which he spoke about the power of God appearing in his ministry, and he gathers by the mutual relation between the people's faith and the minister's preaching, that they must either reverence his apostleship, upon whose doctrine their faith is grounded, or they must condemn themselves of infidelity, and must confess themselves not to be of Christ's body.</note>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>
          <note>He appeases that sharpness, trusting that they will show themselves towards their faithful apostle, able and willing to be taught. And he also adds this, that he does not seek his own fame and estimation, so that they may serve their saviour, which is the only mark that he shoots at.</note>But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as <note>In men's judgment.</note> reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For wee can not doe any thing against the trueth, but for the trueth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your <note>That all things may be in good order among you, and the members of the church restored into their place, which have been shaken and are out of place.</note> perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore write I these thinges being absent, least when I am present, I should vse sharpenesse, according to the power which the Lorde hath giuen mee, to edification, and not to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>
          <note>A brief exhortation, but yet such a one as comprehends all the parts of a Christian man's life.</note>Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>
          <note>He salutes them familiarly, and in conclusion wishes well to them.</note>Greet one another with an holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>{\cf2 (13:12)} All the Saintes salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>{\cf2 (13:13)} The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the loue of God, and the communion of the holy Ghost be with you all, Amen. The seconde Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Philippi, a citie in Macedonia, and sent by Titus and Lucas.</verse>
