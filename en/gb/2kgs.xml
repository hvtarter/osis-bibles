      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. <note>The Argument - This second book contains the acts of the kings of Judah and Israel: that is, of Israel, from the death of Ahab to the last king Hoshea, who was imprisoned by the king of Assyria, and his city Samaria taken, and the ten tribes led into captivity by the just plague of God for their idolatry and disobedience to God. Also of Judah, from the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat to Zedekiah, who for contemning the Lord's commandment by his prophets, and neglecting his many admonitions by famine and other means was taken by his enemies, saw his sons most cruelly slain before his face, and his own eyes put out, as the Lord had declared to him before by his prophet Jeremiah. By the just vengeance of God for contempt of his word Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple burnt, and he and all his people were led away captives into Babylon. In this book are notable examples of God's favour toward those rulers and people who obey his prophets, and embrace his word: and contrariwise of his plagues on those who neglect his ministers, and do not obey his commandments.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And <note>So that he was punished for his idolatry in two ways: for the Moabites which were wont to pay him tribute rebelled and he fell out a window which was high in his house to give light beneath.</note> Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that [was] in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of <note>The Philistines who lived at Ekron worshipped this idol, the god of flies, thinking that he could preserve them from the biting of flies: or else he was so called, because flies were drawn in great abundance by the blood of the sacrifices that were offered to that idol.</note> Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, <note>He shows that idolaters do not have the true God, or else they would seek none but him alone.</note> [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Wherefore thus saith the Lorde, Thou shalt not come downe from the bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death. So Eliiah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And the messengers returned vnto him, to whome he said, Why are ye nowe returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, <note>Ignorance is the mother of error and idolatry.</note> [Is it] not because [there is] not a God in Israel, [that] thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he saide vnto them, What maner of man was he which came and met you, and tolde you these wordes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, [He was] an <note>Some think that this meant his garments, which were rough and made of hair.</note> hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It [is] Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top <note>That is, Carmel.</note> of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. <note>He declares the power God's word has in the mouth of his servants, when they threaten God's judgments against the wicked.</note> And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, <note>He spoke this in mockery, and therefore provoked God's wrath so much more.</note> O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said unto them, <note>Meaning, that God would show by effect whether he was a true prophet or not.</note> If I [be] a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my <note>Which humble myself before God and his servant.</note> life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be <note>That is, spare my life, and do not let me die as the other two.</note> precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Beholde, there came fire downe from the heauen and deuoured the two former captaines ouer fiftie with their fifties: therefore let my life nowe be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be <note>Thus the Lord gives boldness to his, that they fear not the threatenings of tyrants, who otherwise of themselves are afraid to do God's message.</note> not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he saide vnto him, Thus saith the Lorde, Because thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, (was it not because there was no God in Israel to inquire of his worde?) therefore thou shalt not come downe off the bed, on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And <note>Jehoshaphat going to battle against the Syrians, made his son Jehoram king in the 17th year of his reign: and in the 18th year which was the second year of his son, Jehoram the son of Ahab reigned in Israel: and in the fifth year of this Jehoram Jehoshaphat died, and the kingdom of Judah was confirmed to his son.</note> Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahaziah, that he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from <note>Which was the place where the children of Israel were circumcised after they came over Jordan and had been forty years in the wilderness, (Jos_5:9).</note> Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>Then Eliiah saide to Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Bethel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came downe to Beth-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the <note>So called, because they are begotten anew as it were by the heavenly doctrine.</note> sons of the prophets that [were] at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from <note>That is, from being your head any more: for to be as the head, is to be the master, as to be at the feet, is to be a scholar.</note> thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I <note>For the Lord had revealed it to him.</note> know [it]; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Againe Eliiah saide vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iericho: But he said, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that [were] at <note>Not only at Bethel, but at Jericho and other places were there prophets, who had scholars, whom they instructed and brought up in the true fear of God.</note> Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know [it]; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>Moreouer Eliiah saide vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iorden. But he saide, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they went both together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went and stoode on the other side a farre off, and they two stoode by Iorden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the <note>That is, of Jordan.</note> waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, <note>Let your spirit have double force in me, because of these dangerous times: or let me have twice as much as the rest of the prophets: or if your spirit were to be divided into three parts, let me have two.</note> let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he saide, Thou hast asked an hard thing: yet if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt haue it so: &amp; if not, it shal not be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into <note>Thus God has left a testimony in all ages (both before the law, in the law and in the gospel).</note> heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cryed, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: and he sawe him no more: and he tooke his owne clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He tooke vp also the cloke of Eliiah that fell from him, and returned, and stoode by the banke of Iorden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>After, he tooke the cloke of Eliiah, that fell from him, and smote the waters, and sayde, Where is the Lord God of Eliiah? And so he also, after he had striken the waters, so that they were deuided this way and that way, went ouer, euen Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The <note>The Spirit of prophecy was given to him as it was to Elijah.</note> spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, <note>Because the fact was extraordinary, they doubted where he had gone, but Elisha was assured that he was taken up to God.</note> Ye shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>Yet they were instant vpon him, til he was ashamed: wherefore he saide, Sende. So they sent fiftie men, which sought three dayes, but founde him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>Therefore they returned to him, (for he taryed at Iericho) and he said vnto them, Did not I say vnto you, Goe not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the citie saide vnto Elisha, Beholde, we pray thee: the situation of this citie is pleasant, as thou, my lorde, seest, but the water is naught, and the ground baren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>Then he saide, Bring me a newe cruse, and put salt therein; they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast <note>Thus God gave him power, even contrary to nature, to make the water profitable for man's use, which before was hurtful.</note> the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren [land].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed vntill this day, according to the worde of Elisha which hee had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went vp from thence vnto Beth-el; as he was going vp the way, litle children came out of the citie, and mocked him, and saide vnto him, Come vp, thou balde head, come vp, thou balde head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and <note>Perceiving their malicious heart against the Lord and his word, he asks God to avenge the injury done to him.</note> cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>So he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the <note>Read the annotation in (2Ki_1:17).</note> eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he wrought euill in the sight of the Lorde, but not like his father nor like his mother: for he tooke away the image of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he cleaved unto the <note>He sacrificed to the golden calves that Jeroboam had made.</note> sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And <note>This was done after David had made the Moabites tributaries to his successors.</note> Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>Therefore King Iehoram went out of Samaria the same season, and nombred all Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: <note>Read (1Ki_22:4).</note> I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>Then said he, What way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way of the wildernesse of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the <note>Meaning the viceroy, or lieutenant of the king of Judah, (1Ki_22:47).</note> king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>Therefore the King of Israel sayde, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, which <note>That is, who was his servant.</note> poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, <note>He is able to instruct us what God's will is in this point.</note> The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, <note>He knew that this wicked king would have but used his counsel to serve his turn, and therefore, he disdained to answer him.</note> What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, <note>The wicked do not esteem the servants of God unless they are driven by every necessity and fear of the present danger.</note> Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would <note>God suffers his word to be declared to the wicked because of the godly that are among them.</note> not look toward thee, nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel <note>He sang songs to God's glory, and so stirred up the prophets heart to prophecy.</note> played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he saide, Thus saith the Lorde, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus saith the Lorde, Ye shall neither see winde nor see raine, yet the valley shalbe filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye and your cattel, and your beastes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is [but] a <note>He will not only miraculously give you waters, but your enemies also into your hand.</note> light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and <note>Though God bestows his benefits for a time on the enemies, yet he has his seasons, when he will take them away to the intent they might see his vengeance which is prepared for them.</note> mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And in the morning whe the meat offring was offred, beholde, there came water by the way of Edom: and the countrey was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when al the Moabites heard that the Kings were come vp to fight against them, they gathered all that was able to put on harnesse, &amp; vpwarde, and stood in their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose earely in the morning, when the sunne arose vpon the water, and the Moabites saw the water ouer against them, as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, <note>The sudden joy of the wicked is but a preparation for their destruction, which is at hand.</note> This [is] blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they <note>Meaning, they followed them into the towns.</note> went forward smiting the Moabites, even in [their] country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in <note>Which was one of the principle cities of the Moabites, in which they left nothing but the walls.</note> Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about [it], and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the King of Moab saw that the battel was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hudreth men that drew the sword, to break through vnto the King of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and <note>Some refer it to the king of Edom's son, whom they say he had taken in that skirmish: but rather it seemed to be his own son, whom he offered to his gods to pacify them: which barbarous cruelty moved the Israelites hearts of pity to depart.</note> offered him [for] a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to [their own] land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>
          <note>(2Ki_2:3).</note>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did <note>And therefore did not fall into debt by carelessness or excess but by the hand of the Lord.</note> fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be <note>Because I am poor and not able to pay.</note> bondmen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.1'>Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, <note>The godly are always assured of God's help in their necessity, but the times and hours are only revealed by God's Spirit.</note> To morrow about this time [shall] a measure of fine flour [be sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.2'>Then a lord on whose hand the king <note>To whom the king gave the charge and oversight of things as in (2Ki_7:17).</note> leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, [if] the LORD would make <note>He mocked at the prophets words saying, that if God rained down corn from heaven, yet this could not come to pass.</note> windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see [it] with thine eyes, but shalt not <note>Your infidelity will be punished in this when you see this miracle, and yet not partake of it.</note> eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.3'>And there were four leprous men at the <note>For it was commanded in the law that they should dwell apart, and not among their brethren, (Lev_13:46).</note> entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.4'>If we say, We will enter into the citie, the famine is in the citie, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, we dye also. Nowe therefore come, and let vs fall into the campe of the Aramites: if they saue our liues, we shall liue: and if they kill vs, we are but dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.5'>So they rose vp in the twilight, to goe to the campe of the Aramites: and when they were come to the vtmost part of the campe of the Aramites, loe, there was no man there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.6'>For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a <note>Thus God needs no great preparation to destroy the wicked. Though they are many he can scatter them with a small noise, or shaking of a leaf.</note> noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, [even] the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it [was], and <note>The wicked need no greater enemy than their own conscience to pursue them.</note> fled for their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.8'>And when these lepers came to the vtmost part of the campe, they entred into one tent, and did eate and drinke, and caryed thence siluer and golde, and raiment, and went and hid it: after they returned, and entred into another tent, and caryed thence also, and went and hid it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.9'>Then saide one to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we holde our peace. If we tary till day light, some mischiefe will come vpon vs. Nowe therefore, come, let vs goe, and tell the Kings housholde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.10'>So they came, and called vnto the porters of the citie, and tolde them, saying, We came to the campe of the Aramites, and loe, there was no man there, neither voyce of man, but horses tyed and asses tyed: and the tents are as they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.11'>And the porters cryed and declared to the Kings house within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.12'>And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, <note>He mistrusted the prophets words, and therefore could believe nothing, as they who are more prudent than godly always cast more doubt than is needed.</note> I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we [be] hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.13'>And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the <note>There are no more left, but they, or the rest are consumed by the famine, as the rest of the people.</note> multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, [I say], they [are] even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.14'>So they tooke two charets of horses, and the King sent after the hoste of the Aramites, saying, Goe and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.15'>And they went after them vnto Iorden, and loe, all the way was full of clothes and vessels which the Aramites had cast from them in their hast: &amp; the messengers returned, and told ye King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.16'>And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, <note>Which he spoke by the mouth of Elisha, (2Ki_7:1).</note> according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.17'>And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people <note>As the people pressed out of the gate to run to the Syrian's tents, where they had heard meat and great spoil was left.</note> trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.18'>And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the King, saying, Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine floure shall be at a shekel, to morowe about this time in the gate of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.19'>But the prince had answered the man of God, and saide, Though the Lorde would make windowes in the heauen, coulde it come so to passe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eate thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.20'>And so it came vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he dyed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.1'>Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou <note>Where you can find a convenient place to dwell, where there is plenty.</note> canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.2'>And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God, and went both shee and her housholde and soiourned in the lande of the Philistims seuen yeeres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.3'>And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth <note>That is, to complain of them who had taken her possessions while she was absent.</note> to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.4'>And the King talked with Gehazi the seruant of the man of God, saying, Tell mee, I pray thee, all the great actes, that Elisha hath done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.5'>And it came to pass, as he was telling <note>God's wonderful providence appears in this, that he caused the king to desire to hear him, whom before he contemned and also hereby prepared an entrance to the poor widows suit.</note> the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.6'>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the <note>The king caused that to be justly restored which was wrongfully withheld from her.</note> fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.7'>Then Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad the King of Aram was sicke, and one told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.8'>And the king sayd vnto Hazael, Take a present in thine hande, and goe meete the man of God, that thou mayest inquire of ye Lord by him, saying, Shall I recouer of this disease?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.9'>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every <note>Of all the chiefest and precious things of the country.</note> good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.10'>And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly <note>Meaning that he would recover of this disease: but he knew that this messenger Hazael would slay him to obtain the kingdom.</note> recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.11'>And hee looked vpon him stedfastly, till Hazael was ashamed, and the man of God wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.12'>And Hazael sayde, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I knowe the euill that thou shalt do vnto the children of Israel: for their strong cities shalt thou set on fire, and their yong men shalt thou slay with the sworde, and shalt dash their infantes against the stones, and rent in pieces their women with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.13'>And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant <note>That I should be without all humanity and pity.</note> a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou [shalt be] king over Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.14'>So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What saide Elisha to thee? And he answered, Hee tolde mee that thou shouldest recouer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.15'>And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped [it] in water, and <note>Under pretence to refresh or ease him, he suffocated him with his cloak.</note> spread [it] on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.16'>And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat [being] then king of Judah, <note>Read (2Ki_1:17).</note> Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.19'>Yet the Lord would not destroy Iudah, for Dauid his seruants sake, as he had promised him to giue him a light, and to his children for euer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.20'>In his days Edom <note>Which had been subject from David's time until this time of Jehoram.</note> revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.21'>Therefore Ioram went to Zair, and all his charets with him, and he arose by night, &amp; smote the Edomites which were about him with the captains of the charets, and the people fled into their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.22'>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then <note>This was a city in Judah given to the Levites, (Jos_21:13) that later turned from king Jehoram, because of his idolatry.</note> Libnah revolted at the same time.</verse>
