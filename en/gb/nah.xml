      <chapter osisID='Nah.1'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.1'>The <note>{{See Isa_13:1}}</note> burden of Nineveh. <note>The vision or revelation, which God commanded Nahum to write concerning the Ninevites.</note> The book of the vision of Nahum the <note>That is, born in a poor village in the tribe of Simeon.</note> Elkoshite. <note>The Argument - As those of Nineveh showed themselves prompt and ready to receive the word of God at Jonah's preaching, and so turned to the Lord by repentance, so after a certain time they gave themselves to worldly means to increase their dominion, rather than seeking to continue in that fear of God, and path in which they had begun. They cast off the care of religion, and so returned to their vomit and provoked God's just judgment against them, in afflicting his people. Therefore their city Nineveh was destroyed, and Meroch-baladan, king of Babel (or as some think, Nebuchadnezzar) enjoyed the empire of the Assyrians. But because God has a continual care for his Church, he stirs up his Prophet to comfort the godly, showing that the destruction of their enemies would be for their consolation: and as it seems, he prophesies around the time of Hezekiah, and not in the time of Manasseh his son, as the Jews write.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.2'>God [is] <note>Meaning, of his glory.</note> jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and <note>With his own he is but angry for a time, but his anger is never appeased toward the reprobate, even though he defers it for a time.</note> [is] furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth [wrath] for his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.3'>The <note>Thus the wicked would make God's mercy an occasion to sin, but the Prophet wishes them to consider his power and justice.</note> LORD [is] slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit [the wicked]: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds [are] the dust of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.4'>He rebuketh the sea, and dryeth it, and he dryeth vp all the riuers: Bashan is wasted and Carmel, and the floure of Lebanon is wasted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.5'>The mountaines tremble for him, and the hilles melt, &amp; the earth is burnt at his sight, yea, the worlde, and all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.6'>
          <note>If all creatures are at God's commandment, and none are able to resist his wrath, will man flatter himself, and think by any means to escape, when he provokes his God to anger?</note>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.7'>The LORD [is] good, <note>Lest the faithful should be discouraged by hearing the power of God, he shows them that his mercy appertains to them, and that he has care over them.</note> a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.8'>But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the <note>Signifying that God will suddenly destroy Nineveh and the Assyrians in such a way, that they will lie in perpetual darkness, and never recover their strength again.</note> place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.9'>What do ye <note>He shows that the undertakings of the Assyrians against Judah and the Church were against God, and therefore he would so destroy them the first time, that he would not need to return the second time.</note> imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.10'>For while [they be] folden together [as] <note>Though the Assyrians think themselves like thorns that prick on all sides, yet the Lord will set fire on them, and as drunken men are not able to stand against any force, so they will not be able to resist him at all.</note> thorns, and while they are drunken [as] drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.11'>There is [one] <note>Which may be understood either of Sennacherib, or of the whole body of the people of Nineveh.</note> come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.12'>Thus saith the LORD; Though [they be] <note>Though they think themselves in most safety, and of greatest strength, yet when God will pass by, he will destroy them: nonetheless, he comforts his Church, and promises to stop punishing them by the Assyrians.</note> quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.13'>For nowe I will breake his yoke from thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.14'>And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, [that] no more of thy name be <note>Meaning, Sennacherib, who would have no more children, but be slain in the house of his gods; (2Ki_19:36-37).</note> sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.1.15'>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth <note>Which peace the Jews would enjoy by the death of Sennacherib.</note> peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Nah.2'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.1'>
          <note>That is, Nebuchadnezzar is in readiness to destroy the Assyrians: and the Prophet derides the undertakings of the Assyrians who prepared to resist him.</note>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify [thy] power mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.2'>For the LORD hath <note>Seeing God has punished his own people Judah and Israel, he will now punish the enemies by whom he scourged them; read (Isa_10:12).</note> turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and <note>Signifying that the Israelites were utterly destroyed.</note> marred their vine branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.3'>The shield of his mighty men is made red, <note>Both to put fear into the enemy, and also that they themselves should not so soon detect blood among one another, to discourage them.</note> the valiant men [are] in scarlet: the chariots [shall be] with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and <note>Meaning their spears would shake and crash together.</note> the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.4'>The charets shall rage in the streetes: they shall runne to and fro in the hie wayes: they shall seeme like lampes: they shall shoote like the lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.5'>
          <note>Then the Assyrians will seek by all means to gather their power, but all things will fail them.</note>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.6'>The gates of the riuers shalbe opened, and the palace shall melt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.7'>And Huzzab the Queene shalbe led away captiue, and her maides shall leade her as with the voyce of doues, smiting vpon their breastes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.8'>But Nineveh [is] of <note>The Assyrians will flatter themselves and say that Nineveh is so ancient that it can never perish, and is as a fishpool, whose waters cannot be touched by those that walk on the banks. But they will be scattered, and will not look back, even if men call them.</note> old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, [shall they cry]; but none shall look back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.9'>
          <note>God commands the enemies to spoil Nineveh, and promises them infinite riches and treasures.</note>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for [there is] none end of the store [and] glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.10'>
          <note>That is, Nineveh, and the men of it will be after this manner.</note>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain [is] in all loins, and the faces <note>{{See Joe_2:6}}</note> of them all gather blackness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.11'>Where [is] the <note>Meaning, Nineveh, whose inhabitants were cruel like the lions, and given to all oppression, and spared no violence or tyranny to provide for their wives and children.</note> dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, [even] the old lion, walked, [and] the lion's whelp, and none made [them] afraid?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.12'>The lyon did teare in pieces ynough for his whelpes, and woryed for his lyonesse, and filled his holes with praye, and his dennes with, spoyle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.2.13'>Behold, I [am] against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the <note>That is, as soon as my wrath begins to burn.</note> smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy <note>Signifying the heralds, who were accustomed to proclaim war. Some read, «of you gum teeth», with which Nineveh was accustomed to bruise the bones of the poor.</note> messengers shall no more be heard.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Nah.3'>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.1'>Woe to the bloody city! it [is] all full of lies [and] robbery; <note>It never ceases to spoil and rob.</note> the prey departeth not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.2'>The noise of a whip, <note>He shows how the Chaldeans will hasten, and how courageous their horses will be in beating the ground when they come against the Assyrians.</note> and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.3'>The horseman lifteth vp both the bright sword, and the glittering speare, and a multitude is slaine, and the dead bodyes are many: there is none ende of their corpses: they stumble vpon their corpses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.4'>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured <note>He compares Nineveh to a harlot, who by her beauty and subtilty entices young men, and brings them to destruction.</note> harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.5'>Beholde, I come vpon thee, saith the Lorde of hostes, and will discouer thy skirtes vpon thy face, and will shewe the nations thy filthines, &amp; the kingdomes thy shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.6'>And I will cast filth vpon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gasing stocke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.7'>And it shall come to passe, that al they that looke vpon thee, shall flee from thee, and say, Nineueh is destroyed, who will haue pitie vpon her? where shall I seeke comforters for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.8'>Art thou better than populous <note>Meaning Alexandria, which had a compact of peace with so many nations, and yet was now destroyed.</note> No, that was situate among the rivers, [that had] the waters round about it, whose rampart [was] the sea, [and] her wall [was] from the sea?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.9'>Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and there was none ende: Put and Lubim were her helpers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.10'>Yet was she caried awaye, and went into captiuitie: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streetes: and they cast lottes for her noble men, and al her myghtie men were bound in chaines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.11'>Also thou shalt bee drunken: thou shalt hide thy selfe, and shalt seeke helpe because of the enemie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.12'>All thy strong cities shall be like figtrees with the first ripe figs: for if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.13'>Beholde, thy people within thee are women: the gates of thy land shalbe opened vnto thine enemies, and ye fire shall deuoure thy barres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.14'>Drawe thee waters for the siege: fortifie thy strong holdes: go into the clay, and temper the morter: make strong bricke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.15'>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the <note>Signifying that God's judgments would suddenly destroy the Assyrians, as these vermin do with rain or change of weather.</note> cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.16'>Thou hast multiplied thy marchantes aboue the starres of heauen: the locust spoileth and flyeth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.17'>Thy princes are as the grashoppers, and thy captaines as the great grashoppers which remaine in the hedges in the colde day: but when the sunne ariseth, they flee away and their place is not knowen where they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.18'>Thy <note>Your princes and counsellors.</note> shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell [in the dust]: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Nah.3.19'>[There is] no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon <note>Meaning that the Assyrians had done hurt to all people.</note> whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</verse>
