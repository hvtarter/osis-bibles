      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How doth <note>The prophet wonders at the great judgment of God, seeing Jerusalem, which was so strong and so full of people, to be now destroyed and desolate.</note> the city sit desolate, [that was] full of people! [how] is she become as a widow! she [that was] great among the nations, <note>Who had chief rule over many provinces and countries.</note> [and] princess among the provinces, [how] is she become a slave!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weepeth bitterly in the <note>So that she takes no rest.</note> night, and her tears [are] on her cheeks: among all her <note>Meaning the Egyptians and Assyrians who promised help.</note> lovers she hath none to comfort [her]: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah is gone into captivity because <note>For her cruelty toward the poor and oppression of servants, (Jer_34:11).</note> of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her in the midst of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come <note>As they used to come up with mirth and joy, (Psa_42:4).</note> to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she [is] in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries <note>That is, have rule over her, (Deu_28:41).</note> are the head, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed: her princes are become <note>As men pined away with sorrow and that have no courage.</note> like harts [that] find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people <note>In her misery she considered the great benefits and commodities that she had lost.</note> fell into the hand of the enemy, and none helped her: the adversaries saw her, [and] mocked at her <note>At her religion and serving of God, which was the greatest grief to the godly.</note> sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Ierusalem hath grieuously sinned, therefore shee is in derision: all that honoured her, despise her, because they haue seene her filthinesse: yea, she sigheth and turneth backeward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>
          <note>She is not ashamed of her sin, although it is revealed.</note>Her filthiness [is] in her skirts; she remembereth not her latter end; therefore she hath been wonderfully abased: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified [himself].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen [that] the nations entered into her sanctuary, whom <note>God forbids the Ammonites and Moabites to enter into the congregation of the Lord, and under them he comprehends all enemies, (Deu_23:3).</note> thou didst command [that] they should not enter into thy congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people sigh and seeke their bread: they haue giuen their pleasant thinges for meate to refresh the soule: see, O Lorde, and consider: for I am become vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>[Is it] nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there is any <note>Thus Jerusalem laments moving others to pity her and to learn by her example.</note> sorrow like my sorrow, which hath fallen upon me, with which the LORD hath afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From above hath <note>This declares that we should acknowledge God to be the author of all our afflictions to the intent that we might seek him for remedy.</note> he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate [and] faint all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The <note>My heavy sins are continually before his eyes as he that ties a thing to his hand for a reminder.</note> yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are knit together, [and] come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into [their] hands, [from whom] I am not able to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty [men] in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, [as] in a <note>He has trodden them underfoot as they tread grapes in the winepress.</note> winepress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things I weepe: mine eye, euen mine eye casteth out water, because the comforter that should refresh my soule, is farre from me: my children are desolate, because the enemie preuailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, [and there is] none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, [that] his adversaries [should be] around him: Jerusalem is <note>Who because of her pollution was separate from her husband, (Lev_15:19) and was abhorred for the time.</note> as a menstruous woman among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>The Lorde is righteous: for I haue rebelled against his commandement: heare, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorowe: my virgins and my yong men are gone into captiuitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: my priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they <note>That is, they died for hunger.</note> sought their food to relieve their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Behold, O Lorde, howe I am troubled: my bowels swell: mine heart is turned within me, for I am ful of heauinesse: the sword spoyleth abroad, as death doeth at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They haue heard that I mourne, but there is none to comfort mee: all mine enemies haue heard of my trouble, and are glad, that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day, that thou hast pronounced, and they shalbe like vnto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>
          <note>Of desiring vengeance against the enemy, {{See Jer_11:20}} and {{See Jer_18:21}}</note>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do to them, as thou hast done to me for all my transgressions: for my sighs [are] many, and my heart [is] faint.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How hath the Lord <note>That is, brought her from prosperity to adversity.</note> covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, [and] cast down from <note>Has given her a most sore fall.</note> heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his <note>Alluding to the temple, or to the ark of the covenant, which was called the footstool of the Lord, because they would not set their minds so low, but lift up their heart toward the heavens.</note> footstool in the day of his anger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>The Lord hath destroyed al the habitations of Iaakob, &amp; not spared: he hath throwen downe in his wrath ye strong holds of the daughter of Iudah: he hath cast the downe to ye ground: he hath polluted the kingdome and the princes thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He hath cut off in [his] fierce anger all the <note>Meaning the glory and strength, as in (1Sa_2:1).</note> horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his <note>That is, his comfort which he was wont to send us, when our enemies oppressed us.</note> right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, [which] devoureth on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He <note>Showing that there is no remedy but destruction where God is the enemy.</note> hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all [that were] pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord was as an enemie: he hath deuoured Israel, and consumed all his palaces: hee hath destroyed his strong holdes, and hath increased in the daughter of Iudah lamentation and mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>For hee hath destroyed his Tabernacle, as a garden, hee hath destroyed his Congregation: the Lorde hath caused the feastes and Sabbathes to bee forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his wrath the King and the Priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a <note>As the people were accustomed to praising God to the solemn feasts with a loud voice, so now the enemies blaspheme him with shouting and cry.</note> noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart <note>This is a figurative speech as that was, when he said the ways lamented, (Lam_1:4) meaning that this sorrow was so great that the insensible things had their part of it.</note> and the wall to lament; they languished together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates are sunke to the grounde: he hath destroyed and broken her barres: her King and her princes are among the Gentiles: the Lawe is no more, neither can her Prophets receiue any vision from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The Elders of the daughter of Zion sit vpon the grounde, and keepe silence: they haue cast vp dust vpon their heades: they haue girded them selues with sackecloth: the virgines of Ierusalem hang downe their heades to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>Mine eyes doe saile with teares: my bowels swell: my liuer is powred vpon the earth, for the destructio of the daughter of my people, because the children and sucklings swoone in the streetes of the citie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They haue sayd to their mothers, Where is bread and drinke? when they swooned as the wounded in the streetes of the citie, and whe they gaue vp the ghost in their mothers bosome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>
          <note>Meaning that her calamity was so evident that it needed no witnesses.</note>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach [is] great like the sea: who can heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Thy prophets have <note>Because the false prophets called themselves seers, as the others were called, therefore he shows that they saw amiss because they did not reprove the people's faults, but flattered them in their sins, which was the cause of their destruction.</note> seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All that passe by the way, clap their hands at thee: they hisse and wagge their head vpon the daughter Ierusalem, saying, Is this the citie that men call, The perfection of beautie, and the ioye of the whole earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All thine enemies haue opened their mouth against thee: they hisse and gnashe the teeth, saying, Let vs deuoure it: certainely this is the day that we looked for: we haue founde and seene it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>The Lorde hath done that which he had purposed: he hath fulfilled his worde that he had determined of old time: he hath throwen downe, and not spared: hee hath caused thine enemie to reioyce ouer thee, and set vp the horne of thine aduersaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart cryed vnto the Lord, O wall of the daughter Zion, let teares runne downe like a riuer, day and night: take thee no rest, neither let the apple of thine eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry in the night: in the beginning of the watches powre out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift vp thine handes towarde him for the life of thy yong children, that faint for hunger in the corners of all the streetes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>Beholde, O Lord, and consider to whome thou hast done thus: shall the women eate their fruite, and children of a spanne long? shall the Priest and the Prophet be slaine in the Sanctuarie of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>The yong and the olde lie on the ground in the streetes: my virgins and my yong men are fallen by the sworde: thou hast slaine them in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed and not spared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Thou hast called as in a solemne daye my terrours rounde about, so that in the day of the Lordes wrath none escaped nor remained: those that I haue nourished and brought vp, hath mine enemie consumed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I [am] the man [that] hath seen <note>The prophet complains of the punishments and afflictions that he endured by the false prophets and hypocrites when he declared the destruction of Jerusalem, as in (Jer_20:1-2).</note> affliction by the rod of his wrath.</verse>
