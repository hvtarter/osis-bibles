      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In <note>The Son of God is of one and the selfsame eternity or everlastingness, and of one and the selfsame essence or nature with the Father.</note> the <note>From the beginning, as the evangelist says in (1Jo_1:1); it is as though he said that the Word did not begin to have his being when God began to make all that was made: for the Word was even then when all things that were made began to be made, and therefore he was before the beginning of all things.</note> beginning <note>Had his being.</note> was <note>This word «the» points out to us a peculiar and choice thing above all others, and puts a difference between this «Word», which is the Son of God, and the laws of God, which are also called the word of God.</note> the Word, and the Word was <note>This word «with» points out that there is a distinction of persons here.</note> with God, and the <note>This word «Word» is the first in order in the sentence, and is the subject of the sentence, and this word «God» is the latter in order, and is the predicate of the sentence.</note> Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>
          <note>The Son of God declares that his everlasting Godhead is the same as the Father's, both by the creating of all things, and also by preserving them, and especially by the excellent gifts of reason and understanding with which he has beautified man above all other creatures.</note>All <note>Paul expounds on this in (Col_1:15-16).</note> things were made by him; and <note>That is, as the Father did work, so did the Son work with him: for the Son was a fellow worker with him.</note> without him <note>Of all those things which were made, nothing was made without him.</note> was not any thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>
          <note>That is, by him: and this is spoken after the manner of the Hebrews, meaning by this that by his force and working power all life comes to the world.</note>In him <note>That is, even at that time when all things were made by him, for otherwise he would have said, «Life in him», and not «life was».</note> was life; and the life was <note>That force of reason and understanding which is kindled in our minds to acknowledge him, the author of so great a benefit.</note> the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>
          <note>The light of men is turned into darkness, but yet there is enough clearness so that they are without excuse.</note>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness <note>They could not perceive nor reach it to receive any light from it, no, they did not so much as acknowledge him.</note> comprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>
          <note>There is another more full manifestation of the Son of God, by the consideration of which men are in good time stirred up, even to John's voice, who is as it were the herald of Christ.</note>There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all [men] <note>Through John.</note> through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not <note>That light which we spoke of, that is, Christ, who alone can enlighten our darkness.</note> that Light, but [was sent] to bear witness of that Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>
          <note>When the Son of God saw that men did not acknowledge him by his works, although they were endued with understanding (which he had given to all of them), he exhibited himself unto his people to be seen by them with their physical eyes: yet not even then did they acknowledge him or receive him.</note>[That] was <note>Who alone and properly deserves to be called the light, for he shines by his own accord and borrows light from no one.</note> the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>
          <note>The person of the Word was made manifest even at that time when the world was made.</note>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came <note>The Word showed himself again when he came in the flesh.</note> unto his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>
          <note>The Son being shut out by the majority of his people, and acknowledged but by a few, regenerates those few by his own strength and power, and receives them into that honour which is common to all the children of God, that is, to be the sons of God.</note>But as many as received him, to them gave he <note>He condescended to give them this power to take them to be his children.</note> power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the <note>Of that shameful and corrupt nature of man, which is throughout the scriptures described as an enemy of the spirit.</note> will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>
          <note>That Son who is God from everlasting took upon himself man's nature, so that one and the selfsame might be both God and man, who manifestly appeared to many witnesses that saw him, amongst whom he was conversant and unto whom by sure and undoubted arguments he showed both of his natures.</note>And the Word was made <note>That is, man: so that, by the figure of speech synecdoche, the part is taken for the whole: for he took upon himself our entire nature, that is to say, a true body, and a true soul.</note> flesh, and <note>For a time, and when that was ended, he went up into heaven: for the word which he uses is used with reference to tents: and yet nonetheless he is always present with us, though not in flesh, but by the power of his spirit.</note> dwelt among us, (and we beheld his <note>The glory which he speaks of here is that manifestation of Christ's majesty, which was as it were openly placed before our eyes when the Son of God appeared in the flesh.</note> glory, the glory <note>This word «as» does not indicate here a likeness, but rather the truth of the matter, for his meaning is this, that we saw such a glory which suited and was proper for the true and only begotten Son of God, who is Lord and King over all the world.</note> as of the only begotten of the Father,) <note>He was not only a partaker of grace and truth, but was full of the very substance of grace and truth.</note> full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>
          <note>John is a faithful witness of the excellency of Christ.</note>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh <note>That is, «He before whom I am sent to prepare him the way»: so that these words refer to the time of his calling, and not of his age, for John was six months older than Christ.</note> after me is preferred <note>This sentence has in it a turning of the reason as we call it, as one would say, a setting of that first which should be last, and that last which should be first: for in plain speech it is this, «He that comes after me, is better than I am, for he was before me.» We find a similar turning of the reason in (Luk_7:47): «Many sins are forgiven her, because she loved much», which is this much to say, «She loved much, because many sins are forgiven her.»</note> before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>
          <note>Christ is the most plentiful fountain of all goodness, but he gave out his gifts most bountifully at that time when he exhibited and showed himself to the world.</note>And of his fulness have all we received, and <note>That is, grace upon grace; as one would say, graces piled one upon another.</note> grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the Lawe was giuen by Moses, but grace, and trueth came by Iesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>
          <note>The true knowledge of God proceeds only from Jesus Christ.</note>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the <note>Who is nearest to his Father, not only in respect of his love towards him, but by the bond of nature, and by means of that union or oneness that is between them, by which the Father and the Son are one.</note> bosom of the Father, he hath <note>Revealed him and showed him unto us, whereas before he was hidden under the shadows of the law, so that our minds were not able to perceive him: for whoever sees him, sees the Father also.</note> declared [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>
          <note>John is neither the Messiah, nor like any of the other prophets, but is the herald of Christ, who is now present.</note>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he <note>He did acknowledge him, and spoke of him plainly and openly.</note> confessed, and <note>This repeating of the one and the selfsame thing, though in different words, is often used by the Hebrews, and it has great force, for they used to speak one thing twice in order to set it out more certainly and plainly.</note> denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, <note>The Jews thought that Elias would come again before the days of the Messiah, and they took as the basis of their opinion (Mal_4:5), which is to be understood as referring to John, see (Mat_11:14). And yet John denies that he is Elias, answering their question just as they meant it.</note> I am not. Art thou <note>They are inquiring about some great prophet, and not about Christ, for John denied before that he is Christ, for they thought that some great prophet would be sent like Moses, using to support this position (Deu_18:15), which is to be understood to refer to all the company of the prophets and ministers, which have been and shall be to the end, and especially of Christ who is the head of all prophets.</note> that prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then said they vnto him, Who art thou, that we may giue an answere to them that sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>
          <note>Christ is the author of baptism, and not John: and therefore the authority of this does not come from John, who is the minister, but wholly from Christ the Lord.</note>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said unto him, <note>By this we may prove that the Jews knew there should be some change in religion under the Messiah.</note> Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one <note>Whom all the world sees, and sees even amongst you.</note> among you, whom ye know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He it is that commeth after me, which was before me, whose shoe latchet I am not worthie to vnloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordan, where Iohn did baptize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>
          <note>The body and truth of all the sacrifices of the law, to make satisfaction for the sin of the world, is Christ.</note>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold <note>This word «the» which is added has great force in it, not only to set forth the worthiness of Christ, and so to separate him for the «lamb» which was a symbol of him, and from all other sacrifices of the law, but also to remind us of the prophecies of Isaiah and others.</note> the Lamb of God, which <note>This word is in the present tense, and signifies a continuous act, for the Lamb rightfully has this power both now and forever to take away the sins of the world.</note> taketh away the <note>That is, that root of sins, namely, our corruption, and so consequently the fruits of sins, which are commonly called in the plural number, sins.</note> sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I saide, After me commeth a man, which was before me: for he was better then I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And <note>I never knew him by face before.</note> I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>
          <note>Christ is proved to be the Son of God by the coming down of the Holy Spirit, by the Father's voice, and by John's testimony.</note>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knewe him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, he saide vnto me, Vpon whom thou shalt see that Spirit come downe, and tary still on him, that is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw, and bare record that this is <note>This word «the» points out to us some excellent thing, and makes a distinction between Christ and others, whom Moses and the prophets commonly call the sons of the most High.</note> the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>
          <note>John gathers disciples not to himself, but to Christ.</note>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>
          <note>Christ is set before us to follow, not as a vain shadow, but as our Mediator.</note>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>
          <note>In this first gathering of the disciples we have shown to us that the beginning of salvation is from God, who calls us unto his Son by the ministry of his servants: whom, as he guides us, we must also hear, and follow him home, so that being instructed by him we may also instruct others.</note>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) <note>Where is your lodging?</note> where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the <note>It was getting later in the night.</note> tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrewe, Simon Peters brother, was one of the two which had heard it of Iohn, and that followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the <note>That is, anointed, and king after the manner of the Jewish people.</note> Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Iesus; Iesus behelde him, and saide, Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The day following, Iesus woulde goe into Galile, and founde Philip, and said vnto him, Followe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Nowe Philip was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrewe and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>
          <note>God uses the good endeavours of the unlearned such that he makes them teachers of the learned.</note>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>
          <note>We must especially take heed of false presumptions, which prevent us from entrance to Christ.</note>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>
          <note>Simple uprightness discerns the true Israelites from the false.</note>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>
          <note>The purpose of miracles is to set before us Christ the Almighty, and also the only author of our salvation, in order that we may apprehend him by faith.</note>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered, and saide vnto him, Rabbi, thou art that Sonne of God: thou art that King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Iesus answered, and sayde vnto him, Because I sayde vnto thee, I sawe thee vnder the figtree, beleeuest thou? thou shalt see greater things then these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God <note>These words signify the power of God which would appear in Christ's ministry by the angels serving him as the head of the Church.</note> ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And <note>Christ, declaring openly in an assembly by a notable miracle that he has power over the nature of things to feed man's body, leads the minds of all men to consider his spiritual and saving strength and power.</note> the <note>After the talk which he had with Nathanael, or after his departure from John, or after he came into Galilee.</note> third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Iesus was called also, and his disciples vnto the mariage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>
          <note>Christ takes good enough care of our salvation, and therefore has no need of others to remind of it.</note>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine <note>My appointed time.</note> hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saide vnto the seruants, Whatsoeuer he sayeth vnto you, doe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were set there six <note>These were vessels made for the use of water, in which they washed themselves.</note> waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three <note>Every firkin contained one hundred pounds, at twelve ounces a pound: By this we gather that Christ helps them with one thousand and eight hundred pounds of wine. (about 135 imperial gallons or 600 litres Ed.)</note> firkins apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>And Iesus sayde vnto them, Fill the waterpots with water. Then they filled them vp to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then he sayde vnto them, Draw out nowe and beare vnto the gouernour of the feast. So they bare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>Nowe when the gouernour of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, (for he knewe not whence it was: but the seruants, which drewe the water, knewe) the gouernour of ye feast called the bridegrome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have <note>Literally, «are drunken». Now this saying, to be drunken, does not always refer to being drunk in the evil sense in the Hebrew language, but sometimes signifies an abundant and plentiful use of wine, which is nonetheless a measured amount, as in (Gen_43:34).</note> well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana a towne of Galile, and shewed forth his glorie: and his disciples beleeued on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his <note>That is, his cousins.</note> brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>
          <note>Christ being made subject to the law for us, satisfies the law of the passover.</note>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>
          <note>Christ being ordained to purge the Church with great zeal begins his office both of Priest and Prophet.</note>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>Then hee made a scourge of small cordes, and draue them all out of the Temple with the sheepe and oxen, and powred out the changers money, and ouerthrewe the tables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And said vnto them that solde doues, Take these things hence: make not my fathers house, an house of marchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The <note>«Zeal» in this place is taken for a wrathful indignation and displeasure of the mind, brought about when someone deals wickedly and evilly towards those whom we love well.</note> zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>
          <note>Against those who so bind God to an ordinary calling, which they themselves most shamefully abuse, that they will not admit of an extraordinary calling, which God confirms from heaven (and they would have it extinguished, although in vain) unless it is sealed with outward and bodily miracles.</note>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What <note>With what miracle do you confirm it, that we may see the heavenly power and strength which gives you authority to speak and to act in this manner?</note> sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Destroy this Temple, and in three daies I will raise it vp againe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.17.1'>These <note>Jesus Christ, the everlasting high Priest, being ready to immediately offer himself up, by solemn prayers consecrates himself to God the Father as a sacrifice, and us together with himself. Therefore this prayer was from the beginning, is, and will be to the end of the world, the foundation and ground of the Church of God.</note> words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, <note>He first declares that as he came into the world so that the Father might show in him (being apprehended by faith) his glory in saving his elect, so he applied himself to that only: and therefore he desires from the Father that he would bless the work which he had finished.</note> Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.2'>As thou hast given him power over <note>Over all men.</note> all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.3'>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the <note>He calls the Father the only true God in order to set him against all false gods, and to include himself and the Holy Spirit, for he immediately joins the knowledge of the Father and the knowledge of himself together, and according to his accustomed manner sets forth the whole Godhead in the person of the Father. So is the Father alone said to be King, immortal, wise, dwelling in light which no man can attain unto, and invisible; (Rom_16:27; 1Ti_1:17).</note> only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.4'>I haue glorified thee on the earth: I haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.5'>And nowe glorifie me, thou Father, with thine owne selfe, with the glorie which I had with thee before the world was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.6'>
          <note>First of all he prays for his disciples by whom he would have the rest of his disciples gathered together, and commends them unto the Father (having already rejected the whole company of the reprobate) because he received them from his Father into his custody, and because by embracing his doctrine, they will have so many and so mighty enemies, that there is no way for them to be in safety, except by his help.</note>I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: <note>He shows by this the everlasting election and choice, which was hidden in the good will and pleasure of God, which is the groundwork of our salvation.</note> thine they were, and thou <note>He shows that the everlasting and hidden purpose of God is declared in Christ, by whom we are justified and sanctified, if we lay hold of him by faith, so that we may eventually come to the glory of the election.</note> gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.7'>Nowe they knowe that all things whatsoeuer thou hast giuen me, are of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.8'>For I haue giuen vnto them the wordes which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowen surely that I came out from thee, &amp; haue beleeued that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.9'>I pray for them: I pray not for the worlde, but for them which thou hast giuen me: for they are thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.10'>And al mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.11'>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be <note>He prays that his people may peaceably agree and be joined together in one, that as the Godhead is one, so they may be of one mind and one consent together.</note> one, as we [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.12'>While I was with them in the worlde, I kept them in thy Name: those that thou gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them is lost, but the childe of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.13'>And now come I to thee, and these things speake I in the worlde, that they might haue my ioy fulfilled in themselues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.14'>I haue giuen them thy word, &amp; the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.15'>
          <note>He shows what type of deliverance he means: not that they should be in no danger, but that in being preserved from all they might prove by experience that the doctrine of salvation is true, which doctrine they received from his mouth to deliver to others.</note>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.16'>They are not of the worlde, as I am not of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.17'>
          <note>That is, make them holy: and that thing is said to be holy which is dedicated to God and belongs to him alone.</note>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.18'>
          <note>Moreover, he adds that the apostles have a calling common with him, and therefore that they must be held up by the very same virtue to give themselves up wholly to God, by which Christ, who was first, did consecrate himself to the Father.</note>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.19'>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the <note>The true and substantial sanctification of Christ is contrasted with the outward purifyings of the law.</note> truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.20'>
          <note>Secondly, he offers to God the Father all of his, that is, all those who will believe in him by the doctrine of the apostles: that as he cleaves unto the Father, receiving from him all fulness, so they being joined with him may receive life from him, and being loved together in him, may also with him eventually enjoy everlasting glory.</note>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.21'>That they all may bee one, as thou, O Father, art in me, and I in thee: euen that they may be also one in vs, that the worlde may beleeue that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.22'>And the glory that thou gauest me, I haue giuen them, that they may be one, as we are one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.23'>I in them, and thou in mee, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the worlde may knowe that thou hast sent mee, and hast loued them, as thou hast loued me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.24'>Father, I will that they which thou hast giuen me, be with me euen where I am, that they may beholde that my glorie, which thou hast giuen mee: for thou louedst me before the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.25'>O righteous Father, the worlde also hath not knowen thee, but I haue knowen thee, and these haue knowen, that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.17.26'>
          <note>He communicates the knowledge of the Father with his own little by little, which knowledge is most full in Christ the mediator, that they may in him be beloved by the Father, with the selfsame love with which he loves the Son.</note>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare [it]: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.18'>
        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When <note>Christ goes of his own accord into a garden, which his betrayer knew, to be taken, so that by his obedience he might take away the sin that entered into the world by one man's rebellion, and that in a garden.</note> Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>And Iudas which betraied him, knewe also the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>
          <note>Christ who was innocent was taken as a wicked person, that we who are wicked might be let go as innocent.</note>Judas then, having received a band [of men] and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>
          <note>Christ's person (but not his power) was bound by his adversaries, but only when and how he desired.</note>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus sayde vnto them, I am hee. Nowe Iudas also which betraied him, stoode with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>Assoone then as hee had saide vnto them, I am hee, they went away backewardes, and fell to the grounde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Then he asked them againe, Whome seeke yee? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>
          <note>Christ does not neglect the office of a good pastor, not even in his greatest danger.</note>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>This was that the worde might be fulfilled which hee spake, Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>
          <note>We ought to contain our zeal for God within the bounds of our calling.</note>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Then sayde Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sworde into the sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe which my Father hath giuen me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the bande and the captaine, and the officers of the Iewes tooke Iesus, and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>
          <note>Christ is brought before an earthly high priest to be condemned for our blasphemies, that we might be acquitted by the everlasting high Priest himself.</note>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>And Caiaphas was he, that gaue counsel to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>
          <note>A graphic example of the fragility of men, even the best of them, when they are left to themselves.</note>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out the other disciple which was knowen vnto the hie Priest, and spake to her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then saide the maide that kept the doore, vnto Peter, Art not thou also one of this mans disciples? He sayd, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>And the seruants and officers stoode there, which had made a fire of coles: for it was colde, &amp; they warmed themselues; Peter also stood among them, and warmed himselfe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>
          <note>Christ defends his cause, but only slightly, not that he would withdraw himself from death, but to show that he was condemned as someone who was innocent.</note>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world: I euer taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes resort continually, and in secret haue I sayde nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why askest thou mee? aske them which heard mee what I sayde vnto them: beholde, they knowe what I sayd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had spoken these thinges, one of the officers which stoode by, smote Iesus with his rod, saying, Answerest thou the hie Priest so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Iesus answered him, If I haue euill spoken, beare witnes of the euil: but if I haue well spoken, why smitest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Nowe Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the hie Priest)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>
          <note>After men have once fallen, they cannot only not lift themselves up by their own strength, but also they fall more and more into a worse condition, until they are raised up again by a new power from God.</note>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also [one] of his disciples? He denied [it], and said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the seruaunts of the hie Priest, his cousin whose eare Peter smote off, saide, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crewe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>
          <note>The Son of God is brought before the judgment seat of an earthly and profane man, in whom there is found much less wickedness than in the rulers of the people of God. A graphic image of the wrath of God against sin, and in addition of his great mercy, and last of all of his most severe judgment against the stubborn condemners of his grace when it is offered unto them.</note>Then led they Jesus from <note>From Caiaphas' house.</note> Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring yee against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered, and saide vnto him, If hee were not an euill doer, we woulde not haue deliuered him vnto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, <note>For judgments of life and death were taken from them forty years before the destruction of the temple.</note> It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, <note>For Christ had foretold that he would be crucified.</note> signifying what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>So Pilate entred into the common hall againe, and called Iesus, and sayde vnto him, Art thou the king of the Iewes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Iesus answered him, Saiest thou that of thy selfe, or did other tell it thee of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Iewe? Thine owne nation, and the hie Priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me. What hast thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>
          <note>Christ affirms his spiritual kingdom, but rejects a worldly one.</note>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate then said vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King: for this cause am I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnes vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth, heareth my voyce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>
          <note>It was required that Christ should be pronounced innocent, but nonetheless, in that he took upon himself our person, he was to be condemned as a most wicked man.</note>Pilate saith unto him, <note>He speaks this disdainfully and scoffingly, and not by way of asking a question.</note> What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault [at all].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you haue a custome, that I shoulde deliuer you one loose at the Passeouer: will yee then that I loose vnto you the King of ye Iewes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then <note>Literally, «made a great and foul voice».</note> cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and <note>The wisdom of the flesh chooses the least of two evils, but God curses that very wisdom.</note> scourged [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>And saide, Haile, King of the Iewes; they smote him with their roddes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>
          <note>Christ is again acquitted by the same mouth with which he was afterwards condemned.</note>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then came Iesus foorth wearing a crowne of thornes, and a purple garment; Pilate said vnto them, Beholde the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, <note>They will have him crucified whom, by an old custom of theirs, they should have stoned and hanged up as convicted of blasphemy: but they desire to have him crucified after the manner of the Romans.</note> Crucify [him], crucify [him]. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify [him]: for I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Iewes answered him, We haue a lawe, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himselfe the Sonne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>
          <note>Pilate's conscience fights for Christ, but it immediately yields, because it is not upheld with the singular power of God.</note>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And went againe into the common hall, and saide vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then saide Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, &amp; haue power to loose thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therefore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From thence foorth Pilate sought to loose him, but the Iewes cried, saying, If thou deliuer him, thou art not Cesars friende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a King, speaketh against Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>
          <note>Pilate condemns himself first, with the same mouth with which he afterwards condemns Christ.</note>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, <note>«Gabbatha» signifies a high place, as judgment seats are.</note> Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the Preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and hee sayde vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate sayde vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The high Priestes answered, We haue no King but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>
          <note>Christ fastens Satan, sin, and death to the cross.</note>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led [him] away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he bare his owne crosse, and came into a place named of dead mens Skulles, which is called in Hebrewe, «Golgotha»:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>
          <note>Christ, sitting upon the throne of the cross, is publicly proclaimed everlasting King of all people by the hand of him who condemned him for usurping a kingdom.</note>And Pilate wrote a title, and put [it] on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was neere to the citie: and it was written in Hebrewe, Greeke and Latine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then saide the hie Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Iewes, but that he sayd, I am King of the Iewes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>
          <note>Christ signifies by the division of his garments amongst the bloody butchers (except for his coat which had no seam) that it will come to pass, that he will shortly divide his benefits, and enrich his very enemies throughout the world: but in such a way that the treasure of his Church will remain whole.</note>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also [his] coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>Therefore they sayde one to another, Let vs not deuide it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which sayth, They parted my garments among them, and on my coate did cast lots. So the souldiers did these things in deede.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>
          <note>Christ is a perfect example of all righteousness, not only in the keeping of the first, but also of the second table of the ten commandments.</note>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>And when Iesus sawe his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he said vnto his mother, Woman, beholde thy sonne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then saide he to the disciple, Beholde thy mother: and from that houre, the disciple tooke her home vnto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>
          <note>Christ when he has taken the vinegar, yields up the Spirit, indeed drinking up in our name that most bitter and severe cup of his Father's wrath.</note>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now there was set a <note>Galatinus witnesses out of the book called Sanhedrin that the Jews often gave those who were executed vinegar mixed with frankincense to drink, to make them somewhat delirious: so the Jews provided charitably for the poor men's conscience who were executed.</note> vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put [it] upon hyssop, and put [it] to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Nowe when Iesus had receiued of the vineger, he saide, It is finished, and bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>
          <note>The body of Christ which was dead for a season (because it so pleased him) is wounded, but not the least bone of it is broken: and such is the state of his resurrection body.</note>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then came the souldiers and brake the legges of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with Iesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead alreadie, they brake not his legges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>
          <note>Christ, being dead upon the cross, witnesses by a double sign that he alone is the true satisfaction, and the true washing for the believers.</note>But one of the soldiers with a spear <note>This wound was a most manifest witness of the death of Christ: for the water that issued out by this wound shows us plainly that the weapon pierced the very skin that encompasses the heart, and this skin is the vessel that contains the water; and once that is wounded, the creature which is so pierced and stricken has no choice but to die.</note> pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that sawe it, bare recorde, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might beleeue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shalbe broken.</verse>
