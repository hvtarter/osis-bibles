      <chapter osisID='Mal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.1'>The <note>{{See Isa_13:1}}</note> burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. <note>The Argument - This Prophet was one of the three who God raised up for the comfort of the Church after the captivity, and after him there was no one else until John the Baptist was sent, which was either a token of God's wrath, or an admonition that they should with more fervent desires look for the coming of the Messiah. He confirms the same doctrine, that the two former do: chiefly he reproves the priests for their covetousness, and because they served God after their own fantasies, and not according to the direction of his word. He also notes certain distinct sins, which were then among them, such as the marrying of idolatrous and many wives, murmurings against God, impatience, and things such as these. Nonetheless, for the comfort of the godly he declares that God would not forget his promise made to their fathers, but would send Christ his messenger, in whom the covenant would be accomplished, whose coming would be terrible to the wicked, and bring all consolation and joy to the godly.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.2'>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, <note>Which declares their great ingratitude that did not acknowledge this love, which was so evident, in that he chose Abraham from out of all the world, and next chose Jacob the younger brother from whom they came, and left Esau the elder.</note> Wherein hast thou loved us? [Was] not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.3'>And I <note>For besides this the signs of my hatred appeared even when he was made servant to his younger brother, being yet in his mother's belly, and also afterward in that he was put from his birthright. Yet even now before your eyes the signs of this are evident, in that his country lies waste, and he will never return to inhabit it.</note> hated Esau, <note>Whereas you my people, whom the enemy hated more than them, are by my grace and love towards you delivered; read (Rom_9:13).</note> and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.4'>Though Edom say, wee are impouerished, but we will returne and build the desolate places, yet sayeth the Lorde of hostes, they shall builde, but I will destroy it, and they shall call them, The border of wickednes, and the people, with whome the Lord is angrie for euer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.5'>And your eyes shall see it, and yee shall say, The Lorde will be magnified vpon the border of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.6'>A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I [be] a father, where [is] mine honour? and if I [be] a master, where [is] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, <note>Besides the rest of the people he mainly condemns the priests, because they should have reproved others for their hypocrisy, and for not yielding to God, and should not have hardened them by their example to do greater evils.</note> O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, <note>He notes their great hypocrisy, who would not see their faults, but most impudently covered them, and so were blind guides.</note> Wherein have we despised thy name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.7'>Ye offer <note>You receive all types of offerings for your own greediness, and do not examine whether they are according to my Law or not.</note> polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] <note>Not that they said this, but by their doings they declared it.</note> contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.8'>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] <note>You make it no fault: and by this he condemns them that think it sufficient to serve God partly as he has commanded, and partly after man's fantasy, and so do not come to the pureness of religion, which he requires. And therefore in reproach he shows them that a mortal man would not be content to be served in such a way.</note> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.9'>And now, I pray you, <note>He derides the priests who deceived the people in saying that they prayed for them, and shows that they were the occasion that these evils came upon the people.</note> beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard <note>Will God consider your office and state, seeing you are so covetous and wicked?</note> your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.10'>Who [is there] even among you <note>Because the Levites who kept the doors did not test whether the sacrifices that came in were according to the Law, God wishes that they would rather shut the doors, than to receive such as were not perfect.</note> that would shut the doors [for nought]? neither do ye kindle [fire] on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.11'>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name [shall be] <note>God shows that their ingratitude and neglect of his true service will be the cause of the calling of the Gentiles: and here the Prophet that was under the Law, used words that the people would understand, and by the altar and sacrifice he means the spiritual service of God, which should be under the Gospel, when an end would be made to all these legal ceremonies by Christ's sacrifice alone.</note> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.12'>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, <note>Both the priests and the people were infected with this error, that they did not regard what was offered: for they thought that God was as well content with the lean, as with the fat. But in the meantime they did not show the obedience to God which he required, and so committed impiety, and also showed their contempt of God, and covetousness.</note> The table of the LORD [is] polluted; and the fruit thereof, [even] his meat, [is] contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.13'>Ye said also, Behold, what a <note>The priests and people were both weary with serving God, and did not regard what manner of sacrifice and service they gave to God: for that which was least profitable, was thought good enough for the Lord.</note> weariness [is it]! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.1.14'>But cursed [be] the deceiver, which hath in his flock <note>That is, has ability to serve the Lord according to his word, and yet will serve him according to his covetous mind.</note> a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I [am] a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name [is] dreadful among the heathen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.1'>And now, O ye <note>He speaks mainly to them, but under them he includes the people also.</note> priests, this commandment [is] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.2'>If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay [it] to heart, to give glory <note>To serve me according to my word.</note> unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your <note>That is, the abundance of God's benefits.</note> blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay [it] to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.3'>Behold, I will corrupt <note>The seed you sow will come to no profit.</note> your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, [even] the <note>You boast of your holiness, sacrifices, and feasts, but they will turn to your shame and be as vile as dung.</note> dung of your solemn feasts; and [one] shall take you away with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.4'>And ye shall know that I have <note>The Priests objected against the Prophet that he could not remove them without speaking against the priesthood, and the office established by God by promise. But he shows that the office is nothing slandered, when these villains and dung are called by their own names.</note> sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.5'>My <note>He shows what were the two conditions of the covenant made with the tribe of Levi on God's part, that he would give them long life and felicity, and on their part, that they should faithfully serve him according to his word.</note> covenant was with him of life and peace; and I <note>I commanded Levi a certain law to serve me.</note> gave them to him [for] the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before <note>He served me and set forth my glory with all humility and submission.</note> my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.6'>The law of <note>He shows that the priests ought to have knowledge to instruct others in the word of the Lord.</note> truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.7'>For the priest's <note>He is as the treasure house of God's word, and ought to give to everyone according to their need, and not to reserve it for himself.</note> lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he [is] the <note>Showing that whoever does not declare God's will, is not his messenger, and priest.</note> messenger of the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.8'>But yee are gone out of the way: yee haue caused many to fall by the Lawe: yee haue broken the couenant of Leui, sayeth the Lord of hostes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.9'>Therefore haue I also made you to be despised, and vile before all the people, because yee kept not my wayes, but haue beene partiall in the Lawe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.10'>Have we not all one <note>The Prophet accuses the ingratitude of the Jews toward God and man: for seeing they were all born of one father Abraham, as God had elected them to be his holy people, they ought neither to offend God nor their brethren.</note> father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of <note>By which they had bound themselves to God to be a holy people.</note> our fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.11'>Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the <note>They have united themselves in marriage with those that are of another religion.</note> daughter of a strange god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.12'>The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that <note>That is, the priest.</note> offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.13'>And this have ye done again, <note>Yet cause the people to lament, because God does not regard their sacrifices, so that they seem to sacrifice in vain.</note> covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth [it] with good will at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.14'>Yet ye say, <note>This is another fault, of which he accuses them, that is, that they broke the laws of marriage.</note> Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet [is] she thy <note>As the one half of yourself.</note> companion, and the wife of thy <note>She that was united to you by a solemn covenant, and by the invocation of God's name.</note> covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.15'>And did not <note>Did not God make man and woman as one flesh and not many?</note> he make one? Yet had he the <note>By his power and strength he could have made many women for one man.</note> residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly <note>Those who should be born in lawful and moderate marriage, in which is no excess of lusts.</note> seed. Therefore take heed to your <note>Contain yourselves within your bounds, and be sober in mind, and bridle your affections.</note> spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.16'>For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he <note>Not that he allows divorce, but of two faults he shows which is the less.</note> hateth putting away: for [one] covereth <note>He thinks it sufficient to keep his wife still, even though he takes others, and so as it were covers his fault.</note> violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.2.17'>Ye have <note>You murmur against God, because he did not hear you as soon as you called.</note> wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied [him]? When ye say, Every one that doeth <note>In thinking that God favoured the wicked, and had no respect for those that serve him.</note> evil [is] good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where [is] the God of <note>Thus they blasphemed God in condemning his power and justice, because he did not judge according to their imaginings.</note> judgment?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.1'>Behold, I will send my <note>This is meant of John the Baptist, as Christ interprets it; (Luk_7:27).</note> messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the <note>Meaning, the Messiah, as in (Psa_40:17; Dan_9:17, Dan_9:25).</note> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the <note>That is, Christ, by whom the covenant was made and ratified, who is called the angel or messenger of the covenant, because he reconciles us to his Father, and is Lord or King, because he has the rule of his Church.</note> messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.2'>But who <note>He shows that the hypocrites who wish so much for the Lord's coming will not remain when he draws near: for he will consume them, and purge his own and make them clean.</note> may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he [is] like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.3'>And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of <note>He begins at the priests, that they might be lights, and shine unto others.</note> Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.4'>Then shall the offerings of Iudah and Ierusalem be acceptable vnto the Lord, as in old time and in the yeeres afore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.5'>And I will come neere to you to iudgement, and I will be a swift witnesse against the southsayers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that wrongfully keepe backe the hirelings wages, and vexe the widowe, and the fatherlesse, and oppresse the stranger, and feare not me, sayth the Lord of hostes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.6'>For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob <note>They murmured against God, because they did not see his help which was ever present to defend them: and therefore he accuses them of ingratitude, and shows that in that they are not daily consumed, it is a sign that he still defends them, and so his mercy towards them never changes.</note> are not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.7'>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept [them]. <note>Read (Zec_1:3).</note> Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.8'>Will a <note>There are none of the heathen so barbarous, that will defraud their gods of their honour, or deal deceitfully with them.</note> man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In <note>By which the service of God should have been maintained, and the priests and the poor relieved.</note> tithes and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.9'>Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye haue spoyled me, euen this whole nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.10'>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, <note>Not having respect how much you need, but I will give you in all abundance, so that you will lack place to put my blessings in.</note> that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.11'>And I will rebuke the <note>Meaning the caterpillar, and whatever destroys corn and fruits.</note> devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.12'>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a pleasant lande, sayeth the Lorde of hostes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.13'>Your words have been stout <note>The Prophet condemns them of double blasphemy against God: first, in that they said that God had no respect for those that served him, and next, that the wicked were more in his favour than the godly.</note> against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken [so much] against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.14'>Ye haue saide, It is in vaine to serue God: and what profite is it that we haue kept his commandement, and that we walked humbly before the Lord of hostes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.15'>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, [they that] tempt God are even <note>They are not only preferred to honour, but also delivered from dangers.</note> delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.16'>
          <note>After these admonitions of the Prophet, some were strongly touched, and encouraged others to fear God.</note>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a <note>Both because the thing was strange that some turned to God in that great and universal corruption, and also that this might be an example of God's mercies to all repentant sinners.</note> book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.17'>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day <note>When I will restore my Church according to my promise, they will be as my own proper goods.</note> when I make up my jewels; and I will <note>That is, forgive their sins, and govern them with my Spirit.</note> spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.3.18'>Then shall you returne, and discerne betweene the righteous and wicked, betweene him that serueth God, and him that serueth him not.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.1'>For, behold, the day cometh, that shall <note>He prophesies of God's judgments against the wicked, who would not receive Christ, when God would send him for the restoration of his Church.</note> burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.2'>But unto you that fear my name shall the <note>Meaning, Christ, who with his wings or beams of his grace would enlighten and comfort his Church; (Eph_5:14). And he is called the «Sun of righteousness», because in himself he has all perfection, and also the justice of the Father dwells in him: by which he regenerates us to righteousness, cleanses us from the filth of this world, and reforms us to the image of God.</note> Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go <note>You will be set at liberty, and increase in the joy of the Spirit; (2Co_3:17).</note> forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.3'>And ye shall treade downe the wicked: for they shall be dust vnder the soles of your feete in the day that I shall doe this, sayeth the Lorde of hostes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.4'>
          <note>Because the time had come that the Jews would be destitute of Prophets until the time of Christ, because they should with more fervent minds desire his coming, the Prophet exhorts them to exercise themselves diligently in studying the Law of Moses in the meantime, by which they might continue in the true religion, and also be armed against all temptations.</note>Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, [with] the statutes and judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mal.4.5'>Behold, I will send you <note>This Christ interprets of John the Baptist, who both for his zeal, and restoring or religion, is aptly compared to Elijah; (Mat_11:13-14).</note> Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and <note>Which as it is true for the wicked, so does it waken the godly, and call them to repentance.</note> dreadful day of the LORD:</verse>
