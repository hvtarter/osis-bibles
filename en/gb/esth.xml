      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of <note>Also called Darius, who was now the favourite monarch and had the government of the Medes, Persians and Chaldeans. Some think he was Darius Hystaspis also called Artaxerxes.</note> Ahasuerus, (this [is] Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, [over] an <note>(Dan_6:1) makes mention of only 120 leaving out the number that are imperfect as the scripture uses in various places.</note> hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) <note>The Argument - Because of the variety of names, by which they used to call their kings, and the number of years in which the Hebrews and the Greeks vary, various authors write concerning that Ahasuerus but is seems in (Dan_6:1, Dan_9:1) that he was Darius king of the Medes and son of Astyages also called Ahasuerus which was a name of honour and signified great and chief as chief head. In this is declared the great mercies of God toward his church: who never fails them in their greatest dangers, but when all hope of worldly help fades, he stirs up some, by whom he sends comfort and deliverance. In this also is described the ambition, pride and cruelty of the wicked when they come to honour and their sudden fall when they are at their highest and how God preserves and prefers them who are zealous of his glory and have a care and love for their brethren.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>[That] in those days, when the king Ahasuerus <note>That is, had rest and quietness.</note> sat on the throne of his kingdom, which [was] in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>In the third yeere of his reigne, he made a feast vnto all his princes and his seruants, euen the power of Persia and Media, and to the captaines and gouernours of the prouinces which were before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>That he might shewe the riches &amp; glorie of his kingdome, and the honour of his great maiestie many dayes, euen an hundreth and foure score dayes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these dayes were expired, the King made a feast to all the people that were founde in the palace of Shushan, both vnto great and small, seuen dayes, in the court of the garden of the Kings palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>[Where were] white, green, and blue, [hangings], fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the <note>Which they used in those countries instead of tables.</note> beds [were of] gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave [them] drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the <note>As was befitting for so magnificent a king.</note> state of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking [was] according to the law; none did <note>No one was forced to drink more than it pleased him.</note> compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>The Queene Vashti made a feast also for the women in the royall house of King Ahashuerosh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the <note>Which was the last day of the feast that the king made for the people as in (Est_1:5).</note> seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>To bring Queene Vashti before the King with the crowne royall, that he might shewe the people and the princes her beautie: for shee was fayre to looke vpon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But the Queene Vashti refused to come at the Kings worde, which he had giuen in charge to the eunuches: therefore the King was very angry, and his wrath kindled in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men, <note>Who had experience in things as they had learned by diligent marking in continuance of time.</note> which knew the times, (for so [was] the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>And the next unto him [was] Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, [and] Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the <note>Who were his chief counsellors that always had access to him.</note> king's face, [and] which sat the first in the kingdom;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shal we do vnto the Queene Vashti according to the law, because she did not according to the worde of the King Ahashuerosh by the commission of the eunuches?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done <note>By her disobedience she has given an example to all women to do the same to their husbands.</note> wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that [are] in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For [this] <note>That is, her disobedience.</note> deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>[Likewise] shall the <note>Meaning, that they would take the first opportunity to do the same and the rest of the women would also do the same.</note> ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus [shall there arise] too much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come <note>Let her be divorced and another made queen.</note> no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is <note>For he had under him a hundred and twenty-seven countries.</note> great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And this saying pleased the King and the princes, and the King did according to the worde of Memucan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should <note>That is, that the wife should be subject to the husband and at his commandment.</note> bear rule in his own house, and that [it] should be published according to the language of every people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he <note>That is, he brought the matter again into discussion.</note> remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed <note>By the seven wise men of his counsel.</note> against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>And the Kings seruants that ministred vnto him, sayd, Let them seeke for the King beautifull yong virgins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, <note>The abuse of these countries was so great, that they invented many means to serve the lusts of princes and therefore they ordained wicked laws that the king might have whose daughters he would. They had many houses appointed, one for the virgins, another for the concubines and another for the queen.</note> keeper of the women; and let their things <note>Read what this purification was in (Est_2:12).</note> for purification be given [them]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And the mayde that shall please the King, let her reigne in the steade of Vashti; this pleased the King, and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>In the citie of Shushan, there was a certaine Iewe, whose name was Mordecai the sonne of Iair, the sonne of Shimei, the sonne of Kish a man of Iemini,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>Which had bene caryed away from Ierusalem with the captiuitie that was caryed away with Ieconiah King of Iudah (whom Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babel had caryed away)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he nourished Hadassah, that is Ester, his vncles daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, &amp; the mayde was fayre, and beautifull to looke on: &amp; after the death of her father, and her mother, Mordecai tooke her for his own daughter</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>And when the Kings commandement, and his decree was published, and many maydes were brought together to the palace of Shushan, vnder the hand of Hege, Ester was brought also vnto the Kings house vnder the hande of Hege the keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the mayde pleased him, &amp; she founde fauour in his sight: therefore he caused her things for purification to be giuen her speedily, and her state, and seuen comely maides to be giuer her out of the Kings house, and he gaue change to her and to her maydes of the best in the house of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>But Ester shewed not her people and her kinred: for Mordecai had charged her, that shee should not tell it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked <note>For though she was taken away by a cruel law, yet he did not cease to have a fatherly care for her, and therefore often sought to hear of her.</note> every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>And when the course of euery mayd came, to go in to King Ahashuerosh, after that she had bene twelue moneths according to the maner of the women (for so were the dayes of their purifications accomplished, sixe moneths with oyle of myrrhe, and sixe moneths with sweete odours and in the purifying of the women:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was <note>Whatever apparel she asked for, the eunuch was bound to give to her.</note> given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the euening she went, &amp; on the morow she returned into the second house of the women vnder the hand of Shaashgaz the Kings eunuche, which kept the concubines: shee came in to the King no more, except shee pleased the King, and that she were called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, <note>In which her modesty appeared because she did not seek to dress to command her beauty but sought the eunuch's appointment.</note> appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which [is] the <note>Which contained part of December and part of January.</note> month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the King loued Ester aboue all the women, and shee founde grace and fauour in his sight more then all the virgins: so that he set the crowne of the kingdome vpon her head, &amp; made her Queene instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, [even] Esther's <note>That is, made for her sake.</note> feast; and he made a release <note>He released their tribute.</note> to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the <note>That is, great and magnificent.</note> state of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the <note>That is, at the marriage of Esther, which was the second marriage for the king.</note> second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Ester had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her: for Ester did after the worde of Mordecai, as when she was nourished with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay <note>Meaning, to kill him.</note> hand on the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing was knowen to Mordecai, and he tolde it vnto Queene Ester, and Ester certified the King thereof in Mordecais name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the <note>In the chronicles of the Medes and Persians, (Est_10:2).</note> chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things did King Ahashuerosh promote Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite, and exalted him, and set his seate aboue all the princes that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants, that [were] in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai <note>The Persians custom was to kneel down and reverence their kings, and such as he anointed in chief authority, which Mordecai would not do to this ambitious and proud man.</note> bowed not, nor did [him] reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the Kings seruants which were at the Kings gate, said vnto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the Kings commandement?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they <note>Thus we see that there is no one so wicked but they have their flatterers to accuse the godly.</note> told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman sawe that Mordecai bowed not the knee vnto him, nor did reuerence vnto him, then Haman was full of wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>Now he thought it too litle to lay hands onely on Mordecai: &amp; because they had shewed him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Iewes, that were throughout the whole kingdome of Ahashuerosh, euen the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, that [is], the month <note>Which contains part of March and part of April.</note> Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, <note>To know what month and day would be good to attempt this thing, that it might be successful: but God disappointed their lots and expectations.</note> before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], that [is], the month <note>Containing part of February and part of March.</note> Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keep they the <note>These are the two arguments which commonly the worldlings and the wicked use toward princes against the godly, that is, the contempt of their laws and diminishing of their profit without concern as to whether God is pleased or displeased.</note> king's laws: therefore it [is] not for the king's profit to suffer them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it please the King, let it be written that they may he destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of siluer by the handes of them that haue the charge of this businesse to bring it into the Kings treasurie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>Then the King tooke his ring from his hand &amp; gaue it vnto Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite the Iewes aduersarie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the King sayde vnto Haman, Let the siluer be thine, and the people to doe with them as it pleaseth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then were the Kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth, and there was written (according to all that Haman commaunded) vnto the Kings officers, and to the captaines that were ouer euery prouince, and to the rulers of euery people, and to euery prouince, according to the writing thereof, and to euery people according to their language: in the name of King Ahashuerosh was it written, and sealed with the Kings ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And the letters were sent by postes into all the Kings prouinces, to roote out, to kill and to destroy all the Iewes, both yong &amp; olde, children and women, in one day vpon the thirteenth day of the twelft moneth, (which is the moneth Adar) and to spoyle them as a pray. {\cf2 (13:1) The copie of the letters was this, The great King Artaxerxes writeth these thinges to the princes and gouernours that are vnder him from India vnto Ethiopia in an hundreth and seuen and twentie prouinces. (13:2) When I was made Lord ouer many people, and had subdued the whole earth vnto my dominion, I would not exalt my selfe by the reason of my power, but purposed with equitie alway and gentlenesse to gouerne my subiects, and wholy to set them in a peaceable life, and thereby to bring my kingdome vnto tranquilitie, that men might safely goe thorow on euery side, and to renewe peace againe, which all men desire. (13:3) Now when I asked my counsellers how these things might be brought to passe, one that was conuersant with vs, of excellent wisdome, and constant in good wil, and shewed him selfe to be of sure fidelitie, which had the second place in the kingdome, euen Aman, (13:4) Declared vnto vs, that in all nations there was scattered abroad a rebellious people, that had lawes contrary to all people, and haue alway despised the commandements of Kings, and so that this generall empire, that we haue begunne, cannot be gouerned without offence. (13:5) Seeing nowe wee perceiue, that this people alone are altogether contrary vnto euery man, vsing strange and other maner of lawes, and hauing an euill opinion of our doings, and goe about to stablish wicked matters, that our kingdome should not come to good estate, (13:6) Therefore haue we comaunded, that all they that are appointed in writing vnto you by Aman (which is ordeined ouer ye affaires, &amp; is as our second father) shall all with their wiues and children be destroyed &amp; rooted out with ye sword of their enemies without all mercy, and that none be spared the fourtenth day of the twelfth moneth Adar of this yeere, (13:7) That they which of olde, and nowe also haue euer bene rebellious, may in one day with violence be thrust downe into the hell, to the intent that after this time our affaires may bee without troubles, and well gouerned in all pointes.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>The contents of the writing was, that there shoulde be giuen a commandement in all prouinces, and published vnto all people, that they should be ready against the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the <note>That is, the Jews that were in Shushan.</note> city Shushan was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>Now when Mordecai perceiued all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackecloth and ashes, and went out into the middes of the citie, and cryed with a great crye, and a bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And came even before the king's <note>Because he would inform Esther of this cruel proclamation.</note> gate: for none [might] enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in euery prouince, and place, whither the Kings charge and his commission came, there was great sorowe among the Iewes, and fasting, and weeping and mourning, and many laye in sackecloth and in ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>Then Esters maydes and her eunuches came and tolde it her: therefore the Queene was very heauie, and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackecloth from him, but he receiued it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then called Ester Hatach one of the Kings eunuches, whom he had appointed to serue her, and gaue him a commandement vnto Mordecai, to knowe what it was, and why it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hatach went foorth to Mordecai vnto the streete of the citie, which was before the Kings gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai tolde him of all that which had come vnto him, and of the summe of the siluer that Haman had promised to pay vnto the Kings treasures, because of the Iewes, for to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gaue him the copy of the writing and commission that was giuen at Shushan, to destroy them, that he might shewe it vnto Ester and declare it vnto her, and to charge her that she should goe in to the King, and make petition and supplication before him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>So when Hatach came, he told Ester the wordes of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Then Ester sayde vnto Hatach, and commaunded him to say vnto Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the Kings seruants and the people of the Kings prouinces doe knowe, that whosoeuer, man or woman, that commeth to the King into the inner court, which is not called, there is a law of his, that he shall dye, except him to whom the King holdeth out the golden rodde, that he may liue.

(13:10) For thou hast made heauen and earth, and all the wonderous things vnder the heauen. (13:11) Thou art Lorde of all thinges, and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord. (13:12) Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither of malice, nor presumption, nor for any desire of glory, that I did this, and not bowe downe to proude Aman. (13:13) For I woulde haue bene content with good will for the saluation of Israel, to haue kist the sole of his feete. (13:14) But I did it, because I would not preferre the honour of a man aboue the glory of God, &amp; would not worship any but onely thee, my Lorde, and this haue I not done of pride. (13:15) And therefore, O Lord God and King, haue mercy vpon thy people: for they imagine how they may bring vs to naught, yea, they would destroy the inheritance, that hath bin thine from the beginning. (13:16) Despise not the portion, which thou hast deliuered out of Egypt for thine owne selfe. (13:17) Heare my prayer, and bee mercifull vnto thy portion: turne our sorow into ioy, that we may liue, O Lord, and praise thy Name: shut not the mouthes of them that praise thee. (13:18) All Israel in like maner cried most earnestly vnto the Lord, because that death was before their eyes. \par (14:1) Qveene Esther also, being in danger of death, resorted vnto the Lord, (14:2) And layd away her glorious apparell, and put on the garments of sighing, and mourning. In the stead of precious oyntment, she scattered ashes, and dongue vpon her head: and she humbled her body greatly with fasting, and all the places of her ioy filled she with the heare that she pluckt off. (14:3) And she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lorde, thou onely art our King: helpe me desolate woman, which haue no helper but thee. (14:4) For my danger is at hand. (14:5) From my youth vp I haue heard in the kinred of my father, that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from their predecessours for a perpetuall inheritance, and thou hast performed that which thou didest promise them. (14:6) Now Lord, we haue sinned before thee: therefore hast thou giuen vs into ye hands of our enemies. (14:7) Because we worshipped their gods, O Lorde, thou art righteous. (14:8) Neuerthelesse, it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captiuitie, but they haue stroken hands with their idoles, (14:9) That they wil abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordeined, &amp; destroy thine inheritace, to shut vp the mouth of them that praise thee, and to quench the glory of thy Temple, and of thine altar, (14:10) And to open the mouths of the heathen, that they may praise the power of the idoles, and to magnifie a fleshly King for euer. (14:11) O Lord, giue not thy scepter vnto them that be nothing, lest they laugh vs to scorne in our miserie: but turne their deuise vpon theselues, and make him an example, that hath begunne the same against vs. (14:12) Thinke vpon vs, O Lord, and shewe thy selfe vnto vs in the time of our distresse, and strengthen me, O King of gods, and Lord of all power. (14:13) Giue me an eloquent speach in my mouth before the Lion: turne his heart to hate our enemie, to destroy him, and all such as consent vnto him. (14:14) But deliuer vs with thine hand, and helpe me that am solitary, which haue no defence but onely thee. (14:15) Thou knowest all things, O Lord: thou knowest, that I hate the glory of the vnrighteous, and that I abhorre the bed of the vncircumcised, and of all the heathen. (14:16) Thou knowest my necessitie: for I hate this token of my preeminence, which I beare vpon mine head, what time as I must shewe my selfe, and that I abhorre it as a menstruous cloth, and that I weare it not when I am alone by my selfe, (14:17) And that I thine handmayde haue not eaten at Amans table, and that I haue had no pleasure in the Kings feast, nor drunke the wine of the drinke offerings, (14:18) And that I thine handmayde haue no ioye since the day that I was brought hither, vntill this day, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham.
