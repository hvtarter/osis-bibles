      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>
          <note>John goes before Christ as it was foretold by the prophets.</note>As it is written in the <note>This is the figure of speech called metonymy, by which is meant the books of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah.</note> prophets, Behold, <note>The prophet uses the present tense when he speaks of a thing to come, as he is as sure of it as if he had already seen it.</note> I send my messenger <note>A metaphor taken from the practice of kings, who used to have ushers go before them.</note> before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voyce of him that cryeth in the wildernesse is, Prepare the way of the Lord: make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>
          <note>The sum of John's doctrine, or rather Christ's, is remission of sins and amendment of life.</note>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the <note>The Jews used many kinds of washings: but here a peculiar kind of washing is spoken of, which contains within it true baptism, amendment of life, and forgiveness of sins.</note> baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And al ye countrey of Iudea, &amp; they of Hierusalem went out vnto him, and were all baptized of him in the riuer Iordan, confessing their sinnes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Nowe Iohn was clothed with camels heare, and with a girdle of a skinne about his loynes: and he did eate Locusts and wilde hony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>
          <note>John and all ministers cast their eyes upon Christ the Lord.</note>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to <note>The evangelist is expressing here the condition of the basest servant.</note> stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed have <note>He shows that all the power of baptism proceeds from Christ, who baptizes the inner man.</note> baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>
          <note>Christ consecrates our baptism in himself.</note>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>
          <note>The vocation of Christ from heaven, as head of the Church.</note>And straightway <note>John, who went down into the water with Christ.</note> coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am <note>{{See Mat_3:17}}</note> well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>
          <note>Christ being tempted overcomes.</note>And immediately the Spirit <note>«Driveth» here does not refer to something violent and forcible: but the divine power clothes Christ (who had lived until this time as a private man) with a new person, and prepares him for the battle that was at hand, and for his ministry.</note> driveth him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies, and was tempted of Satan: hee was also with the wilde beastes, and the Angels ministred vnto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>
          <note>After John is taken Christ shows himself more fully.</note>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent and beleeue the Gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>
          <note>The calling of Simon and Andrew.</note>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Then Iesus said vnto them, Folow me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And straightway they forsooke their nets, and folowed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>
          <note>The calling of James and John.</note>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And anon hee called them: and they left their father Zebedeus in the shippe with his hired seruants, and went their way after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into <note>From the city of Nazareth.</note> Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonied at his doctrine, for he taught them as one that had authoritie, and not as the Scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>
          <note>He preaches that doctrine by which alone Satan is driven out of the world, which he also confirms by a miracle.</note>And there was in their synagogue a man <note>Literally, «a man in an unclean spirit», that is to say, possessed with an evil spirit.</note> with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou <note>He was born in Bethlehem, but through the error of the people he was called a Nazarene, because he was brought up in Nazareth.</note> Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the <note>He alludes to the name that was written in the golden plate which the high Priest wore; (Exo_28:36)</note> Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And when the unclean spirit <note>See below, (Mar_9:20).</note> had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned <note>As men who were amazed.</note> among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority <note>By his own authority, or as a lord.</note> commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region <note>Not only into Galilee, but also into the countries bordering upon it.</note> round about Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>
          <note>By healing different diseases he shows that he has brought true life into the world.</note>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And Symons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer, and anon they told him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lifted her vp, and the feuer forsooke her by and by, and shee ministred vnto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And whe euen was come, at what time the sunne setteth, they brought to him all that were diseased, &amp; them that were possessed with deuils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole citie was gathered together at the doore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and <note>For it is not proper for the demons to preach the gospel; (Act_16:18)</note> suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning very early before day, Iesus arose &amp; went out into a solitarie place, and there praied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed carefully after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And when they had found him, they sayde vnto him, All men seeke for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said unto them, Let us go into the <note>Villages which were like cities.</note> next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And hee preached in their Synagogues, throughout all Galile, and cast the deuils out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>
          <note>By healing the leprous he shows that he came for this reason: to wipe out the sins of the world with his touch.</note>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Iesus had compassion, and put foorth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, I wil: be thou cleane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And assone as he had spoken, immediatly ye leprosie departed fro him, &amp; he was made cleane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And after he had giue him a streight commandement, he sent him away forthwith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>
          <note>He shows that he was not motivated by ambition, but only by the desire for his Father's glory, and by his love towards poor sinners.</note>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the <note>All the posterity of Aaron had the authority to judge a leper.</note> priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But when he was departed, hee began to tel many things, and to publish the matter: so that Iesus could no more openly enter into the citie, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from euery quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And <note>By healing this man who was sick from paralysis Christ shows that men recover all their lost strength in him through faith alone.</note> again he entered into Capernaum after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the <note>In the house where he used to remain: for he chose Capernaum to dwell in and left Nazareth.</note> house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as <note>Neither the house nor the entry was able to hold them.</note> about the door: and he preached the word unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And there came vnto him, that brought one sicke of the palsie, borne of foure men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they <note>They broke up the upper part of the house which was made simply, and let down the man that was sick from paralysis into the lower part where Christ preached, for they could not come before Christ in any other way.</note> let down the <note>The word signifies the poorest kind of bed, upon which men used to lay down at noon, and at such other times to refresh themselves; we call it a couch.</note> bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Nowe when Iesus sawe their faith, he saide to the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and <note>In their minds disputing upon the matter, arguing both sides.</note> reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why doeth this man speake such blasphemies? who can forgiue sinnes, but God onely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediatly when Iesus perceiued in his spirite, that thus they reasoned with themselues, he sayde vnto them, Why reason yee these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie, Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee? or to say, Arise, and take vp thy bed, and walke?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that ye may knowe, that the Sonne of man hath authoritie in earth to forgiue sinnes, (he sayde vnto the sicke of the palsie.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say vnto thee, Arise and take vp thy bed, and get thee hence into thine owne house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all <note>Literally, «past themselves», or «out of their wit».</note> amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>
          <note>The gospel offends the proud and saves the humble.</note>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by, he saw <note>Matthew's other name.</note> Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to passe, as Iesus sate at table in his house, many Publicanes &amp; sinners sate at table also with Iesus, and his disciples: for there were many that followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with the Publicanes and sinners, they sayd vnto his disciples, Howe is it, that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Now when Iesus heard it, hee sayde vnto them, The whole haue no neede of the Physicion, but the sicke. I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>
          <note>The superstitious and hypocrites rashly put the sum of godliness in matters which do no matter, and are reprehended for three reasons. First, by not considering what every man's strength is able to bear, they rashly make all sorts of laws concerning such things, without any discretion.</note>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Iesus saide vnto them, Can the children of the marriage chamber fast, whiles the bridegrome is with them? as long as they haue the bridegrome with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the daies will come, when the bridegrome shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in those daies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>Also no man soweth a piece of newe cloth in an olde garment: for els the newe piece that filled it vp, taketh away somewhat from the olde, and the breach is worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>Likewise, no man putteth newe wine into old vessels: for els the new wine breaketh the vessels, and the wine runneth out, and the vessels are lost: but newe wine must be put into new vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>
          <note>Secondly, because they do not distinguish between the laws which God made concerning things, and the laws that they made concerning the same things, which are not at all based on the law.</note>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the <note>Literally, «on the Sabbaths», that is, on the holy days.</note> sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharises saide vnto him, Beholde, why doe they on the Sabbath day, that which is not lawfull?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he saide to them, Haue yee neuer read what Dauid did when he had neede, and was an hungred, both he, and they that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God in the days of <note>In (1Sa_21:1) he is called Ahimelech and his son is called Abiathar, but by conferring other places it is plain that both of them had two names; see (1Ch_24:6; 2Sa_8:17; 2Sa_15:29; 1Ki_2:26; 2Ki_25:18).</note> Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And hee sayde to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <note>Has the sabbath day in his power, and may rule it as he desires.</note> sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And <note>Thirdly, because they preferred the ceremonial law (which was but an addition to the moral law) before the moral law, whereas in reality they should have learned from this the true use of the ceremonial law.</note> he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a <note>That is, unprofitable and dead.</note> withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, whether he would heale him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>Then he saide vnto the man which had the withered hand, Arise: stand forth in the middes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save <note>He uses here the figure of speech called synecdoche, for this type of saying, «to save the life», is the same as saying «to save the man».</note> life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And when he had looked round about on them <note>Men are angry when they have wrong done to them, but not without sin: but Christ is angry without sin, and he is not sorry for the injury that is done to him as much as he is for their wickedness; and therefore he had pity upon them, and because of that he is said to have been grieved.</note> with anger, being grieved for the <note>As though their heart had been closed up and had grown together, so that wholesome doctrine had no effect upon them.</note> hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>
          <note>The more the truth is suppressed, the more it comes out.</note>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the <note>See (Mat_22:16).</note> Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Iesus auoided with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude followed him from Galile, and from Iudea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] <note>Which Josephus called stony or rocky.</note> beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should <note>Should always be ready for him.</note> wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had <note>Diseases with which God scourges men as it were with whips.</note> plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And <note>In those whom they had entered into: or by the figure of speech called metonymy, it refers to those who were vexed with the unclean spirits.</note> unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he sharply rebuked them, to the ende they should not vtter him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then hee went vp into a mountaine, and called vnto him whome he woulde, and they came vnto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>
          <note>The twelve apostles are set apart to be trained for the office of the apostleship.</note>And he <note>Chose and appointed twelve to be familiar and well acquainted with him.</note> ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>And that they might haue power to heale sicknesses, and to cast out deuils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And the first was Simon, and hee named Simon, Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>Then Iames the sonne of Zebedeus, &amp; Iohn Iames brother (and surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sonnes of thunder,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and <note>Whom Luke also calls Judas: and to make a distinction the other Judas is called Iscariot.</note> Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an <note>The disciples whom Christ had taken as part of his company and to live with him come home to his house, to be with him from this point on.</note> house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And the multitude assembled againe, so that they could not so much as eate bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>
