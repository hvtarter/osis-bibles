      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the <note>First of all, and before any creature was, God made heaven and earth out of nothing.</note> beginning God created the heaven and the earth. <note>The Argument - Moses in effect declares three things, which are in this book chiefly to be considered: First, that the world and all things in it were created by God, and to praise his Name for the infinite graces, with which he had endued him, fell willingly from God through disobedience, who yet for his own mercies sake restored him to life, and confirmed him in the same by his promise of Christ to come, by whom he should overcome Satan, death and hell. Secondly, that the wicked, unmindful of God's most excellent benefits, remained still in their wickedness, and so falling most horribly from sin to sin, provoked God (who by his preachers called them continually to repentance) at length to destroy the whole world. Thirdly, he assures us by the examples of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the rest of the patriarchs, that his mercies never fail those whom he chooses to be his Church, and to profess his Name in earth, but in all their afflictions and persecutions he assists them, sends comfort, and delivers them, so that the beginning, increase, preservation and success of it might be attributed to God only. Moses shows by the examples of Cain, Ishmael, Esau and others, who were noble in man's judgment, that this Church depends not on the estimation and nobility of the world: and also by the fewness of those, who have at all times worshipped him purely according to his word that it stands not in the multitude, but in the poor and despised, in the small flock and little number, that man in his wisdom might be confounded, and the name of God praised forever.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was <note>As an unformed lump and without any creature in it: for the waters covered everything.</note> without form, and void; and <note>Darkness covered the deep waters, for the waters covered everything.</note> darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God <note>He maintained this disordered mass by his secret power.</note> moved upon the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light: and there was <note>The light was made before either Sun or Moon was created: therefore we must not attribute that to the creatures that are God's instruments, which only belong to God.</note> light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God sawe the light that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light, Day, and the darkenes, he called Night. So the euening and the morning were the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>Againe God saide, Let there be a firmament in the middes of the waters: and let it separate the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] <note>As the sea and rivers, from those waters that are in the clouds, which are upheld by God's power, least they should overwhelm the world.</note> under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament <note>That is, the region of the air, and all that is above us.</note> Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>God saide againe, Let the waters vnder the heauen be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appeare; it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God sawe that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, <note>So that we see it is the only the power of God's word that makes the earth fruitful, which naturally is barren.</note> Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God <note>This sentence is often repeated, to signify that God made all his creatures to serve for his glory and for the profit of man: but because of sin they were cursed, yet the elect, by Christ are restored, and serve to their wealth.</note> saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>So the euening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be <note>By the lights be means the sun, the moon, and the stars.</note> lights in the firmament of the heaven to <note>Which is the artificial day, from the sun rising, to the going down.</note> divide the day from the night; and let them be for <note>Of things belonging to natural and political orders and seasons.</note> signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And let them be for lightes in the firmament of the heauen to giue light vpon the earth; it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made two great <note>That is, the sun and the moon, and here he speaks as man judges by his eye: for else the moon is less than the planet Saturn.</note> lights; the greater light to <note>To give it sufficient light, as instruments appointed for the same, to serve man's purposes.</note> rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of the heauen, to shine vpon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkenes: and God sawe that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>So the euening and the morning were the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the <note>As fish and worms which slide, swim or creep.</note> moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the <note>The fish and fowls had both one beginning, in which we see that nature gives place to God's will, in that the one sort is made to fly about in the air, and the other to swim beneath in the water.</note> waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God <note>That is, by the virtue of his word he gave power to his creatures to reproduce.</note> blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>So the euening and the morning were the fift day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>Moreouer God said, Let the earth bring foorth the liuing thing according to his kinde, cattell, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth, according to his kinde; it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beast of the earth according to his kinde, and the cattell according to his kinde, &amp; euery creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: &amp; God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, <note>God commanded the water and the earth to bring forth other creatures: but of man he says, «Let us make...» signifying that God takes counsel with his wisdom and virtue purposing to make an excellent work above all the rest of his creation.</note> Let us make man in our <note>This image and likeness of God in man is expounded in (Eph_4:24) where it is written that man was created after God in righteousness and true holiness meaning by these two words, all perfection, as wisdom, truth, innocency, power, etc.</note> image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God <note>The propagation.</note> blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you <note>God's great.</note> every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>Likewise to euery beast of the earth, and to euery foule of the heauen, and to euery thing that moueth vpon the earth, which hath life in it selfe, euery greene herbe shall be for meate; it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God sawe all that he had made, and loe, it was very good. So the euening and the morning were the sixt day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the <note>That is, the innumerable abundance of creatures in heaven and earth.</note> host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he <note>For he had now finished his creation, but his providence still watches over his creatures and governs them.</note> rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and <note>Appointed it to be kept holy, that man might in it consider the excellency of his works and God's goodness toward him.</note> sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heauens and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lorde God made the earth and the heauens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to <note>God only opens the heavens and shuts them, he sends drought and rain according to his good pleasure.</note> rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>But a myst went vp from the earth, and watered all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And the LORD God formed man <note>He shows what man's body was created from, to the intent that man should not glory in the excellency of his own nature.</note> [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in <note>This was the name of a place, as some think in Mesopotamia, most pleasant and abundant in all things.</note> Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the <note>Who was a sign of the life received from God.</note> tree of life also in the midst of the garden, <note>That is, of miserable experience, which came by disobeying God.</note> and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And out of Eden went a riuer to water the garden, and from thence it was deuided, and became into foure heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land <note>Havilah is a country adjoining Persia to the east, and inclining towards the west.</note> of Havilah, where [there is] gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the golde of that land is good: there is Bdelium, and the Onix stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the seconde riuer is Gihon: the same compasseth the whole lande of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>The name also of the third riuer is Hiddekel: this goeth toward the Eastside of Asshur: and the fourth riuer is Perath)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to <note>God would not have man idle, though as yet there was no need to labour.</note> dress it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And the LORD God <note>So that man might know there was a sovereign Lord, to whom he owed obedience.</note> commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely <note>By death he means the separation of man from God, who is our life and chief happiness: and also that our disobedience is the cause of it.</note> die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>Also the Lorde God saide, It is not good that the man should be himself alone: I wil make him an helpe meete for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto <note>By moving them to come and submit themselves to Adam.</note> Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>The man therefore gaue names vnto all cattell, and to the foule of the heauen, and to euery beast of the fielde: but for Adam founde he not an helpe meete for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>Therefore the Lord God caused an heauie sleepe to fall vpon the man, and he slept: and he tooke one of his ribbes, &amp; closed vp the flesh in steade thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a <note>Signifying that mankind was perfect, when the woman was created, who before was like an imperfect building.</note> woman, and brought her unto the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>Then the man said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called woman, because she was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore shall a man leave <note>So marriage requires a greater duty of us toward our wives, than otherwise we are bound to show to our parents.</note> his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not <note>For before sin entered, all things were honest and comely.</note> ashamed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more <note>As Satan can change himself into an angel of light, so did he abuse the wisdom of the serpent to deceive man.</note> subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he <note>God allowed Satan to make the serpent his instrument and to speak through him.</note> said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said vnto the serpent, We eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, <note>In doubting God's warnings she yielded to Satan.</note> lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely <note>This is Satan's chiefest subtilty, to cause us not to fear God's warnings.</note> die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, <note>As though he said, God forbids you to eat of the fruit, only because he knows that if you eat of it, you will be like him.</note> knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he <note>Not so much to please his wife, as moved by ambition at her persuasion.</note> did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they <note>They began to feel their misery, but they did not seek God for a remedy.</note> knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife <note>The sinful conscience flees God's presence.</note> hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>But the Lord God called to the man, and said vnto him, Where art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] <note>His hypocrisy appears in that he hid the cause of his nakedness, which was the transgression of God's commandment.</note> naked; and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he saide, Who tolde thee, that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, <note>Instead of confessing her sin, she increases it by accusing the serpent.</note> The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, <note>He asked the reason from Adam and his wife, because he would bring them to repentance, but he does not ask the serpent, because he would show him no mercy.</note> Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and <note>As a vile and contemptible beast, (Isa_65:25).</note> dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.9.6'>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, <note>Not only by the magistrate, but often God raises up one murderer to kill another.</note> by man shall his blood be shed: for in the <note>Therefore to kill man is to deface God's image, and so injury is not only done to man, but also to God.</note> image of God made he man.</verse>
