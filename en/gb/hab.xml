      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw. <note>The Argument - The Prophet complains to God, considering the great felicity of the wicked, and the miserable oppression of the godly, who endure all types of affliction and cruelty, and yet can see no end. Therefore he had this revelation shown to him by God, that the Chaldeans would come and take them away as captives, so that they could look for no end of their troubles as yet, because of their stubbornness and rebellion against the Lord. And lest the godly should despair, seeing this horrible confusion, he comforts them by this, that God will punish the Chaldeans their enemies, when their pride and cruelty will be at height. And for this reason he exhorts the faithful to patience by his own example, and shows them a form of prayer, with which they should comfort themselves.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! [even] cry out to thee <note>The Prophet complains to God, and bewails that among the Jews is left no fairness and brotherly love: but instead of these reigns cruelty, theft, contention, and strife.</note> [of] violence, and thou wilt not save!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'>Why doest thou shewe mee iniquitie, and cause me to beholde sorowe? for spoyling, and violence are before me: and there are that rayse vp strife and contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'>Therefore the law is feeble, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth <note>To suppress him, if any should show himself zealous of God's cause.</note> surround the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth <note>Because the judges who should remedy this excess, are as evil as the rest.</note> perverted</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'>Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for [I] will work a work in your days, [which] <note>As in times past you would not believe God's word, so you will not now believe the strange plagues which are at hand.</note> ye will not believe, though it be told [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'>For lo, I raise vp the Caldeans, that bitter &amp; furious nation, which shall goe vpon the breadth of the lande to possesse the dwelling places, that are not theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'>They [are] terrible and dreadful: <note>They themselves will be your judges in this cause, and none will have authority over them to control them.</note> their judgment and their dignity shall proceed from themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'>Their horses also are swifter then the leopards, and are more fierce then the wolues in the euening: and their horsemen are many: &amp; their horsemen shall come from farre: they shall flie as the eagle hasting to meate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up [as] the <note>For the Jews most feared this wind, because it destroyed their fruits.</note> east wind, and they shall gather the captives <note>They will be so many in number.</note> as the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap <note>They will cast up mounds against it.</note> dust, and take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'>Then shall [his] mind change, and he shall <note>The Prophet comforts the faithful that God will also destroy the Babylonians, because they will abuse this victory, and become proud and insolent, attributing the praise of this to their idols.</note> pass over, and offend, [imputing] this his power to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>[Art] thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not <note>He assures the godly of God's protection, showing that the enemy can do no more than God has appointed, and also that their sins require such a sharp rod.</note> die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>Thou art of pure eyes, and canst not see euill: thou canst not behold wickednesse: wherefore doest thou looke vpon the transgressors, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked deuoureth the man, that is more righteous then he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'>And makest men as the <note>So that the great devours the small, and the Chaldeans destroy all the world.</note> fishes of the sea, as the creeping animals, [that have] no ruler over them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'>They take vp all with the angle: they catch it in their net, and gather it in their yarne, whereof they reioyce and are glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'>Therefore they sacrifice to their <note>Meaning that the enemies flatter themselves, and glory in their own strength, power, and intellect.</note> net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion [is] fat, and their food plenteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay <note>Meaning, that they would not.</note> the nations?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'>I will stand upon my <note>I will renounce my own judgment, and only depend on God to be instructed what I will answer those that abuse my preaching, and to be armed against all temptations.</note> watch, and seat myself upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tablets, that he may run <note>Write it in great letters, that he that runneth may read it.</note> that readeth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'>For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the <note>Which contained the destruction of the enemy, and the comfort of the Church. And even though God does not execute this according to man's hasty affections, yet the issue of both is certain at his appointed time.</note> end it shall speak, and not lie: though it may tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'>Behold, <note>To trust in himself, or in any worldly thing, is never to be at peace: for the only rest is to trust in God by faith; (Rom_1:17; Gal_3:11; Heb_10:38).</note> his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'>Yea also, because <note>He compares the proud and covetous man to a drunkard that is without reason and sense, whom God will punish and make a laughing stock to all the world: and this he speaks for the comfort of the godly, and against the Chaldeans.</note> he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth to him all nations, and heapeth to him all people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! <note>Signifying that all the world will wish the destruction of tyrants, and that by their oppression and covetousness, they heap but upon themselves more heavy burdens: for the more they get, the more are they troubled.</note> how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'>Shall <note>That is, the Medes and persians, that would destroy the Babylonians?</note> they not rise suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall oppress thee, and thou shalt be for booty to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'>Because thou hast spoyled many nations, all the remnant of the people shal spoyle thee, because of mens blood, and for the wrong done in the land, in the citie, and vnto all that dwell therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'>Ho, he that coueteth an euil couetousnesse to his house, that he may set his nest on hie, to escape from the power of euil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'>Thou <note>Signifying that the covetous man is the ruin of his own house, when he thinks to enrich it be cruelty and oppression.</note> gavest shameful counsel to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned [against] thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'>For the <note>The stones of the house will cry, and say that they are built from blood, and the wood will answer and say the same of itself.</note> stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'>Wo vnto him that buildeth a towne with blood, and erecteth a citie by iniquitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'>Behold, [is it] not from the <note>Meaning, that God will not defer his vengeance long, but will come and destroy all their labours, as though they were consumed with fire.</note> LORD of hosts that the people shall labour [only] for fire, and the nations shall weary themselves for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'>For the earth shall <note>In the destruction of the Babylonians his glory will appear through all the world.</note> be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'>Woe to him that giveth his neighbour <note>He reproaches by this the king of Babylon, who as he was drunken with covetousness and cruelty, so he provoked others to the same, and inflamed them by his madness, and so in the end brought them to shame.</note> drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunk also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'>Thou art filled with shame <note>Whereas you thought to have the glory of these your doings, they will turn to your shame: for you will drink of the same cup with others in your turn.</note> for glory: drink thou also, and let thy shame come upon thee: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned to thee, and utter shame [shall be] on thy glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'>For the <note>Because the Babylonians were cruel not only against other nations, but also against the people of God, which is meant by Lebanon and the beast in it, he shows that the same cruelly will be executed against them.</note> violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'>What profiteth the graven <note>He shows that the Babylonian gods could not help them at all, for they were but blocks or stones. {{See Jer_10:8}}</note> image that its maker hath engraved it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth in it, to make dumb idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'>Woe to him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! <note>If you will consider what it is, and how it has neither breath nor life, but is a dead thing.</note> Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all within it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'>But the Lord is in his holy Temple: let all the earth keepe silence before him.</verse>
