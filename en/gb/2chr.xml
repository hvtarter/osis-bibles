      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God [was] with him, and magnified him exceedingly. <note>The Argument - This second book contains in brief the contents of the two books of the kings: that is, from the reign of Solomon to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian captivity. In this story some things are told in more detail than in the books of the kings and therefore help greatly in the understanding of the prophets. Three things are chiefly to be considered here: First, that when the godly kings saw the plagues of God prepared against their country for sin, they turned to the Lord and by earnest prayer were heard, and the plagues removed. Secondly, while the good rulers always loved the prophets of God and were zealous to set forth his religion throughout their dominions, it offended God greatly that the wicked hated his ministers, deposed them and set up idolatry and attempted served God according to the fantasy of men. Thus we have the chief acts from the beginning of the world to the rebuilding of Jerusalem in the 32nd year of Darius, in total 3568 years and six months.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Then Solomon <note>That is, he proclaimed a solemn sacrifice and commanded that all should attend.</note> spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that [was] at <note>Read (1Ki_3:4).</note> Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle <note>So called, because by it God showed signs of his presence to the congregation.</note> of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>But the Arke of God had Dauid brought vp from Kiriath-iearim, when Dauid had made preparation for it: for he had pitched a tent for it in Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover the <note>Which was for the burnt offerings, (Exo_27:1).</note> brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Salomon offred there before the Lord vpon the brasen altar that was in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: euen a thousand burnt offrings offred he vpon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>The same night did God appeare vnto Salomon, and sayde vnto him, Aske what I shall giue thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Salomon sayde vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father and hast made me to reigne in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be <note>Perform your promise made to my father concerning me.</note> established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may <note>That I may govern this people, (1Ch_27:1; 1Ki_3:7).</note> go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, [that is so] great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the <note>That is, to be avenged on your enemies.</note> life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>Wisdome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, and I will giue thee riches and treasures and honour, so that there hath not bene the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shal there be the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>Then Salomon came from the hie place, that was at Gibeon, to Ierusalem from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and reigned ouer Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the <note>Which were cities appointed to keep and maintain the chariots.</note> chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem [as plenteous] as <note>He caused so great plenty that it was valued no more than stones.</note> stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that [are] in the vale for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: <note>Read (1Ki_20:28).</note> the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>They came vp also and brought out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer, that is an horse for an hundreth and fiftie: and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites, and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>Then Salomon determined to builde an house for the Name of the Lord, and an house for his kingdome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and <note>Which is to be understood of all sorts of officers and overseers: for else the chief officers were but 3300 as in (1Ki_5:16).</note> six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Salomon sent to Huram the king of Tyrus, saying, As thou hast done to Dauid my father, and didst sende him cedar trees to buylde him an house to dwell in, so do to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I buylde an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God, to sanctifie it vnto him, and to burne sweete incense before him, and for the continuall shewbread, and for the burnt offrings of the morning and euening, on the Sabbath dayes, and in the new moneths, &amp; in the solemne feastes of the Lorde our God: this is a perpetuall thing for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And the house which I buylde, is great: for great is our God aboue all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who [am] I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn <note>That is, to do the service which he has commanded, signifying that no one is able to honour and serve God in the perfection his majesty deserves.</note> sacrifice before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Sende me nowe therefore a cunning man that can worke in golde, in siluer, &amp; in brasse, and in yron, &amp; in purple, and crimosin &amp; blue silke, &amp; that can graue in grauen worke with the cunning men that are with me in Iudah &amp; in Ierusalem, whom Dauid my father hath prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and <note>Some take it for Brazil, or the wood called Ebenum, others for coral.</note> algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants [shall be] with thy servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>That they may prepare me timber in abudance: for the house which I doe buylde, is great and wonderfull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty <note>Of «bath» read (1Ki_7:26). It is also called ephah, but an ephah measures dry things as a bath is a measure for liquids.</note> thousand baths of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Huram King of Tyrus answered in writing which he sent to Salomon, Because the Lorde hath loued his people, he hath made thee King ouer them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram said moreover, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a <note>The very heavens confessed that it was a singular gift of God when he gave to any nation a king that was wise and of understanding, though it appears that this Hiram had the true knowledge of God.</note> wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>Now therefore I haue sent a wise man, and of vnderstanding of my father Hurams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>The son of a woman of the <note>It is also written that she was of the tribe of Naphtali, (1Ki_7:14) which may be understood that by reason of the confusion of tribes which then began to be, they married in various tribes so that by her father she might be of Dan and by her mother of Naphtali.</note> daughters of Dan, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore the wheate and the barley, the oyle and the wine, which my lorde hath spoken of, let him send vnto his seruants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And we wil cut wood in Lebanon as much as thou shalt neede, and will bring it to thee in raftes by the sea to Iapho, so thou mayest cary them to Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And Salomon nombred al the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the nombring that his father Dauid had nombred them: &amp; they were found an hundreth and three &amp; fiftie thousand, and sixe hundreth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he set seuentie thousande of them to the burden, and fourescore thousande to hewe stones in the mountaine, and three thousande and sixe hundreth ouerseers to cause the people to worke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount <note>Which is the mountain where Abraham was thought to have sacrificed his son, (Gen_22:2).</note> Moriah, where [the LORD] appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he beganne to buylde in the seconde moneth and the second day, in the fourth yeere of his reigne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first <note>According to the whole length of the temple,</note> measure [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house], the length [of it was] according to the <note>It contained as much as the breadth of the temple did, (1Ki_6:3).</note> breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height [was] an <note>From the foundation to the top: for in the book of the kings mention is made from the foundation to the first stage.</note> hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And the greater house he sieled with firre tree which he ouerlayd with good golde, &amp; graued thereon palme trees and chaines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold [was] gold of <note>Some think it is Peru.</note> Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>The house, I say, the beames, postes, and walles thereof &amp; the doores thereof ouerlayde he with gold, &amp; graued Cherubims vpon the walles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>He made also the house of the most holy place: the length thereof was in the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, &amp; the breadth thereof twentie cubites: and he ouerlayde it with the best golde, of sixe hundreth talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the weight of the nayles was fiftie shekels of golde, and hee ouerlayde the chambers with golde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And in the house of the most holy place he made two Cherubims wrought like children, and ouerlayd them with golde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the winges of the Cherubims were twentie cubites long: the one wing was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing fiue cubites, reaching to the wing of the other Cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>Likewise the wing of ye other Cherub was fiue cubites, reaching to the wall of the house, &amp; the other wing fiue cubites ioyning to the wing of the other Cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these Cherubims were spread abroade twentie cubites: they stoode on their feete, and their faces were toward the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the <note>Which separated the temple from the most holy place.</note> vail [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>Also he made before the house two pillars of <note>Every one was eighteen cubits long, but the half cubit could not be seen, for it was hid in the roundness of the chapiter, and therefore he gives to every one only 17 and a half.</note> thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars; and made an <note>For every pillar a hundred, read (1Ki_7:20).</note> hundred pomegranates, and put [them] on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he set vp the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hande and the other on the left, and called that on the right hand Iachin, &amp; that on the left hand Boaz.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>Then Asa brought out siluer and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lorde, and of the Kings house, and sent to Benhadad King of Aram that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>[There is] a league between me and thee, as [there was] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, <note>He thought to repulse his adversary by an unlawful means, that is, by seeking help from infidels, as they who seek the help of Turks, thinking by it to make themselves stronger.</note> break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>And Benhadad hearkened vnto King Asa, and sent the captaines of the armies which hee had, against the cities of Israel; they smote Iion, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.6'>Then Asa the King tooke all Iudah, and caryed away the stones of Ramah and the tymber thereof, wherewith Baasha did builde, and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.7'>And at that same time Hanani the Seer came to Asa King of Iudah, and saide vnto him, Because thou hast rested vpon the king of Aram, and not rested in the Lorde thy God, therefore is the hoste of the King of Aram escaped out of thine hande.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.10'>Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for [he was] <note>Thus instead of turning to God in repentance, he disdained the admonition of the prophet, and punished him, as the wicked do when they are told of their faults.</note> in a rage with him because of this [thing]. And Asa oppressed [some] of the people the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.11'>And behold, the actes of Asa first and last, loe, they are written in the booke of the Kings of Iudah and Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.13'>So Asa slept with his fathers, and dyed in the one and fourtieth yeere of his reigne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.14'>And they buryed him in one of his sepulchres, which he had made for him selfe in the citie of Dauid, and layed him in the bed, which they had filled with sweete odours and diuers kindes of spices made by the arte of the apoticarie: and they burnt odours for him with an exceeding great fire.</verse>
