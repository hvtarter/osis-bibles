  <div type='book' osisID='2Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, <note>Sent of God to preach that life which he promised in Christ Jesus.</note> according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>To Timotheus my beloued sonne: Grace, mercie and peace from God the Father, and from Iesus Christ our Lorde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>
          <note>The purpose that he aims at in this epistle is to confirm Timothy to continue constantly and bravely even to the end. And he sets first before him the great good will he has for him, and then reckons up the excellent gifts which God would as it were have to be in Timothy by inheritance, and his ancestors, which might so much the more make him bound to God.</note>I thank God, whom I serve from [my] <note>From Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for he speaks not of Pharisaism, but of Christianity.</note> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>Desiring to see thee, mindefull of thy teares, that I may be filled with ioy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>When I call to remembrance the vnfained faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and am assured that it dwelleth in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>
          <note>He urges us to set the invincible power of the Spirit which God has given us, against those storms which may, and do come upon us.</note>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou <note>The gift of God is as it were a certain living flame kindled in our hearts, which the flesh and the devil go about to put out: and therefore we as their opponents must labour as much as we can to foster and keep it burning.</note> stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God hath not given us the spirit of <note>To pierce us through, and terrify us, as men whom the Lord will destroy.</note> fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>
          <note>He proves that the ignominy or shame of the cross is not to be ashamed of, and also that it is glorious and most honourable: first, because the Gospel for which the godly are afflicted is the testimony of Christ: and secondly because at length the great virtue and power of God appears in them.</note>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me <note>For his sake.</note> his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the <note>This Gospel is said to be in a way afflicted in those that preach it.</note> gospel according to the <note>Through the power of God.</note> power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>
          <note>He shows with how great benefits God has bound us to maintain boldly and constantly his glory which is joined with our salvation, and reckons up the causes of our salvation, that is, that free and eternal purpose of God, to save us in Christ who was to come. And by this it would come to pass, that we would at length be freely called by God through the preaching of the Gospel, to Christ the destroyer of death and author of immortality.</note>Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was <note>He says that that grace was given to us from everlasting, to which we were predestinated from everlasting. So that the doctrine of foreseen faith and foreseen works is completely contrary to the doctrine which preaches and teaches the grace of God.</note> given us in Christ Jesus <note>Before the beginning of years, which has run on ever since the beginning of the world.</note> before the world began,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to <note>Has caused life and immortality to appear.</note> light through the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>
          <note>That is, the Gospel which the apostle preached.</note>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>
          <note>He confirms his apostleship by a strange argument, that is, because the world could not abide it, and therefore it persecuted him that preached it.</note>For the which cause I also suffer these things: <note>By setting his own example before us, he shows us how it may be, that we will not be ashamed of the cross of Christ, that is, if we are sure that God both can and will keep the salvation which he has as it were laid up in store by himself for us against that day.</note> nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>
          <note>He shows in what he ought to be most constant, that is, both in the doctrine itself, the essential parts of which are faith and charity, and next in the manner of teaching it, a living pattern and shape of which Timothy knew in the apostle.</note>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>
          <note>An amplification, taken from the dignity of so great a benefit committed to the ministers.</note>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep <note>The taking away of an objection. It is a hard thing to do it, but the Spirit of God is mighty, who has inwardly endued us with his power.</note> by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>
          <note>He prevents an offence which arose by the means of certain ones that fell from God and the faith, and utters also their names that they might be known by all men. But he sets against them the singular faith of one man, that one good example alone might counterbalance and weigh down all evil examples.</note>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord giue mercie vnto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chaine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord graunt vnto him, that he may finde mercie with the Lorde at that day, and in howe many things he hath ministred vnto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou <note>The conclusion of the former exhortation which has also a declaration added to it: how those who do not keep that worthy thing that is committed to them, who keep it to themselves, but rather those who do most freely communicate it with others, to the end that many may be partakers of it, without any man's loss or hindrance.</note> therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things that thou hast heard of me among <note>When many were there, who can bear witness of these things.</note> many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>
          <note>Another admonition: that the ministry of the word is a spiritual warfare, which no man can so travail in that he pleases his captain, unless he abstains from and parts with all hindrances which might draw him away from it.</note>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <note>With affairs of household, or other things that belong to other ordinary businesses.</note> [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>
          <note>The third admonition: the ministry is similar to a game in which men strive for the victory, and no man is crowned, unless he strive according to the laws which are prescribed, be they ever so hard and painful.</note>And if a man also strive for masteries, [yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>
          <note>Another similarity with respect to the same matter: no man may look for the harvest, unless he first take pains to plow and sow his ground.</note>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>
          <note>All these things cannot be understood, and much less practised, unless we ask of God and he gives us understanding.</note>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>
          <note>He confirms plainly two principles of our faith, which are alway assaulted by heretics, the one of which (that is, that Christ is the true Messiah, made man of the seed of David) is the ground of our salvation: and the other is the highest part of it, that is, that he is risen again from the dead.</note>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>
          <note>The taking away of an objection: it is true that he is kept in prison as an evildoer, yet there is no reason why some should therefore go about to take away credit from his Gospel. And this is because God has blessed his ministry; indeed, the example of this his captivity and patience, did rather in different ways strengthen and encourage his Church in the hope of a better life.</note>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I suffer all things, for the elects sake, that they might also obtaine the saluation which is in Christ Iesus, with eternall glorie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>
          <note>The fourth admonition: we ought not to contend upon words and questions, which are not only unprofitable, but also for the most part hurtful: but rather upon this, how we may compose ourselves to every manner of patience, and to die also with Christ (that is to say, for Christ's name) because that is the plain way to the most glorious life. And contrary to this, the falling away of men can diminish no part of the truth of God, even though by such means they procure most certain destruction to themselves.</note>[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be <note>If we are afflicted with Christ, and for Christ's sake.</note> dead with [him], we shall also live with [him]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we suffer, we shall also reigne together with him: if we denie him, he also will denie vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we beleeue not, yet abideth he faithfull: he cannot denie himselfe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Of these things put [them] in remembrance, <note>Call God to witness, or as a Judge: as Moses, Joshua, Samuel, and Paul himself did, in Acts 13.</note> charging [them] before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>
          <note>The fifth admonition: a minister must not be an idle disputer, but a faithful steward in correctly dividing the word of truth, in so much that he must stop the mouths of other vain babblers.</note>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, <note>By adding nothing to it, neither deleting anything, neither mangling it, nor rending it apart, nor distorting it: but marking diligently what his hearers are able to bear, and what is fit to edifying.</note> rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>
          <note>Mark and watch, and see that they do not creep on further.</note>But shun profane [and] vain babblings: <note>He reveals the subtilty of Satan, who beginning with these principles, draws us by little and little to ungodliness through the means of that wicked and profane babbling, which gradually increases. And this he proves by the horrible example of those that taught that the resurrection was already past.</note> for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And their worde shall fret as a canker: of which sort is Hymeneus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>Which as concerning ye trueth haue erred from the marke, saying that the resurrection is past alreadie, and do destroy the faith of certaine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>
          <note>A digression, in which he heals the offence that rose by their falling away. Firstly, he shows that the elect are out of all danger of any such falling away. Secondly, that they are known to God, and not to us: and therefore it is no marvel if we often mistake hypocrites for true brethren. But we must take heed that we are not like them, but rather that we are indeed such as we are said to be.</note>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that <note>That serves and worships him, and as it were named of him, a faithful man or Christian.</note> nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>
          <note>The taking away of an objection: it is not dishonour to the good man of the house, that he has not in a great house all vessels of one sort and for one service, but we must look to this, that we are found vessels prepared to honour.</note>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man therefore <note>By these words is meant the execution of the matter, and not the cause: for in that we purge ourselves, it is not to be attributed to any free will that is in us, but to God, who freely and wholly works in us, a good and an effectual will.</note> purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, [and] prepared unto every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>
          <note>Returning to the matter from where he digressed in (2Ti_2:16), he warns him to exercise himself in serious matters, and such as pertain to godliness.</note>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, <note>The sixth admonition: we must above all things avoid all bitterness of mind, both in teaching all men, and also in calling those back who have gone out of the way.</note> peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>And put away foolish and vnlearned questions, knowing that they ingender strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all [men], apt to teach, <note>To win them through our patient bearing with them, but not to please them or excuse them in their wickedness.</note> patient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>In meekness instructing those that <note>He means those who do not yet see the truth.</note> oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>And come to amendement out of that snare of the deuil, of whom they are taken prisoners, to doe his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>This <note>The seventh admonition: we may not hope for a Church in this world without corruption: but there will be rather great abundance of most wicked men even in the very bosom of the Church, who will nonetheless make a show and countenance of great holiness, and charity.</note> know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, <note>Who make no account, either of right or honesty.</note> unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>Without naturall affection, truce breakers, false accusers, intemperate, fierce, no louers at all of them which are good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>Traitours, headie, high minded, louers of pleasures more then louers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: <note>We must not tarry with those men who resist the truth not from simple ignorance, but from a perverse mind, (which thing appears by their fruits which he graphically displays here); rather, we must turn away from them.</note> from such turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>For of this sort are they which creepe into houses, and leade captiue simple women laden with sinnes, and led with diuers lustes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>Which women are euer learning, and are neuer able to come to the acknowledging of the trueth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>And as Iannes and Iambres withstoode Moses, so doe these also resist the trueth, men of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>
          <note>He adds a comfort: the Lord will at length take off all their masks.</note>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as theirs also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>
          <note>So that we are not deceived by such hypocrites, we must set before us the virtues of the holy servants of God, and we must not be afraid of persecution which they suffered willingly, and which always follows true godliness. But we must especially hold fast the doctrine of the apostles, the sum of which is this, that we are saved through faith in Christ Jesus.</note>But thou hast <note>You thoroughly know not only what I taught and did, but also how I thought and was inclined.</note> fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at <note>Which is in Pisidia.</note> Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them] all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yea, and all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and seducers shall wax <note>Their wickedness will daily increase.</note> worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But continue thou in the thinges which thou hast learned, and which are committed vnto thee, knowing of who thou hast learned them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that thou hast knowen the holy Scriptures of a childe, which are able to make thee wise vnto saluation, through the faith which is in Christ Iesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>
          <note>The eighth admonition which is most precious: a pastor must be wise by the word of God alone: in which we have perfectly delivered to us, whatever pertains to discerning, knowing and establishing true opinions, and to prove which opinions are false: and furthermore, to correct evil manners, and to establish good.</note>All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>That the <note>The Prophets and expounders of God's will are properly and distinctly called, men of God.</note> man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I <note>The principal and chief of all admonitions, being therefore proposed with a most earnest charge, is this: that the word of God is explained and set forth with a certain holy urgent exhorting, as necessity requires: but in such a way that a good and true ground of the doctrine is laid, and the vehemency is tempered with all holy meekness.</note> charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Preach the worde: be instant, in season and out of season: improue, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>
          <note>Faithful pastors in times past took all occasions they could, because men were very prompt and ready to return to their fables.</note>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto <note>To false and unprofitable doctrines which the world is now so bewitched with, that it would rather have the open light of the truth completely put out, than it would come out of darkness.</note> fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>
          <note>The wickedness and falling away of the world ought to cause faithful ministers to be so much the more careful.</note>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, <note>Prove and show by good and substantial proof, that you are the true minister of God.</note> make full proof of thy ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>
          <note>He foretells his death to be at hand, and sets before them an excellent example, both of invincible constancy, and sure hope.</note>For I am now ready to be <note>To be offered for a drink offering: and he alludes to the pouring out of blood or wine which was used in sacrifices.</note> offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I haue fought a good fight, and haue finished my course: I haue kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>For hence foorth is laide vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lorde the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue that his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>
          <note>The last part of the epistle, setting forth grievous complaints against certain ones, and examples of singular godliness in every place, and of a mind never wearied.</note>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For Demas hath forsaken me, having <note>Contented himself with this world.</note> loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Onely Luke is with me. Take Marke and bring him with thee: for he is profitable vnto me to minister.</verse>
