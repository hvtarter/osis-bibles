      <chapter osisID='Zeph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.1'>The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. <note>The Argument - Seeing the great rebellion of the people, and that there was now no hope of amendment, he gives notice of the great judgment of God, which was at hand, showing that their country would be utterly destroyed, and they would be carried away captives by the Babylonians. Yet for the comfort of the faithful he prophesied of God's vengeance against their enemies, such as the Philistines, Moabites, Assyrians, and others, to assure them that God had a continual care over them. And as the wicked would be punished for their sins and transgressions, so he exhorts the godly to patience, and to trust to find mercy by reason of the free promise of God made to Abraham: and therefore quietly to wait until God shows them the effect of that grace, by which in the end they should be gathered to him, and counted as his people and children.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.2'>I will surely destroy all things from off the land, saith the Lorde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.3'>I will consume man and beast; I will consume the <note>Not that God was angry with these dumb creatures, but because man was so wicked for whose cause they were created, God makes them to take part of the punishments with him.</note> fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.4'>I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, [and] the name of the <note>Who were an order of superstitious priests appointed to minister in the service of Baal, and were as his special chaplains; read (2Ki_23:5; Hos_10:5).</note> Chemarims with the priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.5'>And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship [and] that swear by the LORD, and that swear by <note>He alludes to their idol Molech, which was forbidden; read (Lev_20:2), yet they called him their king, and made him as a god: therefore he here notes those that will both say they worship God, and yet will swear by idols and serve them: which faltering is here condemned, as in (Eze_20:39; 1Ki_18:21; 2Ki_17:33).</note> Malcham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.6'>And them that are turned backe from the Lord, and those that haue not sought the Lorde, nor inquired for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.7'>Be stil at the presence of the Lord God: for the day of the Lord is at hand: for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, and hath sanctified his ghests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.8'>And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with <note>Meaning, the courtiers, who did imitate the strange apparel of other nations to win their favour by it, and to appear glorious in the eyes of all others; read (Eze_23:14-15).</note> strange apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.9'>In the same day also will I punish all those that <note>He means the servants of the rulers who invade other men's houses, and rejoice and leap for joy, when they can get any gain to please their master with.</note> leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.10'>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, [that there shall be] the noise of a cry from the <note>Signifying that all the corners of the city of Jerusalem would be full of trouble.</note> fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.11'>Howl, ye inhabitants of <note>This is meant of the street of the merchants which was lower than the rest of the place around it.</note> Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.12'>And it shall come to pass at that time, [that] I will search Jerusalem with <note>So that nothing will escape me.</note> candles, and punish the men that are settled <note>By their prosperity they are hardened in their wickedness.</note> on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.13'>Therefore their goods shall be spoyled, and their houses waste: they shall also build houses, but not inhabite them, and they shall plant vineyards, but not drinke the wine thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.14'>The great day of the LORD [is] near, [it is] near, and hasteth greatly, [even] the voice of the day of the LORD: <note>They that trusted in their own strength and condemned the Prophets of God.</note> the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.15'>That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and heauinesse, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of obscuritie and darkenesse, a day of cloudes and blackenesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.16'>A day of the trumpet and alarme against the strong cities, and against the hie towres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.17'>And I will bring distresse vpon men, that they shall walke like blind men, because they haue sinned against the Lorde, and their blood shall be powred out as dust, and their flesh as the dongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.1.18'>Neither their siluer nor their golde shalbe able to deliuer them in ye day of the Lords wrath, but the whole lande shalbe deuoured by the fire of his ielousie: for hee shall make euen a speedie riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Zeph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.1'>Gather <note>He exhorts them to repentance, and wills them to descend into themselves and gather themselves, lest they be scattered like chaff.</note> yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.2'>Before the decree come foorth, and ye be as chaffe that passeth in a day, and before the fierce wrath of the Lord come vpon you, and before the day of the Lords anger come vpon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.3'>Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which <note>That is, who have lived uprightly and godly according as he prescribes by his word.</note> have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.4'>For <note>He comforts the faithful in that God would change his punishments from them to the Philistines their enemies, and other nations.</note> Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.5'>Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea <note>That is, Galilee: by these nations he means the people that dwelt near to the Jews, and instead of friendship were their enemies: therefore he calls them Canaanites, whom the Lord appointed to be slain.</note> coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD [is] against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.6'>And the sea coast shal be dwellings and cotages for shepheardes and sheepefoldes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.7'>And the coast shall be for the <note>He shows why God would destroy their enemies, because their country would be a resting place for his Church.</note> remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.8'>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and <note>These nations presumed to take from the Jews that country which the Lord had given them.</note> magnified [themselves] against their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.9'>Therefore, as I liue, saith the Lord of hostes, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall bee as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorah, euen the breeding of nettels and salt pittes, and a perpetuall desolation: the residue of my folke shall spoyle them, and the remnant of my people shall possesse them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.10'>This shall they haue for their pride, because they haue reproched and magnified themselues against the Lord of hostes people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.11'>The LORD [will be] terrible unto them: <note>When he will deliver his people and destroy their enemies and idols, his glory will shine throughout all the world.</note> for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and [men] shall worship him, every one from his place, [even] all the isles of the heathen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.12'>Ye Morians also shalbe slaine by my sword with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.13'>And he wil stretch out his hand against the North, and destroy Asshur, and will make Nineueh desolate, and waste like a wildernesse.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.2.15'>This [is] the <note>Meaning, Nineveh, which rejoicing so much of her strength and prosperity, should be thus made waste, and God's people delivered.</note> rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I [am], and [there is] none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, [and] wag his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.1'>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing <note>That is, Jerusalem.</note> city!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.2'>She heard not the voyce: she receiued not correction: she trusted not in the Lord: she drew not neere to her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.3'>Her princes within her [are] roaring lions; her judges [are] evening wolves; they <note>They are so greedy, that they eat up bones and all.</note> gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.4'>Her prophets are light, and wicked persons: her priests haue polluted the Sanctuarie: they haue wrested the Lawe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.5'>The <note>The wicked thus boasted that God was ever among them, but the Prophet answers that that cannot excuse their wickedness: for God will not bear with their sins. Yet he did patiently abide and sent his Prophets continually to call them to repentance, but he profited nothing.</note> just LORD [is] in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.6'>I have <note>By the destruction of other nations he shows that the Jews should have learned to fear God.</note> cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.7'>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but <note>They were most earnest and ready to do wickedly.</note> they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.8'>Therefore <note>Seeing that you will not repent, you can expect my vengeance as well as other nations.</note> wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zeph.3.9'>For <note>Lest any should then think that God's glory should have perished when Judah was destroyed, he shows that he will proclaim his grace through all the world.</note> then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</verse>
