      <chapter osisID='Obad.1'>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.1'>The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; <note>God has certainly revealed to his prophets, that he will raise up the heathen to destroy the Edomites, concerning which the rumour is now proclaimed; (Jer_49:14).</note> We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and <note>Thus the heathen encourage themselves to rise against Edom.</note> let us rise up against her in battle. <note>The Argument - The Idumeans, who came from Esau, were mortal enemies always to the Israelites, who came from Jacob, and therefore did not only vex them continually with various types of cruelty, but also stirred up others to fight against them. Therefore when they were now in their greatest prosperity, and did most triumph against Israel, which was in great affliction and misery, God raised up his Prophet to comfort the Israelites. For God had now determined to destroy their adversaries, who did so severely vex them, and to send them those who would deliver them, and set up the kingdom of the Messiah which he had promised.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.2'>Beholde, I haue made thee smal among the heathen: thou art vtterly despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.3'>The <note>Which despises all others in respect of yourself, and yet you are but a handful in comparison with others, and you are shut up among the hills as separate from the rest of the world.</note> pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation [is] high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.4'>Though thou exalt thy selfe as the egle, and make thy nest among the starres, thence will I bring thee downe, sayth the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.5'>
          <note>God will so destroy them that he will leave none, even though thieves when they come take but until they have enough, and they that gather grapes always leave some behind them. {{See Jer_49:9}}</note>If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave [some] grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.6'>Howe are the things of Esau sought vp, and his treasures searched?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.7'>All the men of thy confederacy <note>Those in whom you trusted to have help and friendship, will be your enemies and destroy you.</note> have brought thee [even] to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, [and] prevailed against thee; [they that eat] thy <note>That is, your familiar friends and guests have by secret practices destroyed you.</note> bread have laid a wound under thee: [there is] none understanding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.8'>Shall not I in that day, saith the Lorde, euen destroy the wise men out of Edom, and vnderstanding from the mount of Esau?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.9'>And thy strong men, O Teman, shall bee afraide, because euery one of the mount of Esau shalbe cut off by slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.10'>For [thy] violence against thy <note>He shows the reason why the Edomites were so severely punished: that is, because they were enemies to his Church, whom he now comforts by punishing their enemies.</note> brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.11'>In the day that thou stoodest <note>When Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem, you joined with him, and had part of the spoil, and so rejoiced when my people (that is, your brother), were afflicted, whereas you should have pitied and helped your brother.</note> on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou [wast] as one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became <note>When the Lord deprived them of their former dignity, and delivered them to be carried into captivity.</note> a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>Thou shouldest not haue entred into the gate of my people, in the day of their destruction, neither shouldest thou haue once looked on their affliction in the day of their destruction, nor haue layde hands on their substance in the day of their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.14'>Neyther shouldest thou haue stande in the crosse wayes to cut off them, that shoulde escape, neither shouldest thou haue shut vp the remnant thereof in the day of affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.15'>For the day <note>When he will summon all the heathen, and send them to destroy you.</note> of the LORD [is] near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.16'>For as ye have <note>That is, rejoiced and triumphed.</note> drunk upon my holy mountain, [so] shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be <note>The Edomites will be utterly destroyed, and yet in spite of all the enemies I will reserve my Church and restore it.</note> as though they had not been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.17'>But vpon mount Zion shalbe deliuerance, and it shalbe holy, and the house of Iaakob shall possesse their possessions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.18'>And the house of Jacob shall be <note>God attributes this power to consume his enemies to his Church, which power properly belongs only to himself; (Isa_10:17; Deu_4:24; Heb_12:29).</note> a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be [any] remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.19'>And [they of] the south shall possess the <note>He describes how the Church will be enlarged and have great possessions: but this is mainly accomplished under Christ, when that faithful are made heirs and lords of all things by him who is their head.</note> mount of Esau; and [they of] the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin [shall possess] Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.20'>And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel [shall possess] that of the <note>By the Canaanites, the Jews mean the Dutchmen, and by Zarephath, France, and by Sepharad, Spain.</note> Canaanites, [even] unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which [is] in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.21'>And <note>Meaning that God will raise up in his Church those who will rule and govern for the defence of it, and for the destruction of his enemies under the Messiah, whom the Prophet here calls the Lord and head of this kingdom.</note> saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.</verse>
