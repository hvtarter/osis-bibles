      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of <note>Who was the son of Histaspis.</note> Darius, came the word of the LORD unto <note>This was not the Zechariah, of which mention is made in (2Ch_24:20), but he had the same name, and is called the son of Berechiah, as he was, because he came of those progenitors, as of Joiada or Berechiah, and Iddo.</note> Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, <note>The Argument - Two months after Haggai had begun to prophesy, Zechariah was also sent of the Lord to help him in the labour, and to confirm the same doctrine. First therefore, he puts them in remembrance for what reason God had so severely punished their fathers: and yet comforts them if they will truly repent, and not abuse this great benefit of God in their deliverance which was a figure of that true deliverance, that all the faithful should have from death and sin, by Christ. But because they remained still in their wickedness, and lack of desire to set forth God's glory, and were not yet made better by their long banishment, he rebukes them most sharply: yet for the comfort of the repentant, he ever mixes the promise of grace, that they might by this means be prepared to receive Christ, in whom all should be sanctified to the Lord.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The LORD hath been <note>He speaks this to make them afraid of God's judgments, so that they should not provoke him as their fathers had done, whom he so grievously punished.</note> sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; <note>Let your fruits declare that you are God's people, and that he has wrought in you by his Spirit, and mortified you: for otherwise man has no power to return to God, but God must convert him; (Jer_31:18; Lam_5:21) {{See Isa_31:6}}</note> Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be ye not as your fathers, vnto whome the former prophets haue cried, saying, Thus sayth the Lord of hostes, Turne you nowe from your euill wayes, and from your wicked workes: but they would not heare, nor hearken vnto me, saith the Lorde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where <note>Though your fathers are dead, yet God's judgments in punishing them ought still to be before your eyes: and though the prophets are dead, yet their doctrine remains for ever; (2Pe_1:15).</note> [are] they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of <note>Seeing you saw the force of my doctrine in punishing your fathers, why do you not fear the threatenings contained in the same, and declared by my Prophets?</note> your fathers? and <note>As men astonished with my judgments, and not that they were touched with true repentance.</note> they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which [is] the month <note>Which includes part of January and part of February.</note> Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I <note>This vision signifies the restoration of the Church: but as yet it would not appear to man's eyes, which is here meant by the night, by the bottom, and by the myrtle trees, which are black, and give a dark shadow. Yet he compares God to a King who has his posts and messengers abroad, by whom he still works his purpose and brings his matters to pass.</note> saw by night, and behold <note>Who was the chief among the rest of the horsemen.</note> a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that [were] in the bottom; and behind him [were there] <note>These signify the various offices of God's angels, by whom God sometimes punishes, and sometimes comforts, and brings forth his works in various ways.</note> red horses, speckled, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then sayd I, O my Lorde, what are these? And the Angel that talked with me, sayde vnto me, I wil shew thee what these be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the mirre trees, answered, and sayd, These are they whome the Lord hath sent to go through the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the Angel of the Lord, that stood among the mirre trees, and sayd, We haue gone thorowe the world: and beholde, all the world sitteth still, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the <note>That is, Christ the mediator prayed for the salvation of his Church, which was now troubled, when all the countries about them were at rest.</note> angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the Lorde answered the Angel that talked with me, with good wordes and comfortable wordes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel that talked with me said to me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am <note>Though for a time God defers his help and comfort from his Church, yet this declares that he still loves them most dearly, as a most merciful father his children, or a husband his wife, and when it is expedient for them, his help is ever ready.</note> jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very greatly displeased with the nations [that are] at ease: for I was but <note>In destroying the reprobate, I showed myself but a little angry toward my Church, but the enemy would have destroyed them also, and did not consider the goal of my chastisements.</note> a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line <note>To measure out the buildings.</note> shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet <note>The abundance will be so great, that the places of storage will not be able to contain these blessings that God will send, but will even break because of fullness.</note> be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold <note>Which signifies all the enemies of the Church: east, west, north, and south.</note> four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said vnto the Angel that talked with me, What be these? And hee answered me, These are the hornes which haue scattered Iudah, Israel, and Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the LORD showed me four <note>These craftsmen or smiths are God's instruments, who with their mallets and hammers break these hard and strong horns which would overthrow the Church, and declare that no enemies' horn is so strong, but God has a hammer to break it in pieces.</note> craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then said I, What come these to doe? And he answered, and said, These are the hornes, which haue scattered Iudah, so that a man durst not lift vp his head: but these are come to fray them, and to cast out the hornes of the Gentiles, which lift vp their horne ouer the land of Iudah, to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a <note>This is the angel who was Christ: for in respect of his office he is often called an angel, but in respect of his eternal essence, is God, and so called.</note> man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then saide I, Whither goest thou? And he saide vnto me, To measure Ierusalem, that I may see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And beholde, the Angel that talked with me, went foorth: and another Angel went out to meete him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>And said to him, Run, speak to this <note>Meaning himself, Zechariah.</note> young man, saying, <note>Signifying the spiritual Jerusalem and Church under Christ, which would be extended by the Gospel through all the world, and would need no material walls, nor trust in any worldly strength, but would be safely preserved and dwell in peace among all their enemies.</note> Jerusalem shall be inhabited [as] towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, saith the LORD, will be to her a wall of <note>To defend my Church, to strike fear in the enemies, and to destroy them if they approach near.</note> fire on every side, and will <note>In me they will have their full felicity and glory.</note> be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, [come <note>He calls to those who partly for fear, and partly for their own case, remained still in captivity, and so preferred their own personal benefits to the benefits of God promised in his Church.</note> forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four <note>As it was I that scattered you, so I have power to restore you.</note> winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>
          <note>By fleeing from Babylon, and coming to the Church.</note>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the <note>Seeing that God had begun to show his grace among you by delivering you, he continues the same still toward you, and therefore sends me his angel and his Christ to defend you from your enemies, so that they will not hurt you, neither along the way nor at home.</note> glory hath he sent me to the nations which wasted you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the <note>You are so dear to God, that he can no more allow your enemies to hurt you, than a man can endure to be thrust in the eye; (Psa_17:8).</note> apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, behold, I will shake my hand <note>Upon the heathen your enemies.</note> upon them, and <note>They will be your servants, as you have been theirs.</note> they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath <note>This must necessarily be understood of Christ, who being God equal with his Father, was sent, as he was Mediator to dwell in his Church and to govern them.</note> sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Reioyce, and be glad, O daughter Zion: for loe, I come, and will dwell in the middes of thee, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall be ioyned to the Lord in that day, and shalbe my people: and I will dwell in the middes of thee, and thou shalt knowe that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the Lord shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy lande, and shall chuse Ierusalem againe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Let all flesh be still before the Lord: for he is raised vp out of his holy place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest <note>He prayed to Christ the Mediator for the state of the Church.</note> standing before the angel of the LORD, and <note>Which declares that the faithful do not only war with flesh and blood, but with Satan himself, and spiritual wickedness; (Eph_6:12).</note> Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the <note>That is, Christ speaks to God as the mediator of his Church, that he would rebuke Satan: and here he shows himself to be the continual preserver of his Church.</note> LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: [is] not this a <note>Meaning that Joshua was wonderfully preserved in the captivity, and now Satan sought to afflict and trouble him when he was doing his office.</note> brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with <note>With regard to the glorious garments and precious stones that the priests wore before the captivity: and by this contemptible state the Prophet signifies, that these small beginnings would be made excellent when Christ will make the full restitution of his Church.</note> filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the <note>{{See Zec_3:3}}</note> filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have <note>He shows of what apparel he speaks, which is, when our filthy sins are taken away, and we are clothed with God's mercies, which refers to the spiritual restitution.</note> caused thy iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them <note>The Prophet prays that besides the raiment, the Priest might also have attire for his head accordingly, that is, that the dignity of the priesthood might be perfect: and this was fulfilled in Christ, who was both Priest and King. And here all those are condemned, that can content themselves with any average reformation in religion, seeing the Prophet desires the perfection, and obtains it.</note> set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the Angel of the Lorde testified vnto Iehoshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also <note>That is, have rule and government in my Church, as your predecessors have had.</note> judge my house, and shalt also keep my <note>By which he means to have the whole charge and ministry of the Church.</note> courts, and I will give thee places to walk among <note>That is, the angels, who represented the whole number of the faithful: signifying that all the godly would willingly receive him.</note> these that stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <note>Because they follow my word, they are condemned in the world, and esteemed as monsters. {{See Isa_8:18}}</note> [are] men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the <note>That is, Christ, who did so humble himself, that he not only became the servant of God, but also the servant of men: and therefore in him they should have comfort, even though in the world they are condemned; (Isa_11:1) (Jer_23:5; Jer_33:14-15).</note> BRANCH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold the <note>He shows that the ministers cannot build before God lay the first stone, which is Christ, who is full of eyes, both because he gives light to all others, and that all ought to seek light from him; (Zec_4:10).</note> stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone [shall be] seven eyes: behold, I <note>That is, I will make perfect in all points, as a thing done by the hand of God.</note> will engrave the engraving of it, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will <note>Though I have punished this land for a time, yet I will even now be pacified, and punish their sins no more.</note> remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the <note>You will then live in peace and quietness, that is, in the kingdom of Christ; (Isa_2:2; Mic_4:4; Hag_2:9).</note> vine and under the fig tree.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Moreouer, the word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who hath despised the day of <note>Signifying that all were discouraged at the small and poor beginnings of the temple.</note> small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the <note>By which he signifies the plummet and line, that is, that Zerubbabel who represented Christ, would go forward with his building to the joy and comfort of the godly, though the world was against him, and though his own for a while were discouraged, because they do not see things pleasant to the eye.</note> plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel [with] those seven; <note>That is, God has seven eyes: meaning, a continual providence, so that neither Satan nor any power in the world, can go about to bring anything to pass to hinder his work; (Zec_5:9).</note> they [are] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then answered I, and said vnto him, What are these two oliue trees vpon the right and vpon the left side thereof?</verse>
