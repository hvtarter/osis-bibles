  <div type='book' osisID='1Kgs'>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was <note>He was about 70 years old, (2Sa_5:4).</note> old [and] stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no <note>For his natural heat was worn away with travels.</note> heat. <note>The Argument - Because the children of God should expect no continual rest and quietness in this world, the Holy Spirit sets before our eyes in this book the variety and change of things, which came to the people of Israel from the death of David, Solomon, and the rest of the kings, to the death of Ahab. Declaring that flourishing kingdoms, unless they are preserved by God's protection, (who then favours them when his word is truly set forth, virtue esteemed, vice punished, and concord maintained) fall to decay and come to nothing as appears by the dividing of the kingdom under Rehoboam and Jeroboam, who were one people before and now by the just punishment of God were made two. Judah and Benjamin were under Rehoboam, and this was called the kingdom of Judah. The other ten tribes held with Jeroboam, and this was called the kingdom of Israel. The king of Judah had his throne in Jerusalem, and the king of Israel in Samaria, after it was built by Omri Ahab's father. Because our Saviour Christ according to the flesh, comes from the stock of David, the genealogy of the kings of Judah is here described, from Solomon to Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, who reigned over Judah in Jerusalem as Ahab did over Israel in Samaria.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Wherefore his seruants saide vnto him, Let there be sought for my lord ye King a yong virgin, and let her stand before the King, and cherish him: and let her lie in thy bosome, that my lord the King may get heate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag <note>A city in the tribe of Issachar, (Jos_19:18).</note> a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the maid was exceeding faire, and cherished the King, and ministred to him, but the King knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and <note>Read (2Sa_15:1).</note> fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father would not displease him from his childehood, to say, Why hast thou done so? And hee was a very goodly man, and his mother bare him next after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah <note>They took his part and followed him.</note> helped [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the Priest, &amp; Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the men of might, which were with Dauid, were not with Adoniiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>Then Adoniiah sacrificed sheepe and oxen, and fat cattel by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the kings sonnes, &amp; al the men of Iudah ye Kings seruants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and <note>As the Cherethites and Pelethites.</note> the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Salomon, saying, Hast thou not heard, that Adoniiah ye sonne of Haggith doeth reigne, and Dauid our lord knoweth it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own <note>For Adonijah will destroy you and your son, if he reigns.</note> life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Didest not thou, my lorde, O King, sweare vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomo thy sonne shall reigne after me, &amp; he shal sit vpon my throne? why is then Adoniiah King?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and <note>By declaring such things, as may further the same.</note> confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber, and the King was verie olde, and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto ye King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bath-sheba bowed and made obeisance vnto the King; the King saide, What is thy matter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And shee answered him, My lorde, thou swarest by the Lorde thy God vnto thine handmaide, saying, Assuredly Salomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest <note>The king being worn with age, could not attend to the affairs of the realm, and also Adonijah had many who kept it from the king.</note> [it] not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he hath offred many oxen, and fatte cattel, and sheepe, and hath called all the sonnes of the King, and Abiathar the Priest, and Ioab the captaine of the hoste: but Salomon thy seruant hath he not bidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lorde, O King, knowest that the eyes of all Israel are on thee, that thou shouldest tell them, who shoulde sit on the throne of my lord the King after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be <note>And so put to death as wicked transgressors.</note> counted offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And lo, while she yet talked with the King, Nathan also the Prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face <note>Acknowledging him to be the true and worthy king appointed by God, as the figure of his Christ.</note> to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan saide, My lorde, O King, hast thou said, Adoniiah shall reigne after mee, and he shall sit vpon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For hee is gone downe this day, and hath slaine many oxen, and fat cattel, and sheepe, and hath called al the Kings sonnes, and the captaines of the hoste, and Abiathar the Priest: and behold, they eate and drinke before him, and say, God saue King Adoniiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me thy seruant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and thy seruant Salomon hath he not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed [it] unto thy <note>Meaning, that in such affairs he should undertake nothing unless he had consulted with the Lord.</note> servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then King Dauid answered, and saide, Call me Bath-sheba; shee came into ye Kings presence, and stoode before the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the King sware, saying, As the Lorde liueth, who hath redeemed my soule out of all aduersitie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>Even as I <note>Moved by the Spirit of God to do so, because he foresaw that Solomon would be the figure of Christ.</note> sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bath-sheba bowed her face to the earth, and did reuerence vnto the King, and said, God saue my lord King Dauid for euer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And King Dauid saide, Call mee Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada; they came before the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>The king also said unto them, Take with you the <note>Meaning, the king's servants and such as were of his guard.</note> servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet anoint him there King ouer Israel, and blowe ye the trumpet, and say, God saue king Salomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then come vp after him, that hee may come and sit vpon my throne: and hee shall bee King in my steade: for I haue appointed him to be prince ouer Israel and ouer Iudah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>Then Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada answered the King, and said, So be it, and the Lord God of my lord the King ratifie it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the Lord hath bene with my lorde the King, so be he with Salomon, and exalt his throne aboue the throne of my lorde king Dauid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went downe and caused Salomon to ride vpon king Dauids mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took an horn of <note>With which they were accustomed to anoint the priests and the holy instruments, (Exo_30:23).</note> oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came vp after him, and the people piped with pipes, and reioyced with great ioye, so that the earth rang with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adoniiah and all the ghestes that were with him, heard it: (and they had made an ende of eating) and when Ioab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What meaneth this noise and vprore in the citie?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou [art] a valiant man, and bringest <note>He praised Jonathan, thinking to have heard good news but God wrought things contrary to his expectation, and so beat down his pride.</note> good tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Ionathan answered, and said to Adoniiah, Verely our lord King Dauid hath made Salomon King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the King hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they haue caused him to ride vpon the Kings mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan ye Prophet haue anointed him King in Gihon: and they are gone vp from thence with ioy, and the citie is moued: this is the noise that ye haue heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And Salomon also sitteth on the throne of the kingdome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the <note>He gave God thanks for the good success.</note> bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And thus sayd the King also, Blessed bee the Lorde God of Israel, who hath made one to sit on my throne this day, euen in my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>Then all the ghestes that were with Adonijah, were afraide, and rose vp, and went euery man his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the <note>Which David his father had built in the floor of Araunah, (2Sa_24:25).</note> altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And one tolde Salomon, saying, Beholde, Adonijah doeth feare King Salomon: for lo, he hath caught holde on the hornes of the altar, saying, Let King Salomon sweare vnto me this day, that he will not slay his seruant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>Then Salomon sayd, If he will shewe him selfe a worthy man, there shall not an heare of him fall to the earth, but if wickednes be found in him, he shall dye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>Then King Salomon sent, &amp; they brought him from the altar, and he came and did obeisance vnto King Salomon; Salomon sayde vnto him, Go to thine house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Then the dayes of Dauid drewe neere that he should die, and hee charged Salomon his sonne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I go the <note>I am ready to die as all men must.</note> way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And keep the <note>He shows how hard it is to govern and that no one can do it well except he obey God.</note> charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in <note>Without hypocrisy.</note> truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, [and] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and <note>He shed his blood in time of peace, as if there had been war.</note> shed the blood of war in peace, and <note>He put the bloody sword into his sheath.</note> put the blood of war upon his girdle that [was] about his loins, and in his shoes that [were] on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Doe therefore according to thy wisdome, and let thou not his hoare head go downe to the graue in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: <note>That is, they dealt mercifully with me.</note> for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And beholde, with thee is Shimei the sonne of Gera, the sonne of Iemini, of Bahurim, which cursed mee with an horrible curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but hee came downe to meete me at Iorden, &amp; I sware to him by the Lorde, saying, I will not slay thee with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou [art] a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with <note>Let him be punished with death, see (1Ki_2:46).</note> blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>So Dauid slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the dayes which Dauid reigned vpon Israel, were fourtie yeeres: seuen yeeres reigned he in Hebron, and thirtie &amp; three yeeres reigned he in Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Then sate Salomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was stablished mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, <note>For she was afraid lest he would work treason against the king.</note> Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreouer, I haue a sute vnto thee; she sayd, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and [that] all Israel <note>In sign of their favour and consent.</note> set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>Nowe therefore I aske thee one request, refuse me not; she said vnto him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he sayd, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Salomon ye King, (for he will not say thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bath-sheba sayd, Well, I will speake for thee vnto the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and <note>In token of reverence, and that others by his example might have her in greater honour.</note> bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she sayd, I desire a small request of thee, say me not nay. Then the King sayde vnto her, Aske on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>She sayd then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the <note>Meaning, that if he would have granted Abishag, who was so dear to his father, he would later have aspired for the kingdom.</note> kingdom also; for he [is] mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then King Salomon sware by the Lorde, saying, God doe so to me and more also, if Adoniiah hath not spoken this worde against his owne life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore as ye Lord liueth, who hath established me, &amp; set me on the throne of Dauid my father, who also hath made me an house, as he promised, Adoniiah shall surely die this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and hee smote him that he dyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou [art] worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou <note>When he fled before Absalom, (2Sa_15:24).</note> barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Salomon cast out Abiathar from being Priest vnto the Lord, that he might fulfill the wordes of the Lord, which he spake against the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had <note>He took Adonijah's part when he would have usurped the kingdom (1Ki_1:7).</note> turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, [he is] by the <note>Thinking to be saved by the holiness of the place.</note> altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, &amp; sayd vnto him, Thus sayth the King, Come out; he sayde, Nay, but I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the King worde againe, saying, Thus sayd Ioab, &amp; thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and <note>For it was lawful to take the wilful murderer from the altar, (Exo_21:14).</note> fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And the Lorde shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, &amp; my father Dauid knew not: to wit, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captaine of the hoste of Iudah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>Their blood shall therefore return upon the <note>Joab will be justly punished for the blood that he has cruelly shed.</note> head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</verse>
