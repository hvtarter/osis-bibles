      <chapter osisID='Joel.1'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. <note>The Argument - The Prophet Joel first rebukes those of Judah, that being now punished with a great plague of famine, still remain obstinate. Secondly, he threatens greater plagues, because they grow daily to a more hardness of heart and rebellion against God in spite of his punishments. Thirdly, he exhorts them to repentance, showing that it must be earnest, and proceed from the heart, because they had grievously offended God. And in doing this, Joel promises that God will be merciful, and not forget his covenant that he made with their fathers, but will send his Christ, who will gather the scattered sheep, and restore them to life and liberty, even though they seem to be dead.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>Hear this, ye <note>Signifying the princes, the priests, and the governors.</note> old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath <note>He calls the Jews to the consideration of God's judgments, who had now plagued the fruits of the ground for the space of four years, which was because of their sins, and to call them to repentance.</note> this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>Tell you your children of it, and let your children shew to their children, and their children to another generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>That which is left of ye palmer worme, hath the grashopper eaten, &amp; the residue of ye grashopper hath the canker worme eaten, and the residue of the canker worme hath the caterpiller eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>Awake, ye <note>Meaning, that the reason for their excess and drunkenness was taken away.</note> drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>For <note>This was another plague with which God had punished them when he stirred up the Assyrians against them.</note> a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth [are] the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>He maketh my vine waste, &amp; pilleth off the barke of my figge tree: he maketh it bare, and casteth it downe: ye branches therof are made white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the <note>Mourn grievously as a woman who has lost her husband, to whom she has been married in her youth.</note> husband of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>The meat offering and the drink offering is <note>The signs of God's wrath appeared in his temple, in so much that God's service was discontinued.</note> cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: <note>All comfort and substance for nourishment is taken away.</note> the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>Be ye ashamed, O husband men: howle, O ye vine dressers for the wheate, and for the barly, because the haruest of the fielde is perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>The vine is dried vp, and the figge tree is decayed: the pomegranate tree &amp; the palme tree, and the apple tree, euen all the trees of the fielde are withered: surely the ioy is withered away from the sonnes of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>
          <note>He shows that the only means to avoid God's wrath, and to have all things restored, is true repentance.</note>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>Sanctifie you a fast: call a solemne assemblie: gather the Elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the House of the Lorde your God, and cry vnto the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>Alas for the day! for the <note>We see by these great plagues that utter destruction is at hand.</note> day of the LORD [is] at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>Is not the meate cut off before our eyes? &amp; ioy, and gladnesse from the house of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>The seede is rotten vnder their cloddes: the garners are destroyed: the barnes are broken downe, for the corne is withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>How did the beasts mourne! the herdes of cattel pine away, because they haue no pasture, &amp; the flockes of sheepe are destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>O Lord, to thee will I crie: for the fire hath deuoured the pastures of the wildernesse, and the flame hath burnt vp all the trees of the fielde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the <note>That is, drought.</note> fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Blow ye <note>He shows the great judgments of God which are at hand, unless they repent.</note> the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for [it is] nigh at hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>A <note>Of affliction and trouble.</note> day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a <note>Meaning, the Assyrians.</note> great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, [even] to the years of many generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land [is] as the garden of <note>The enemy destroyed our plentiful country, wherever he went.</note> Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>The beholding of him is like the sight of horses, &amp; like the horsemen, so shal they runne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>Like the noyse of charrets in the toppes of the mountaines shal they leape, like the noyse of a flame of fire that deuoureth the stubble, and as a mightie people prepared to the battel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces <note>They will be pale and black because of fear, as in (Nah_2:10).</note> shall gather blackness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>They shal runne like strong men, and goe vp to the wall like men of warre, and euery man shall goe forward in his wayes, and they shall not stay in their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>Neither shall one <note>For none will be able to resist them.</note> thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and [when] they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>They shal runne to &amp; fro in the citie: they shal runne vpon the wall: they shal clime vp vpon the houses, &amp; enter in at ye windowes like ye thiefe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the <note>Read (Joe_2:31; Isa_13:10; Eze_32:7; Joe_3:15; Mat_24:29)</note> sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>And the LORD shall <note>The Lord will stir up the Assyrians to execute his judgments.</note> utter his voice before his army: for his camp [is] very great: for [he is] strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD [is] great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>Therefore also now the Lord sayth, Turne you vnto me with all your heart, &amp; with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>And <note>Mortify your affections and serve God with pureness of heart, and not with ceremonies.</note> rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he [is] gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>Who knoweth [if] he will <note>He speaks this to stir up their slothfulness, and not that he doubted of God's mercies, if they did repent. For the way in which God repents, {{See Jer_18:8}}</note> return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; [even] a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>Blowe the trumpet in Zion, sanctifie a fast, call a solemne assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the <note>That as all have sinned, so all may show forth signs of their repentance, so that men seeing the children who are not free from God's wrath, might be the more deeply touched with the consideration of their own sins.</note> children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>Let the Priestes, the ministers of the Lord weepe betweene the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and giue not thine heritage into reproche that the heathen should rule ouer them. Wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>Then will the LORD be <note>If they repent he shows that God will preserve and defend them with a most fervent affection.</note> jealous for his land, and pity his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>Yea, the Lord wil answere and say vnto his people, Beholde, I will send you corne, and wine, and oyle, and you shalbe satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproche among the heathen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>But I will remove far off from you the <note>That is, the Assyrians your enemies.</note> northern [army], and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the <note>Called the Salt Sea, or Persian Sea: meaning, that even though this army was so great that it filled all from this sea to the Mediterranean Sea, yet he would scatter them.</note> east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>Feare not, O land, but be glad, and reioyce: for the Lord wil do great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>Be not afrayde, ye beastes of the fielde: for the pastures of the wildernesse are greene: for the tree beareth her fruite: the figge tree &amp; the vine do giue their force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain <note>That is, such as would come by just measure, and would be sent when God was reconciled with them.</note> moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first [month].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>And the barnes shalbe full of wheate, and the presses shal abound with wine and oyle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>And I will render you the yeeres that the grashopper hath eaten, the canker worme and the caterpiller and the palmer worme, my great hoste which I sent among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>So you shal eate and be satisfied and praise the Name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt marueilously with you: and my people shal neuer be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>Ye shal also know, that I am in the middes of Israel, and that I am the Lorde your God and none other, &amp; my people shal neuer be ashamed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'>And also vpon the seruants, and vpon the maydes in those dayes wil I powre my Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'>And I will shew <note>He warns the faithful what terrible things would come, with the intent that they should not look for continual quietness in this world: and yet in all these troubles he would preserve them.</note> wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'>The <note>The order of nature will seem to be changed because of the horrible afflictions that will be in the world; (Isa_13:10; Eze_32:7; Joe_3:15; Mat_24:29).</note> sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'>And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call <note>God's judgments are for the destruction of the unbelievers, and to exhort the godly to call upon the name of God, who will give them salvation.</note> on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the <note>Meaning the Gentiles by this; (Rom_10:13).</note> remnant whom the LORD shall call.</verse>
