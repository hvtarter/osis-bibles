        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of <note>Which was a town five miles from Jerusalem in Judea, but he prophesied in Israel.</note> Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of <note>In his days the kingdom of Israel flourished the most.</note> Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the <note>Which as Josephus writes, was when Uzziah would have usurped the priest's office, and therefore was smitten with leprosy.</note> earthquake. <note>The Argument - Among many other Prophets that God raised up to admonish the Israelites of his plagues for their wickedness and idolatry, he stirred up Amos, who was a herdman or shepherd of a poor town, and gave him both knowledge and constancy to reprove all estates and degrees, and to make known God's horrible judgments against them, unless they repented in time. And he showed them, that if God did not spare the other nations around them, who had lived as it were in ignorance of God compared to them, but for their sins punished them, then they could look for nothing, but a horrible destruction, unless they turned to the Lord in true repentance. And finally, he comforts the godly with hope of the coming of the Messiah, by whom they would have perfect deliverance and salvation.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top <note>Whatever is fruitful and pleasant in Israel, will shortly perish.</note> of Carmel shall wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus saith the LORD; For <note>He shows first that all the people round about would be destroyed for their manifold sins: which are meant by three and four, which make seven, so that the Israelites would the more deeply consider God's judgments toward them.</note> three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have <note>If the Syrians will not be spared for committing this cruelty against one city, it is not possible that Israel would escape punishment, which has committed so many and such grievous sins against God and man.</note> threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto <note>Tiglath Pileser led the Assyrians captive, and brought them to Cyrene, which he here calls Kir.</note> Kir, saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they <note>They united themselves with the Edomites their enemies, who carried them away captive.</note> carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver [them] up to Edom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>Therefore will I sende a fire vpon the walles of Azzah, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the <note>For Esau (from whom came the Edomites) and Jacob were brothers, therefore they ought to have admonished them by their brotherly friendship, and not to have provoked them to hatred.</note> brotherly covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>Therefore wil I send a fire vpon ye walles of Tyrus, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath <note>He was a continual enemy to him.</note> for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>Therefore will I send a fire vpon Teman, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they <note>He notes the great cruelty of the Ammonites, that did not spare the women, but most tyrannously tormented them, and yet the Ammonites came from Lot, who was of the household of Abraham.</note> have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>Therefore will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battell, and with a tempest in the day of the whirlewinde.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because he burned the <note>For the Moabites were so cruel against the King of Edom, that they burnt his bones after he was dead: which declared their barbarous rage, that they would avenge themselves upon the dead.</note> bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>Therefore will I send a fire vpon Moab, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Kerioth, and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>And I will cut off the iudge out of the mids thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, sayth the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, <note>Seeing that the Gentiles who did have as much knowledge were punished in this way, Judah which was so fully instructed by the Lord's will, should not think that they would escape.</note> I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>Therefore will I send a fire vpon Iudah, and it shall deuoure the palaces of Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of <note>If he did not spare Judah unto whom his promises were made, much more he will not spare this degenerate kingdom.</note> Israel, and for four, I will not turn away [the punishment] thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of <note>They esteemed most vile bribes more than men's lives.</note> shoes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>That pant after the <note>When they have robbed him and thrown him to the ground, they open wide their mouths for his life.</note> dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the [same] maid, to profane my holy name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>And they lay [themselves] down upon clothes laid to pledge <note>Thinking that by these ceremonies, that is, by sacrificing, and by being near my altar, they may excuse all of their other wickedness.</note> by every altar, and they <note>They rob others and offer it to God, thinking that he will exempt them, when he is made partaker of their iniquity.</note> drink the wine of the condemned [in] the house of their god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet destroyed I the <note>The destruction of their enemies and his mercy toward them, should have caused their hearts to melt because of love toward him.</note> Amorite before them, whose height [was] like the height of the cedars, and he [was] strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you vp from the land of Egypt, and led you fourtie yeres thorowe the wildernesse, to possesse the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of <note>You condemned my benefits, and abused my graces, and craftily went about to stop the mouths of my Prophets.</note> your young men for Nazarites. [Is it] not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But ye gaue the Nazarites wine to drinke, and commanded the Prophetes, saying, Prophecie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I am <note>You have wearied me with your sins; (Isa_1:14).</note> pressed under you, as a cart is pressed [that is] full of sheaves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>
          <note>Can anything come without God's providence?</note>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin [is] for him? shall [one] take up a <note>Will his threatenings be in vain?</note> snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>
          <note>Will the Prophet's threaten God's judgments and the people not be afraid?</note>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there <note>Does any adversity come without God's appointment?

        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he <note>God does not deal with the Israelites as he does with other people: for he always warns them before of his plagues by his Prophets.</note> revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>
          <note>That is, when Amos had prophesied that the king would be destroyed: for the wicked priest more for hatred he had for the Prophet than for love toward the king, thought this accusation sufficient to condemn him. However, only what the Prophet said could take place.</note>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos saith, Ieroboam shal die by the sworde, and Israel shalbe led away captiue out of their owne land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also <note>When this instrument of Satan was not able to accomplish his purpose by the king, he tried by another practice, that was, to scare the Prophet, that he might depart, and not reprove their idolatry there openly, and so hinder his profit.</note> Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>But prophecie no more at Beth-el: for it is the Kings chappel, and it is the Kings court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no <note>Thus he shows by his extraordinary calling, that God had given him a charge, which he must necessarily execute.</note> prophet, neither [was] I a prophet's son; but I [was] an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>Therefore thus saith the LORD; <note>In this way God used to approve the authority of his Prophets, by his plagues and judgments against those who were malicious enemies as in (Jer_28:12-17; Jer_29:21-26), as this day he does against those that persecute the ministers of his Gospel.</note> Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</verse>
