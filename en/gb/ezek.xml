      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the <note>After that the book of the Law as found, which was the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, so that twenty-five years after this book was found, Jeconiah was led away captive with Ezekiel and many of the people, who the first year later saw these visions.</note> thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of <note>Which was a part of Euphrates so called.</note> Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of <note>That is, notable and excellent visions, so that it might be known, it was no natural dream but came from God.</note> God. <note>The Argument - After Jehoiachin by the counsel of Jeremiah and Ezekiel had yielded himself to Nebuchadnezzar, and so went into captivity with his mother and various of his princes and of the people, some began to repent and murmur that they had obeyed the prophet's counsel, as though the things which they had prophesied would not come to pass, and therefore their estate would still be miserable under the Chaldeans. By reason of which he confirms his former prophecies, declaring by new visions and revelations shown to him, that the city would most certainly be destroyed, and the people grievously tormented by God's plagues, in so much that they who remained would be brought into cruel bondage. Lest the godly despair in these great troubles, he assures them that God will deliver his church at his appointed time and also destroy their enemies, who either afflicted them, or rejoiced in their miseries. The effect of the one and the other would be chiefly performed under Christ, of whom in this book are many notable promises, and in whom the glory of the new temple would perfectly be restored. He prophesied these things in Chaldea, at the same time that Jeremiah prophesied in Judah, and there began in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fift day of the moneth (which was the fift yere of King Ioiachins captiuitie)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the <note>That is, the spirit of prophecy, as in (Eze_3:22, Eze_37:1).</note> hand of the LORD was there upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a <note>By this diversity of words he signifies the fearful judgment of God and the great afflictions that would come on Jerusalem.</note> whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness [was] about it, and from the midst of it as the colour of amber, from the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also from the midst of it [came] the likeness of <note>Which were the four Cherubims that represented the glory of God, as in (Eze_11:22).</note> four living beings. And this [was] their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And euery one had foure faces, and euery one had foure wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feete were streight feete, and the sole of their feete was like the sole of a calues foote, and they sparkled like the appearance of bright brasse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And the handes of a man came out from vnder their wings in the foure parts of them, &amp; they foure had their faces, and their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings [were] <note>The wing of the one touched the wing of the other.</note> joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had <note>Every cherubim had four faces, the face of a man, and of a lion on the right side, and the face of a bullock and of an eagle on the left side.</note> the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces: but their wings were spred out aboue: two wings of euery one were ioined one to another, &amp; two couered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And euery one went streight forward: they went whither their spirit led them, and they returned not when they went forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>The similitude also of the beasts, and their appearance was like burning coles of fire, &amp; like the appearance of lampes: for the fire ran among the beastes, and the fire gaue a glister, and out of the fire there went lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living beings ran and <note>That is, when they had executed God's will: for before they returned not till God had changed the state of things.</note> returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Nowe as I behelde the beastes, beholde, a wheele appeared vpon the earth by the beastes, hauing foure faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work [was] like the colour of a <note>The Hebrew word is tarshish meaning that the colour was like the Cilician Sea, or a precious stone so called.</note> beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work [was] as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>Whe they went, they went vpo their foure sides, and they returned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>They had also rings, and height, and were fearefull to beholde, and their rings were full of eyes, round about them foure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the beastes went, the wheeles went with them: and when the beasts were lift vp from the earth, the wheeles were lift vp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Whither the spirit led them, they went, &amp; thither did the spirite of the wheeles leade them, and the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirit of the beastes was in the wheeles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When the beastes went, they went, &amp; when they stoode, they stoode, and when they were lifted vp from the earth, the wheeles were lifted vp besides them: for the spirite of the beastes was in the wheeles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And the similitude of the firmament vpon the heads of the beasts was wonderfull, like vnto chrystall, spred ouer their heads aboue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And vnder the firmament were their wings streight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which couered the, and euery one had two, which couered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their <note>Which declared the swiftness and the fearfulness of God's judgments.</note> wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they <note>Which signified that they had no power of themselves, but only waited to execute God's commandment.</note> let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voyce fro the firmament, that was ouer their heads, when they stoode, and had let downe their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And aboue the firmament that was ouer their heads, was the facion of a throne like vnto a saphir stone, and vpon the similitude of the throne was by appearance, as the similitude of a man aboue vpon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire <note>By which was signified a terrible judgment toward the earth.</note> around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so [was] the appearance of the brightness around. This [was] the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw [it], I fell <note>Considering the majesty of God, and the weakness of flesh.</note> upon my face, and I heard a voice of one speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And <note>That is, the Lord.</note> he said to me, <note>Meaning, man who is but earth and ashes, which was to humble him, and cause him to consider his own state, and God's grace.</note> Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>
          <note>So that he could not abide God's presence, till God's Spirit entered into him.</note>And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: for they and their fathers haue rebelled against me, euen vnto this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>For they are impudent children, and stiffe hearted: I do send thee vnto them, &amp; thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they [are] a rebellious house,) yet shall know that <note>This declares on the one part God's great affection toward his people, that despite their rebellion, yet he will send his prophets among them, and admonishes his ministers on the other part that they cease not to do their duty, though the people are never so obstinate: for the word of God will be either to their salvation or greater condemnation.</note> there hath been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, <note>Read (Jer_1:17). He shows that for no afflictions they would cease to do their duties.</note> be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns [are] with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>Therefore thou shalt speake my words vnto them: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease: for they are rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and <note>He not only exhorts him to his duty but also gives him the means with which he may be able to execute it.</note> eat that which I give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked vp, beholde, an hande was sent vnto me, and loe, a roule of a booke was therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me; and it [was] written within and without: and [there was] written in it <note>He shows what were the contents of this book: that is, God's judgments against the wicked.</note> lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; <note>By which is meant that no one is fit to be God's messenger before he has received the word of God in his heart, as in (Eze_3:10) and has a zeal to it, and delight in it, as in (Jer_15:16; Rev_10:10).</note> eat this scroll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he gaue mee this roule to eate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate it, and it was in my mouth as sweete as honie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, and enter into the house of Israel, and declare them my wordes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou art not sent to a people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an hard language, but to the house of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>Not to many people of an vnknowen tongue, or of an harde language, whose wordes thou canst not vnderstand: yet if I should sende thee to them, they would obey thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not obey thee: for they will not obey me: yea, all the house of Israel are impudent and stiffe hearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy <note>God promises his assistance to his ministers, and that he will give them boldness and constancy in their calling, (Isa_50:7; Jer_1:18; Mic_3:8).</note> face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>I haue made thy forehead as the adamant, and harder then the flint: feare them not therefore, neither be afraid at their lookes: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee <note>He shows what is meant by the eating of the book, which is that the ministers of God may speak nothing from themselves, but only that which they have received from the Lord.</note> receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And goe and enter to them that are led away captiues vnto the children of thy people, and speake vnto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord God: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], <note>By which he signifies that God's glory would not be diminished, although he departed out of his temple, for this declared that the city and temple would be destroyed.</note> Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard also the noyse of the wings of the beasts, that touched one another, and the ratling of the wheeles that were by them, euen a noyse of a great russhing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I <note>This shows that there is always an infirmity of the flesh which can never be ready to render full obedience to God, and also God's grace who ever assists his, and overcomes their rebellious affections.</note> went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at <note>Which was a place by Euphrates where the Jews were prisoners.</note> Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them <note>Declaring here that God's ministers must with advisement and deliberation utter his judgments.</note> seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And at the ende of seuen dayes, the worde of the Lorde came againe vnto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made thee a <note>Of this read (Eze_33:2).</note> watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I shall say vnto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest not him warning, nor speakest to admonish the wicked of his wicked way, that he may liue, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hande.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquitie, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When a <note>If he that has been instructed in the right way turn back.</note> righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a <note>I will give him up to a reprobate mind, (Rom_1:28).</note> stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his <note>Which seemed to have been done in faith, and was not.</note> righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Neuerthelesse, if thou admonish that righteous man, that the righteous sinne not, and that he doeth not sinne, he shall liue because he is admonished: also thou hast deliuered thy soule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the <note>That is, the Spirit of prophecy.</note> hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the <note>Meaning, the vision of the cherubims and the wheels.</note> glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the spirit entered into me, and <note>Read (Jer_2:2).</note> set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, <note>Signifying that not only would he not profit, but they would grievously trouble and afflict him.</note> shut thyself within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But thou, O sonne of man, beholde, they shall put bandes vpon thee, and shall binde thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make thy tongue <note>Which declares the terrible plague of the Lord, when God stops the mouths of his ministers and that all such are the rods of his vengeance that do it.</note> cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they [are] a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I shall haue spoken vnto thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that leaueth off, let him leaue: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.1'>The worde of the Lord came vnto me againe, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.2'>What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, <note>The people murmured at the chastising of the Lord, and therefore used this proverb meaning that their fathers had sinned and their children were punished for their transgressions. {{See Jer_31:29}}</note> The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.3'>As I liue, sayth the Lord God, ye shall vse this prouerbe no more in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.4'>Beholde, all soules are mine, both the soule of the father, and also the soule of the sonne are mine: the soule that sinneth, it shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.5'>But if a man be iust, and doe that which is lawfull, and right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>[And] hath not eaten <note>If he has not eaten flesh that has been offered up to idols, to honour them by it.</note> upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a polluted woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>Neither hath oppressed any, but hath restored the pledge to his dettour: he that hath spoyled none by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.8'>And hath not giuen foorth vpon vsurie, neither hath taken any increase, but hath withdrawen his hand from iniquitie, and hath executed true iudgement betweene man and man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.9'>And hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my iudgements to deale truely, he is iust, he shall surely liue, sayth the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.10'>If he beget a sonne, that is a thiefe, or a sheader of blood, if he do any one of these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.11'>Though he doe not all these things, but either hath eaten vpon the mountaines, or defiled his neighbours wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.12'>Or hath oppressed the poore and needy, or hath spoyled by violence, or hath not restored the pledge, or hath lift vp his eyes vnto the idoles, or hath committed abomination,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.13'>Hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; <note>He shows how the son is punished for his father's sin: that is, if he is wicked as his father was and does not repent, he will be punished as his father was, or else not.</note> he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.14'>But if he beget a sonne, that seeth all his fathers sinnes, which he hath done, and feareth, neither doeth such like,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.15'>That hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, neither hath lift vp his eyes to the idols of ye house of Israel, nor hath defiled his neighbours wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.16'>Neither hath oppressed any, nor hath withholden the pledge, neither hath spoyled by violence, but hath giuen his bread to the hungry, and hath couered the naked with a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.17'>Neither hath withdrawen his hand from the afflicted, nor receiued vsurie nor increase, but hath executed my iudgements, and hath walked in my statutes, he shall not die in the iniquitie of his father, but he shal surely liue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.18'>His father, because he cruelly oppressed and spoyled his brother by violence, and hath not done good among his people, loe, euen he dyeth in his iniquitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.19'>Yet say ye, Wherefore shall not the sonne beare the iniquitie of the father? because ye sonne hath executed iudgement &amp; iustice, and hath kept all my statutes, and done them, he shal surely liue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The same soule that sinneth, shal die: the sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne, but the righteousnes of the righteous shall be vpon him, and the wickednesse of the wicked shall be vpon him selfe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.21'>But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my <note>He joins the observation of the commandments with repentance; for none can repent indeed, unless he labour to keep the Law.</note> statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.22'>All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned to him: in his <note>That is, in the fruit of his faith which declares that God accepts him.</note> righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.23'>
          <note>He speaks this to commend God's mercy to poor sinners, who rather is ready to pardon than to punish, as his long suffering declares, (Eze_33:11). Though God in his eternal counsel appointed the death and damnation of the reprobate, yet the end of his counsel was not their death only, but chiefly his own glory. Also because he does not approve sin, therefore it is here said that he would have them turn away from it that they might live.</note>Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.24'>But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his <note>That is, the false opinion that the hypocrites have of their righteousness.</note> righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.25'>Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not <note>In punishing the father with the children.</note> equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.26'>For when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousnes, and committeth iniquitie, he shall euen die for the same, he shal euen die for his iniquitie, that he hath done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.27'>Againe when the wicked turneth away from his wickednes that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawfull and right, he shal saue his soule aliue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.28'>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that hee hath committed, he shall surely liue and shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.29'>Yet saith ye house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equall. O house of Israel, are not my wayes equall? or are not your wayes vnequall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.30'>Therefore I will iudge you, O house of Israel, euery one according to his wayes, sayth the Lord God: returne therefore and cause others to turne away from all your transgressions: so iniquitie shall not be your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.31'>Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make <note>He shows that man cannot forsake his wickedness, till his heart is changed which is only the work of God.</note> you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.32'>For I desire not the death of him that dyeth, sayth the Lord God: cause therefore one another to returne, and liue ye.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.1'>Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the <note>That is, Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim, Josiah's sons, who for their pride and cruelty are compared to lions.</note> princes of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.2'>And say, What [is] thy <note>That is Jehoahaz's mother, or Jerusalem.</note> mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.3'>And she brought vp one of her whelps, and it became a lyon, and it learned to catch the praye, and it deuoured men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.5'>Now when she saw that she had waited, [and] her hope was lost, then she took another of her <note>Which was Jehoiakim.</note> whelps, [and] made him a young lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.6'>And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, [and] devoured <note>He slew the prophets and them that feared God and ravished their wives.</note> men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.8'>Then the <note>Nebuchadnezzar with his great army which was gathered from various nations.</note> nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.9'>And they put him in prison and in chaines, and brought him to the King of Babel, and they put him in holdes, that his voyce should no more be heard vpon the mountaines of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.11'>And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that beare rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.1'>And it came to pass in the <note>Of the captivity of Jeconiah.</note> seventh year, in the fifth [month], the tenth [day] of the month, [that] certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.2'>Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.3'>Sonne of man, speake vnto the Elders of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye come to enquire of me? As I liue, sayth the Lord God, when I am asked, I wil not answer you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.4'>Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge [them]? cause <note>This declares the great leniency and patience of God who calls sinners to repentance before he condemns them.</note> them to know the abominations of their fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.5'>And say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and <note>I swore that I would be their God, which manner of oath was observed from all antiquity, where they used to lift up their hands toward the heavens, acknowledging God to be the author of truth and the defender of it, and also the judge of the heart, wishing that he would take vengeance, if they concealed anything which they knew to be truth.</note> lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I [am] the LORD your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.6'>In the day that I lift vp mine hand vnto them to bring them forth of the land of Egypt, into a land that I had prouided for them, flowing with milke &amp; hony which is pleasant among all lands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.7'>Then said I to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, <note>God had forbidden them to make mention of the idols, (Exo_23:13; Psa_16:4).</note> and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.8'>But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of <note>Which declares the wickedness of man's heart, who judge God's service by their eyes and outward senses.</note> their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.9'>But I wrought for my <note>God had ever this respect to his glory, that he would not have evil spoken of his Name among the Gentiles for the punishment that his people deserved, in confidence of which the godly ever prayed, as in (Exo_32:12; Num_14:13).</note> name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the nations, among whom they [were], in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.10'>Nowe I caried them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wildernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.11'>And I gaue them my statutes, and declared my iudgements vnto them, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.12'>Moreouer I gaue them also my Sabbaths to be a signe betwene me &amp; them, that they might knowe that I am the Lord, that sanctifie them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.13'>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wildernes: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my iudgements, which if a man doe, he shall liue in them, and my Sabbaths haue they greatly polluted: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpon them in the wildernes to consume them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.14'>But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be profaned before the <note>Who might by it take an opportunity to blaspheme my Name and to accuse me of lack of ability, or else that I had sought a means to destroy them more conveniently.</note> nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.15'>Yet neuerthelesse, I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes that I would not bring them into the lande, which I had giuen them, flowing with milke and hony, which was pleasant aboue all landes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.16'>Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but profaned my <note>That is, my true religion, which I had commanded them, and gave themselves to serve me according to their own fantasies.</note> sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.17'>Neuerthelesse, mine eye spared them, that I would not destroye them, neither would I consume them in the wildernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.18'>But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your <note>By which the Holy Spirit confuses them that say that they will follow the religion and example of their fathers, and not measure their doings by God's word whether they are approved by it or not.</note> fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.19'>I am the Lord your God: walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements and doe them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.20'>And sanctifie my Sabbaths, and they shall bee a signe betweene mee and you, that ye may knowe that I am the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.21'>Notwithstanding the children rebelled against mee: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my iudgements to doe them, which if a man doe, hee shall liue in them, but they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to powre out mine indignation vpo them, and to accomplish my wrath against them in the wildernes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.22'>Neuerthelesse I withdrew mine hand &amp; had respect to my Name that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them foorth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.23'>Yet I lift vp mine hande vnto them in the wildernes, that I would scatter them among the heathen, &amp; disperse them through the countreys,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.24'>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after <note>Meaning that they set their delight on them.</note> their fathers' idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.25'>Wherefore I gave <note>Because they would not obey my laws, I gave them up to themselves that they should obey their own fantasies, as in (Eze_20:39; Rom_1:21, Rom_1:24).</note> them also statutes [that were] not good, and judgments by which they should not live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.26'>And I polluted them in their own <note>I condemned those things, and counted them as abominable, which they thought had been excellent and to have declared most zeal, (Luk_16:15) for that which God required as most excellent they gave to their idols.</note> gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all the firstborn, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.27'>Therefore, sonne of man, speake vnto the house of Israel, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God, Yet in this your fathers haue blasphemed me, though they had before grieuously transgressed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.28'>
          <note>Not only in the wilderness, when I brought them out of Egypt, but since I placed them in this land: which declares how prompt man's heart is to idolatry seeing that by no admonitions can he be drawn back.</note>[For] when I had brought them into the land, [for] which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.29'>Then I said to them, What [is] the high place to which ye go? And its name is called <note>Which signifies a high place, declaring that they vaunted themselves of their idolatry and were not ashamed of it, though God had commanded them expressly that they should have no altar lifted on high by stairs, (Exo_20:26).</note> Bamah to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.30'>Wherefore, say vnto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye not polluted after the maner of your fathers? and commit ye not whoredome after their abominations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.31'>For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, <note>He shows that the ingratitude of the people deserves that God should cut them off, and that they should not have the comfort of his word.</note> I will not be enquired of by you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.39'>As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; <note>This is spoken to the hypocrites.</note> Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and after this [also], if ye will not hearken to me: but profane ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.40'>For in mine holy mountaine, euen in the hie mountaine of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, and all in the lande, serue me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offrings and the first fruites of your oblations, with all your holy things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.41'>I will accept your sweete sauour, when I bring you from the people, and gather you out of the countreys, wherein ye haue bene scattered, that I may be sanctified in you before ye heathen.</verse>
