  <div type='book' osisID='1Sam'>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of <note>There were two Ramatus, so that in this city in mount Ephraim were Zophim, that is, the learned men and prophets.</note> Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name [was] Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: <note>The Argument - As God had ordained in (Deu_17:14), that when the Israelites entered the land of Canaan, he would appoint a king for them: so here in the first book of Samuel the state of the people under their first king Saul is declared. Not content with the order that God had temporarily appointed for the government of his Church, they demanded a king, so that they might be as other nations. As well they thought they would be better off, not because they could serve God better by it, but because they would be under the safeguard of him who represented Jesus Christ the true deliverer. Therefore God gave them a tyrant and a hypocrite to rule over them, so that they might learn that a king is not sufficient to defend them, unless God by his power preserves and keeps them. Therefore he punishes the ingratitude of his people, and sends them continual wars both at home and abroad. Also, because Saul, whom God had given to the honour of a king out of nothing, did not acknowledge God's mercy to him, but rather disobeyed the word of God and was not zealous of his glory, he was removed from his estate by God, and David the true figure of Messiah was placed in his stead. His patience, modesty, constancy, persecution by open enemies, feigned friends, and deceitful flatterers, is left to the Church and to every member of it, as a pattern and example of their state and calling.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wiues: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in <note>For the ark was there at that time.</note> Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, [were] there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And on a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, he gaue to Peninnah his wife and to all her sonnes and daughters portions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy <note>Some read, a portion with a hearty cheer.</note> portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her aduersarie vexed her sore, forasmuch as she vpbraided her, because the Lorde had made her barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>(And so did he yeere by yeere) and as oft as she went vp to the house of the Lord, thus she vexed her, that she wept and did not eate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? [am] not I better to thee than ten <note>Let this comfort you, that I love you no less than if you had many children.</note> sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the <note>That is of the house where the ark was.</note> temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was troubled in her minde, and prayed vnto the Lord, and wept sore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>Also she vowed a vowe, and sayd, O Lord of hostes, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thine handmaide, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaide, but giue vnto thine handmaide a manchilde, then I will giue him vnto the Lord all the dayes of his life, and there shall no rasor come vpon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli marked her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>For Hannah spake in her heart: her lips did moue onely, but her voyce was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had bene drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli sayde vnto her, Howe long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy drunkennesse from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>Then Hannah answered and sayd, Nay my lord, but I am a woman troubled in spirit: I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke, but haue powred out my soule before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not thine handmaide for a wicked woman: for of the abundance of my complaint and my griefe haue I spoken hitherto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered, and sayd, Go in peace, and the God of Israel graunt thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thine handmaid find <note>That is, pray to the Lord for me.</note> grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [sad].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD <note>According to her petition.</note> remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>For in processe of time Hannah conceiued, and bare a sonne, and she called his name Samuel, Because, said she, I haue asked him of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man <note>This Elkanah was a Levite, (1Ch_6:27), and as some write once a year they were accustomed to appear before the Lord with their families.</note> Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah went not vp: for she sayd vnto her husband, I will tarie vntill the childe be weined, then I will bring him that hee may appeare before the Lord, and there abide for euer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his <note>Because her prayer took effect, therefore it was called the Lord's promise.</note> word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weined him, she tooke him with her with three bullockes and an Ephah of floure and a bottell of wine, and brought him vnto the house of the Lorde in Shiloh, and the childe was yong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slewe a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy <note>That is, most certainly.</note> soul liveth, my lord, I [am] the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>I prayed for this childe, and the Lord hath giuen me my desire which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he <note>Meaning, Eli gave thanks to God for her.</note> worshipped the LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah <note>After she had obtained a son by prayer she gave thanks.</note> prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine <note>I have recovered strength and glory by the benefit of the Lord.</note> horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is <note>I can answer them that criticize my barrenness.</note> enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as the Lord: yea, there is none besides thee, &amp; there is no god like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk <note>In that you condemn my barrenness, you show your pride against God.</note> no more so exceeding proudly; let [not] arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD [is] a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bow and the mightie men are broken, and the weake haue girded themselues with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>[They that were] full have hired out themselves for <note>They sell their labours for necessary food.</note> bread; and [they that were] hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The Lord killeth and maketh aliue: bringeth downe to the graue and raiseth vp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The Lord maketh poore and maketh rich: bringeth lowe, and exalteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, [and] lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set [them] among <note>He prefers to honour, and does according to his own will, though man's judgment is contrary.</note> princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth [are] the <note>Therefore he may dispose all things according to his will.</note> LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>Hee will keepe the feete of his Saintes, and the wicked shall keepe silence in darkenes: for in his owne might shall no man be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his <note>She grounded her prayer on Jesus Christ who was to come.</note> king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the <note>In all that Eli commanded him.</note> LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli [were] sons of Belial; they <note>That is, they neglected his ordinance.</note> knew not the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>For the Priestes custome towarde the people was this: when any man offered sacrifice, the Priestes boy came, while the flesh was seething, and a fleshhooke with three teeth, in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck [it] into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; <note>Transgressing the order appointed in the Law, (Lev_7:31), for their bellies sake.</note> all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also before they burnt the <note>Which was commanded first to have been offered to God.</note> fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And [if] any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and [then] take [as much] as thy soul <note>Not passing for their own profit, so that God might be served rightly.</note> desireth; then he would answer him, [Nay]; but thou shalt give [it me] now: and if not, I will take [it] by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men <note>Seeing the horrible abuse of it.</note> abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>Now Samuel being a yong childe ministred before the Lord, girded with a linen Ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother made him a litle coat, and brought it to him from yeere to yeere, when she came vp with her husband, to offer the yerely sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord giue thee seede of this woman, for the petition that she asked of the Lord: and they departed vnto their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the Lorde visited Hannah, so that she conceiued, &amp; bare three sonnes, &amp; two daughters; the childe Samuel grewe before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that <note>Which was (as the Hebrews write) after their travail, when they came to be purified, read (Exo_38:8; Lev_12:6).</note> assembled [at] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And hee saide vnto them, Why doe ye such things? For of all this people I heare euill reportes of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Nay, my sons; for [it is] no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to <note>Because they contemn their duty to God, (1Sa_2:17).</note> transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD <note>So that to obey good admonition is God's mercy, and to disobey them is his just judgment for sin.</note> would slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>(Nowe the childe Samuel profited and grewe, and was in fauour both with the Lord and also with men)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy <note>That is, Aaron.</note> father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my Priest, to offer vpon mine altar, and to burne incense, and to weare an Ephod before me, and I gaue vnto the house of thy father all the offrings made by fire of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore <note>Why have you contemned my sacrifices, and as it were trod them under foot?</note> kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded [in my] habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed [that] thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, <note>God's promises are only effective to those he gives faith to fear and obey him.</note> Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine <note>Thy power and authority.</note> arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou <note>Your posterity will see the glory of the chief priest given to another, whom they will envy, (1Ki_2:27).</note> shalt see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all [the wealth] which [God] shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>Neuerthelesse, I will not destroy euery one of thine fro mine altar, to make thine eyes to faile, and to make thine heart sorowfull: and all ye multitude of thine house shall die when they be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shalbe a signe vnto thee, that shal come vpon thy two sonnes Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a <note>Meaning Zadok, who succeeded Abiathar, and was the figure of Christ.</note> faithful priest, [that] shall do according to [that] which [is] in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, [that] every one that is left in thine house shall come [and] <note>That is, will be inferior to him.</note> crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD <note>The Chaldee text reads «while Eli lived».</note> before Eli. And the word of the LORD was <note>Because there were very few prophets to declare it.</note> precious in those days; [there was] no open vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli [was] laid down in his <note>In the court next to the tabernacle.</note> place, and his eyes began to wax dim, [that] he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And ere the <note>That is, the lamps which burnt in the night.</note> lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God [was], and Samuel was laid down [to sleep];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>That the LORD <note>Josephus writes that Samuel was 12 years old when the Lord appeared to him.</note> called Samuel: and he answered, Here [am] I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ranne vnto Eli, and said, Here am I, for thou calledst me. But he said, I called thee not: goe againe and sleepe; he went and slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the Lorde called once againe, Samuel; Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, I am here: for thou diddest call me; he answered, I called thee not, my sonne: go againe and sleepe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know <note>By vision.</note> the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here [am] I; for thou didst call me. And Eli <note>Such was the corruption of those times that the chief priest had become dull and negligent to understand the Lord's appearing.</note> perceived that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli saide vnto Samuel, Goe and sleepe: and if he call thee, then say, Speake Lorde, for thy seruant heareth. So Samuel went, and slept in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the Lord came, and stoode, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speake, for thy seruant heareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall <note>God declares that sudden fear will come on men when they hear that the ark is taken, and see Eli's house destroyed.</note> tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will raise vp against Eli all things which I haue spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an ende.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>And I haue tolde him that I will iudge his house for euer, for the iniquitie which hee knoweth, because his sonnes ranne into a slaunder, and he stayed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for <note>Meaning that his posterity would never enjoy the chief priests office.</note> ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>Afterward Samuel slept vntil the morning, and opened the doores of the house of the Lord, and Samuel feared to shewe Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne; he answered, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What [is] the thing that [the LORD] hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide [it] not from me: God <note>God punish you after this and that sort, unless you tell me the truth, (Rth_1:17).</note> do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide [any] thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>So Samuel tolde him euery whit, and hid nothing from him. Then hee said, It is the Lorde: let him do what seemeth him good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words <note>The Lord accomplished whatever he had said.</note> fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel fro Dan to Beer-sheba knew that faithfull Samuel was the Lordes Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the Lorde appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lorde reueiled himselfe to Samuel in Shiloh by his word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And Samuel spake vnto all Israel: and Israel went out against the Philistims to battel and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistims pitched in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistims put themselues in aray against Israel: and when they ioyned the battell, Israel was smitten downe before the Philistims: who slewe of the armie in the fielde about foure thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, <note>For it seems that this war was undertaken by Samuel's commandment.</note> Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
