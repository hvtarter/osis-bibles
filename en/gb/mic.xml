      <chapter osisID='Mic.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.1'>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the <note>Born in Mareshah, a city of Judah.</note> Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, [and] Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. <note>The Argument - Micah the prophet of the tribe of Judah served in the work of the Lord concerning Judah and Israel at least thirty years: during which time Isaiah prophesied. He declares the destruction first of the one kingdom, and then of the other, because of their manifold wickedness, but chiefly because of their idolatry. And to this end he notes the wickedness of the people, the cruelty of the princes and governors, and the allowing of the false prophets, and the delighting in them. Then he sets forth the coming of Christ, his kingdom, and the felicity of it. This Prophet was not that Micah who resisted Ahab and all his false prophets, (1Ki_22:8) but another with the same name.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.2'>Hear, <note>Because of the malice and obstinacy of the people, whom he had so often exhorted to repentance, he summons them to God's judgments, taking all creatures, and God himself as witness, that the preaching of the Prophets, which they have abused, will be avenged.</note> all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.3'>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come <note>Meaning by this that God will come to judgment against the strong cities and strongholds.</note> down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.4'>And the mountaines shall melt vnder him (so shall the valleys cleaue) as waxe before the fire, and as the waters that are powred downewarde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.5'>For the transgression of Jacob [is] all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What [is] the transgression of Jacob? [is it] not <note>Samaria, which should have been an example to all Israel of true religion and justice, was the dirty pool and the tank that all idolatry and corruption was kept alive in, and who prided themselves in their father Jacob, and boasted of him.</note> Samaria? and what [are] the high <note>That is, the idolatry and infection.</note> places of Judah? [are they] not Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.6'>Therefore I wil make Samaria as an heape of the fielde, and for the planting of a vineyard, and I will cause the stones thereof to tumble downe into the valley, and I will discouer the foundations thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.7'>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the <note>Which they gathered by evil practices, and thought that their idols had enriched them with these wages because of their service to them.</note> hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered [it] of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return <note>The gain that came by their idols will be consumed as a thing of nothing: for as the wages or riches of harlots are wickedly gotten, so are they vilely and quickly spent.</note> to the hire of an harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.8'>Therefore I will mourne and howle: I wil goe without clothes, and naked: I will make lamentation like the dragons, and mourning as the ostriches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.9'>For her plagues are grieuous: for it is come into Iudah: the enemie is come vnto the gate of my people, vnto Ierusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.10'>Declare ye [it] not at <note>Lest the Philistines our enemies rejoice at our destruction.</note> Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of <note>Which was a city near to Jerusalem (Jos_18:23), there called Ophrah, and signifies dust: therefore he wants them to mourn and roll themselves in the dust, for their dusty city.</note> Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.11'>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of <note>These were cities by which the enemy would pass as he came to Judah.</note> Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall <note>He will not depart before he has overcome you, and so you will pay for his staying.</note> receive of you his standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.12'>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the <note>For Rabshakeh had shut up Jerusalem, so that they could not send to help them.</note> gate of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.13'>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the <note>To flee away: for Sennacherib laid siege first to that city, and remained there when he sent his captains and army against Jerusalem.</note> swift beast: she <note>You first received the idolatry of Jeroboam, and so infected Jerusalem.</note> [is] the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.14'>Therefore shalt thou give presents to <note>You will bribe the Philistines your neighbours, but they will deceive you, as well as those of Jerusalem.</note> Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib [shall be] a lie to the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.15'>Yet will I bring an <note>He prophesies against his own city: and because it signified a heritage, he says that God would send an heir to possess it.</note> heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam <note>For so they thought themselves because of the strength of their cities.</note> the glory of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.1.16'>Make thee balde: and shaue thee for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldenesse as the eagle, for they are gone into captiuity from thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.1'>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! <note>As soon as they rise, they execute their wicked devices of the night, and according to their ability hurt others.</note> when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.2'>And they couet fields, and take them by violence, and houses, and take them away: so they oppresse a man and his house, euen man and his heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.3'>Therefore thus saieth the Lorde, Beholde, against this familie haue I deuised a plague, whereout yee shall not plucke your neckes, and ye shall not go so proudly, for this time is euill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.4'>In that day shall [one] take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, <note>Thus the Jews lament and say that there is no hope of restitution, seeing their possessions are divided among the enemies.</note> We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed [it] from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.5'>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in <note>You will have no more lands to divide as you had in times past, and as you used to measure them in the Jubilee.</note> the congregation of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.6'>
          <note>Thus the people warn the prophets that they speak to them no more, for they cannot endure their threatenings.</note>Prophesy ye not, [say they to them that] prophesy: <note>God says that they will not prophesy, nor receive any more of their rebukes or taunts.</note> they shall not prophesy to them, [that] they shall not take shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.7'>O [thou that art] named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <note>Are these your works according to his Law?</note> [are] these his doings? do not my words do good to him <note>Do not the godly find my words comfortable?</note> that walketh uprightly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.8'>Even <note>That is, in past times.</note> of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the <note>The poor can have no benefit from them, but they rob them, as though they were enemies.</note> robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.9'>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away <note>That is, their substance and living, which is God's blessing, and as it were part of his glory.</note> my glory for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.10'>Arise ye, and depart; for this [is] not [your] <note>Jerusalem will not be your safeguard, but rather the cause of your destruction.</note> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy [you], even with a sore destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.11'>If a man <note>That is, show himself to be a prophet.</note> walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, [saying], <note>He shows what prophets they delight in, that is, in flatterers, who tell them pleasant tales, and speak of their benefits.</note> I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.12'>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, <note>To destroy you.</note> all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.2.13'>The <note>The enemy will break their gates and walls, and lead them into Chaldea.</note> breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD <note>To drive them forward, and to help their enemies.</note> on the head of them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.1'>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; [Is it] not for you to know <note>That thing which is just and lawful, both to govern my people properly, and also to clear your own conscience.</note> judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.2'>Who hate the good, and love the evil; <note>The Prophet condemns the wicked governors not only of covetousness, theft, and murder, but compares them to wolves, lions, and most cruel beasts.</note> who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.3'>And they eate also the flesh of my people, &amp; flay off their skinne from them, &amp; they breake their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.4'>Then <note>That is, when I will punish their wickedness: for though I hear the godly before they cry (Isa_65:24), yet I will not hear these even though they cry; (Isa_1:15) (Eze_8:18; Jam_2:13; 1Pe_3:11-12).</note> shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.5'>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that <note>They devour all their substance, and then flatter them, promising that all will go well. But if someone does not feed them, then they invent all ways to do evil.</note> bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.6'>Therefore <note>As you have loved to walk in darkness, and to prophesy lies, so God will reward you with gross blindness and ignorance, so that when all others will see the bright beams of God's grace, you will as blind men grope as in the night.</note> night [shall be] unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.7'>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover <note>When God will reveal them to the world, they will be afraid to speak: for all will know that they were but false prophets, and did give a false notion of the word of God.</note> their lips; for [there is] no answer of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.8'>But truly I am full <note>The Prophet being assured of his vocation by the Spirit of God, sets himself alone against all the wicked, showing how God gave him gifts, ability and knowledge, to discern between good and evil, and also steadfastness and endurance to reprove the sins of the people, and not to flatter them.</note> of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.9'>Heare this, I pray you, ye heades of the house of Iaakob, and princes of the house of Israel: they abhorre iudgement, and peruert all equitie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.10'>They build up Zion with <note>They will say that they are the people of God, and abuse his name, as a pretence to disguise their hypocrisy.</note> blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.11'>The heads thereof iudge for rewardes, and the Priestes thereof teache for hyre, and the prophets thereof prophecie for money: yet wil they leane vpon the Lorde, and say, Is not the Lorde among vs? no euill can come vpon vs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.3.12'>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be <note>Read (Jer_26:18).</note> plowed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mic.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.1'>But in the <note>When Christ will come, and the temple will be destroyed.</note> last days it shall come to pass, [that] the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the <note>{{See Isa_2:2}}</note> hills; and people shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.2'>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will <note>He shows that there is no true Church, except where the people are taught by God's pure word.</note> teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.3'>And he shall judge among many people, and <note>By his corrections and threatenings he will bring the people into subjection who are in the utmost corners of the world.</note> rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into <note>They will abstain from all evil doing, and exercise themselves in godliness and in well doing to others.</note> pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they <note>Read (Isa_2:4)</note> learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.4'>But they shall sit euery man vnder his vine, and vnder his figge tree, and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lorde of hostes hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.5'>For all people will walk <note>He shows that the people of God ought to remain constant in their religion, even if all the world should give themselves to their superstition and idolatry.</note> every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.6'>At the same day, saith the Lorde, will I gather her that halteth, and I will gather her that is cast out, and her that I haue afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.7'>And I will make her that halted <note>I will cause that Israel, who is now as one lame and halting, and so almost destroyed, to live again, and grow into a great people.</note> a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.8'>And thou, O <note>Meaning Jerusalem, where the Lord's flock was gathered.</note> tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even <note>The flourishing state of the kingdom, as it was under David and Solomon, which thing was accomplished for the Church by the coming of Christ.</note> the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.9'>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? [is <note>In the meantime he shows that they would endure great troubles and temptations, when they saw themselves neither to have king nor counsel.</note> there] no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.10'>Sorow and mourne, O daughter Zion, like a woman in trauaile: for nowe shalt thou goe foorth of the citie, and dwel in the field, and shalt goe into Babel, but there shalt thou be deliuered: there the Lord shall redeeme thee from the hand of thine enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.11'>Nowe also many nations are gathered against thee, saying, Zion shalbe condemned and our eye shall looke vpon Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.12'>But they <note>He shows that the faithful ought not to measure God's judgments by the braggings and threatenings of the wicked, but by these are admonished to lift up their hearts to God to call for deliverance.</note> know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mic.4.13'>Arise and thresh, <note>God gives his Church this victory, as often as he overcomes their enemies: but the accomplishment of this will be at the last coming of Christ.</note> O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</verse>
