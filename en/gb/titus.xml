      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, <note>He vouches his apostleship (not for Titus, but for the Cretian's sake) both by the testimony of his outward calling, and by his consent in which he agrees with all the elect from the beginning of the world.</note> a <note>A minister, as Christ himself, in his office of minister and head of the Prophets, is called a servant; (Isa_43:10).</note> servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's <note>Of those whom God has chosen.</note> elect, <note>The faith in which all the elect agree, is the true and sincere knowledge of God for this purpose, that worshipping God correctly, they may at length obtain everlasting life according to the promise of God, who is true, which promise was exhibited in Christ in due time according to his eternal purpose.</note> and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>In <note>Hope is the end of faith.</note> hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, <note>Freely and only from his generosity.</note> promised before the <note>{{See 2Ti_1:9}}</note> world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>
          <note>This truth is not to be sought anywhere else, but in the preaching of the apostles.</note>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our <note>This word «Saviour» does not only signify a preserver of life, but also a giver of life.</note> Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>
          <note>The apostle exhorts the Cretians to hear Titus, by setting forth his consent and agreement with them in the faith, and in addition shows by what special note we may distinguish true ministers from false.</note>To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: <note>There is but one way of salvation, common both to the pastor and the flock.</note> Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>
          <note>The first admonition: to ordain elders in every church.</note>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or <note>This word is used of horses and oxen, who will not tolerate the yoke.</note> unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>
          <note>The second admonition: what faults pastors (whom he referred to before under the word elders) ought to be void of, and what virtues they ought to have.</note>For a bishop must be blameless, as the <note>Whom the Lord has appointed steward of his gifts.</note> steward of God; not <note>Not stubborn and hard to please.</note> selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, <note>Cautious, and of a sound judgment, and of a singular example of moderation.</note> sober, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>
          <note>The third admonition: the pastor must hold fast that doctrine which the apostles delivered, and pertains to salvation, leaving behind all curious and vain matters.</note>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, <note>The fourth admonition: to apply the knowledge of true doctrine to use, which consists in two things, that is, in governing those who show themselves able to learn, and confuting the obstinate.</note> that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>
          <note>An applying of the general proposition to a particular: the Cretians above all others need sharp reprehensions: both because their minds are naturally given to lies and slothfulness, and because of certain covetous Jews, who under a pretence of godliness, partly combined certain vain traditions, and partly old ceremonies with the Gospel.</note>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the <note>Of the Jews, or rather of those Jews who went about to join Christ and the Law.</note> circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>Whose mouthes must bee stopped, which subuert whole houses, teaching things, which they ought not, for filthie lucres sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>
          <note>Epimenides, who was considered a prophet amongst them. See Laertius, and Cicero in his first book of divination.</note>One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them <note>Clearly and plainly, and do not go about the bush with them.</note> sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>And not taking heede to Iewish fables and commaundements of men, that turne away from the trueth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>
          <note>He shows in few words, that purity consists not in any external worship, and that which is according to the old Law (as indifference of meats, and washings, and other such things which are abolished) but in the mind and conscience. And whoever teaches otherwise, does not know what true religion really is, and also is not to be heeded.</note>Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their <note>If our minds and consciences are unclean, what cleanness is there in us before regeneration?</note> mind and conscience is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They professe that they know God, but by works they deny him, and are abominable &amp; disobedient, and vnto euery good worke reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But <note>The fifth admonition: the doctrine must not only be generally pure, but also be applied to all ages and orders of men, according to the diversity of circumstances.</note> speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>
          <note>What are the principal virtues for old and young, both men and women: and how they ought to be stirred up to do them continually.</note>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>The elder women likewise, that they be in such behauiour as becommeth holinesse, not false accusers, not subiect to much wine, but teachers of honest things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>That they may instruct the yong women to be sober minded, that they loue their husbads, that they loue their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>[To be] discreet, chaste, <note>Not roving about idly.</note> keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Exhort yong men likewise, that they bee sober minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>
          <note>The sixth admonition: that both the pastor's life and doctrine must be sound.</note>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, <note>Not such a gravity as may drive men from coming to the minister, but such as may cause them to come in a most reverent and honest way.</note> gravity, sincerity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>And with the wholesome woorde, which can not be condemned, that hee which withstandeth, may be ashamed, hauing nothing concerning you to speake euill of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>
          <note>The seventh admonition, concerning the duty of servants to their masters.</note>[Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all <note>Which may be done without offence to God.</note> [things]; not answering again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>Neither pickers, but that they shew al good faithfulnesse, that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>
          <note>The eighth admonition belongs to all the godly: seeing that God calls all men to the Gospel, and Christ has so justified us, that he has also sanctified us, all of us must therefore give ourselves to true godliness, and righteousness, setting before us a sure hope of that immeasurable glory. And this thing must be so learned by them that the deniers also must be reproved, by the authority of the mighty God.</note>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and <note>Lusts of the flesh, which belong to the present state of this life and world.</note> worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>
          <note>Christ is here most plainly called that mighty God, and his appearance and coming is called by the figure of speech metonymy, our hope.</note>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a <note>As it were a thing peculiarly laid aside for himself.</note> peculiar people, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all <note>With all authority possible.</note> authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put <note>He declares particularly and separately that which he said before generally, noting out certain main and principal duties which men owe to men, and especially subjects to their magistrates.</note> them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>That they speake euill of no man, that they be no fighters, but soft, shewing all meekenesse vnto all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>
          <note>He confirms again the former exhortation by propounding the free benefit of our regeneration, the symbol of which is our baptism. (Ed.)</note>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when that bountifulnesse &amp; that loue of God our Sauiour toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by works of <note>Literally, «of works which are done in righteousness»: and this passage fully refutes the doctrine of meritorious works.</note> righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the <note>Which the power of the Holy Spirit works.</note> Holy Ghost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Which he shed on vs aboundantly, through Iesus Christ our Sauiour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>That we, being iustified by his grace, should be made heires according to the hope of eternall life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>
          <note>Again with great earnestness emphasises how we ought to give ourselves to true godliness and avoid all vain questions, which serve to nothing but to cause strife and debate.</note>[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain <note>Give themselves earnestly to good works.</note> good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But stay foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and brawlings about the Lawe: for they are vnprofitable and vaine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>
          <note>The ministers of the word must at once cast off heretics, that is, those who stubbornly and seditiously disquiet the Church, and will pay no attention to ecclesiastical admonitions.</note>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Knowing that hee that is such, is peruerted, and sinneth, being damned of his owne selfe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>
          <note>Last of all, he writes a word or two regarding personal matters, and commends certain men.</note>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Bring Zenas the expounder of the Lawe, and Apollos on their iourney diligently, that they lacke nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let ours also learne to shewe foorth good woorkes for necessary vses, that they be not vnfruitfull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with mee, salute thee. Greete them that loue vs in the faith. Grace bee with you all, Amen. To Titus, elect the first bishoppe of the Church of the Cretians, written from Nicopolis in Macedonia.</verse>
