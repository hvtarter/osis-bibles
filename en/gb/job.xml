      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of <note>That is, of the country of Idumea, (Lam_4:21), or bordering on it: for the land was called by the name of Uz, the son of Dishan, the son of Seir (Gen_36:28).</note> Uz, whose name [was] Job; and that man was perfect and <note>Since he was a Gentile and not a Jew and yet is pronounced upright and without hypocrisy, it declares that among the heathen God revealed himself.</note> upright, and <note>By this it is declared what is meant by an upright and just man.</note> one that feared God, and eschewed evil. <note>The Argument - In this history the example of patience is set before our eyes. This holy man Job was not only extremely afflicted in outward things and in his body, but also in his mind and conscience, by the sharp temptation of his wife and friends: who by their vehement words and subtle disputations brought him almost to despair. They set forth God as a sincere judge, and mortal enemy to him who had cast him off, therefore in vain he should seek him for help. These friends came to him under pretence of consolation, and yet they tormented him more than all his afflictions did. Even so, he constantly resisted them, and eventually succeeded. In this story we must note that Job maintains a good cause, but handles it badly. His adversaries have an evil matter, but they defend it craftily. Job held that God did not always punish men according to their sins, but that he had secret judgments, of which man knew not the cause, and therefore man could not reason against God in it, but he should be convicted. Moreover, he was assured that God had not rejected him, yet through his great torments and afflictions he speaks many inconveniences and shows himself as a desperate man in many things, and as one that would resist God, and this is his good cause which he handles well. Again the adversaries maintain with many good arguments that God punishes continually according to the trespass, grounding on God's providence, his justice and man's sins, yet their intention is evil; for they labour to bring Job into despair, and so they maintain an evil cause. Ezekiel commends Job as a just man, (Eze_14:14) and James sets out his patience for an example, (Jam_5:11).</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And he had seue sonnes, &amp; three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His <note>His children and riches are declared, to commend his virtue in his prosperity and his patience and constancy when God took them from him.</note> substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of <note>Meaning, the Arabians, Chaldeans, Idumeans etc.</note> the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sonnes went &amp; banketted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent, &amp; called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of [their] feasting were gone about, that Job sent and <note>That is, commanded them to be sanctified: meaning, that they should consider the faults that they had committed, and reconcile themselves for the same.</note> sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and <note>That is, he offered for each of his children an offering of reconciliation, which declared his religion toward God, and the care that he had for his children.</note> offered burnt offerings [according] to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and <note>In Hebrew it is, «blessed God», which is sometimes taken for blaspheming and cursing, as it is here and in (1Ki_21:10, 1Ki_21:13).</note> cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job <note>While the feast lasted.</note> continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the <note>Meaning the angels, who are called the sons of God because they are willing to execute his will.</note> sons of God came to present themselves <note>Because our infirmity cannot comprehend God in his majesty, he is set forth to us as a King, that our capacity may be able to understand that which is spoken of him.</note> before the LORD, and Satan <note>This declares that although Satan is an adversary to God, yet he is compelled to obey him, and do him all homage, without whose permission and appointment he can do nothing.</note> came also among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence <note>This question is asked for our infirmity: for God knew where he had come from.</note> comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, <note>In this is described the nature of Satan, which is always seeking his prey, (1Pe_5:8).</note> From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the Lord saide vnto Satan, Hast thou not considered my seruant Iob, how none is like him in the earth? an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for <note>He fears you not for your own sake, but for the blessing that he received from you.</note> nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not thou made <note>Meaning, the grace of God, which served Job as a rampart against all temptations.</note> an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thine hand now, and <note>This signifies that Satan is not able to touch us, but it is God that must do it.</note> touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to <note>Satan notes the vice to which men are commonly subjected, that is, to hide their rebellion and to be content with God in the time of prosperity which view is disclosed in the time of their adversity.</note> thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath [is] in <note>God does not give Satan power over man to gratify him, but to declare that he has no power over man, but that which God gives him.</note> thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the <note>That is, went to execute that which God had permitted him to do for else he can never go out of God's presence.</note> presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And on a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>There came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>And the <note>That is, the Arabians.</note> Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The <note>Which was also done by the craft of Satan, to tempt Job even more grievously, so he might see that not only men were his enemies, but that God made war against him.</note> fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>And whiles he was yet speaking, another came, and sayd, The Caldeans set on three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue taken them, and haue slayne the seruantes with the edge of the sworde: but I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he [was] yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy <note>This last plague declares that when one plague is past which seems hard to bear, God can send us another far more grievous, to try his and teach them obedience.</note> sons and thy daughters [were] eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>And behold, there came a great wind from beyonde the wildernesse, and smote the foure corners of the house, which fel vpon the children, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and <note>Which came not from impatience, but declares that the children of God are not insensible like blocks, but that in their patience they feel affliction and grief of mind: yet they do not rebel against God as the wicked do.</note> rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return <note>That is, into the belly of the earth, which is the mother of all.</note> thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; <note>By this he confesses that God is just and good, although his hand is sore on him.</note> blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God <note>But declared that God did all things according to justice and equity.</note> foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the <note>That is, the angels, (Job_1:6).</note> sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and <note>Read (Job_1:6).</note> Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>Then the Lord sayde vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lorde, and sayd, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that [there is] none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, <note>He proves Job's integrity by this that he ceased not to fear God when his plagues were grievously upon him.</note> although thou movedst me against <note>That is, when you had nothing against him, or when you were not able to bring your purpose to pass.</note> him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, <note>By this he means that a man's own skin is dearer to him than another man's.</note> Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his <note>Meaning, his own person.</note> bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he [is] in thine hand; but save <note>Thus Satan can go no further in punishing than God has limited him.</note> his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore <note>This sore was most vehement, with which God also plagued the Egyptians, (Exo_9:9) and threatened to punish rebellious people, (Deu_28:27) so that this temptation was most grievous: for if Job had measured God's favour by the vehemency of his disease, he might have thought that God had cast him off.</note> boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a <note>As destitute of all other help and means and wonderfully afflicted with the sorrow of his disease.</note> potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his <note>Satan uses the same instrument against Job, as he did against Adam.</note> wife unto him, Dost thou <note>Meaning, what do you gain from serving God, seeing he thus plagues you, as though he were your enemy? This is the most grievous temptation for the faithful, when their faith is assailed, and when Satan goes about to persuade them that they trust in God in vain.</note> still retain thine integrity? <note>For death was appointed to the blasphemer and so she meant that he would quickly be rid of his pain.</note> curse God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not <note>That is, to be patient in adversity as we rejoice when he sends prosperity, and so to acknowledge him to be both merciful and just.</note> receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his <note>He so bridled his desires that his tongue through impatience did not murmur against God.</note> lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three <note>Who were men of authority, wise and learned, and as the Septuagint writes, kings, and came to comfort him, but when they saw how he was visited, they conceived an evil opinion of him, as though he was a hypocrite and so justly plagued by God for his sins.</note> friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled <note>This was also a ceremony which they used in those countries as the renting of their clothes in sign of sorrow etc.</note> dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that [his] grief was very <note>And therefore thought that he would not have listened to their counsel.</note> great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened <note>The seven days ended, (Job_2:13).</note> Job his mouth, and <note>Here Job begins to feel his great imperfection in this battle between the spirit and the flesh, (Rom_7:18) and after a manner yields yet in the end he gets victory though he was in the mean time greatly wounded.</note> cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Iob cryed out, and sayd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day <note>Men should not be weary of their life and curse it, because of the infinities that it is subject to, but because they are given to sin and rebellion against God.</note> perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; let not God <note>Let it be put out of the number of days, and let it not have the sight of the sun to separate it from the night.</note> regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the <note>That is, most obscure darkness, which makes them afraid of death that they are in it.</note> shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>Let darkenesse possesse that night, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, nor let it come into the count of the moneths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Yea, desolate be that night, and let no ioy be in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are <note>Who curse the day of their birth, let them lay that curse on this night.</note> ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it <note>Let it be always night, and never see day.</note> see the dawning of the day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not vp the dores of my mothers wombe: nor hid sorowe from mine eyes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and sayde,</verse>
