      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The <note>That is, the sermons and prophecies.</note> words of Jeremiah the son of <note>Who is thought to be he that found the book of the law under king Josiah, (2Ki_22:8).</note> Hilkiah, of the priests that [were] in <note>This was a city about three miles from Jerusalem and belonged to the priests, the sons of Aaron, (Jos_21:18).</note> Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: <note>The Argument - The prophet Jeremiah born in the city of Anathoth in the country of Benjamin, was the son of Hilkiah, whom some think to be he that found the book of the law and gave it to Josiah. This prophet had excellent gifts from God, and most evident revelations of prophecy, so that by the commandment of the Lord he began very young to prophecy, that is, in the thirteenth year of Josiah, and continued eighteen years under the king, three months under Jehoahaz and under Jehoiakim eleven years, three months under Jehoiachin, and under Zedekiah eleven years to the time that they were carried away into Babylon. So that this time amounts to above forty years, besides the time that he prophesied after the captivity. In this book he declares with tears and lamentations, the destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of the people, for their idolatry, covetousness, deceit, cruelty, excess, rebellion and contempt of God's word, and for the consolation of the Church reveals the just time of their deliverance. Here chiefly are to be considered three things. First the rebellion of the wicked, who wax more stubborn and obstinate, when the prophets admonish them most plainly of their destruction. Next how the prophets and ministers of God should not be discouraged in their vocation, though they are persecuted and rigorously handled by the wicked, for God's cause. Thirdly though God shows his just judgment against the wicked, yet will he ever show himself a preserver of his Church, and when all means seem to men's judgment to be abolished, then will he declare himself victorious in preserving his.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>To whom the <note>This is spoken to confirm his calling and office, as he did not presume of himself to preach and prophecy, but was called to it by God.</note> word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the <note>Meaning the nephew of Josiah: for Jehoahaz was his father, who reigned but three months, and therefore is not mentioned, nor is Jehoiakim that reigned no longer.</note> son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth <note>Of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, who was also called Mattaniah, and at this time the Jews were carried away into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar.</note> month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Then the worde of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>Before I <note>The scripture uses this manner of speech to declare that God has appointed his minsters to their offices before they were born, as in (Isa_49:1; Gal_1:15).</note> formed thee in the womb I knew thee; and before thou wast born I sanctified thee, [and] I ordained thee a prophet to the <note>For Jeremiah did not only prophecy against the Jews, but also against the Egyptians, Babylonians, Moabites and other nations.</note> nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then said I, <note>Considering the great judgments of God which according to his threatening would come on the world, he was moved with a certain compassion on the one hand to pity them that would thus perish, and on the other hand by the infirmity of man's nature, knowing how hard a thing it was to enterprise such a charge, as in (Isa_6:11; Exo_3:21, Exo_4:1).</note> Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I [am] a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the Lord said vnto me, Say not, I am a childe: for thou shalt goe to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoeuer I command thee, shalt thou speake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraide of their faces: for I am with thee to deliuer thee, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the LORD put forth his hand, and <note>Which declares that God makes them meet and assures them, whom he calls to set forth his glory, giving them all means necessary for the same, (Exo_4:12; Isa_6:7).</note> touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have this day set thee over the <note>He shows what is the authority of God's true ministers, who by his word have power to bear down whatever lifts itself up against God: and to plant and assure the humble and such as give themselves to the obedience of God's word, (2Co_10:4-5; Heb_4:12), and these are the keys which Christ has left to loose and bind, (Mat_18:18).</note> nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a <note>He joins the sign with the word, for a more ample confirmation: signifying by the rod of the almond tree, which first buds, the hasty coming of the Babylonians against the Jews.</note> rod of an almond tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then saide the Lorde vnto me, Thou hast seene aright: for I will hasten my worde to performe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling <note>Signifying that the Chaldeans and Assyrians would be as a pot to seethe the Jews who boiled in their pleasures and lust.</note> pot; and its face [is] toward the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the LORD said to me, Out of the <note>Syria and Assyria were northward in respect to Jerusalem, which was the Chaldeans dominion.</note> north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For loe, I will call all the families of the kingdomes of the North, saith the Lord, and they shall come, and euery one shall set his throne in the entring of the gates of Ierusalem, and on all the walles thereof rounde about, and in all the cities of Iudah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my <note>I will give them charge and power to execute my vengeance against the idolaters who have forsaken me for their idols.</note> judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I <note>Which declares that God's vengeance is prepared against them who do not execute their duty faithfully, either for fear of man, or for any other reason, (1Co_9:16).</note> confound thee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an <note>Signifying on the one hand that the more that Satan and the world rage against God's ministers, the more present will he be to help them, (Jos_1:5; Heb_13:5) and on the other hand, that they are utterly unfit to serve God in his Church, who are afraid and do not resist wickedness, whatever danger depend on it, (Isa_50:7; Eze_3:8).</note> iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.26.2'>Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the <note>That is, in that place of the temple to which the people resort out of all Judah to sacrifice.</note> court of the LORD'S house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD'S house, all the words that I command thee to speak to them; diminish not a word: <note>To the intent that they should pretend no ignorance, as in (Act_20:27).</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.3'>It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may <note>{{See Jer_7:12}}</note> repent of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.4'>And thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord, If ye will not heare me to walke in my Lawes, which I haue set before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.5'>And to heare ye wordes of my seruants the Prophets, whome I sent vnto you, both rising vp earely, and sending them, and will not obey them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.6'>Then will I make this house like <note>{{See Jer_7:12}}</note> Shiloh, and will make this city <note>So that when they would curse any, they will say, «God do to you as to Jerusalem.»</note> a curse to all the nations of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.7'>So the Priestes, and the Prophets, and all the people heard Ieremiah speaking these wordes in the House of the Lorde.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.8'>Nowe when Ieremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speake vnto all the people, then the Priestes, and the prophets, and all the people tooke him, and saide, Thou shalt die the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.9'>Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, <note>Because of God's promises to the temple, (Psa_132:14) that he would forever remain there, hypocrites thought this temple could never perish and therefore thought it blasphemy to speak against it, (Mat_26:61; Act_6:13) not considering that this was meant of the Church where God will remain forever.</note> This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.10'>When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the <note>So called, because it was repaired by Jotham, (2Ki_15:35).</note> new gate of the LORD'S [house].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.11'>Then spake the Priestes, and the prophets vnto the princes, and to all the people, saying, This man is worthie to die: for he hath prophecied against this citie, as ye haue heard with your eares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.12'>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD <note>He both shows the cause of his doings plainly and also threatens them that nothing would help, though they should put him to death, but heap greater vengeance on their heads.</note> sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.13'>Therefore nowe amende your wayes and your workes, and heare the voyce of the Lorde your God, that the Lorde may repent him of the plague, that he hath pronounced against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.14'>As for me, beholde, I am in your hands: do with me as ye thinke good and right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.15'>But knowe ye for certaine, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood vpon your selues, and vpon this citie, and vpon the inhabitants thereof: for of a trueth the Lord hath sent me vnto you, to speake all these words in your eares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.16'>Then saide the princes and all the people vnto the Priestes, and to the prophets, This man is not worthie to die: for he hath spoken vnto vs in the Name of the Lorde our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.17'>Then rose vp certaine of the Elders of the lande, and spake to all the assemblie of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.18'>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the <note>That is, of the House of the Lord, that is, Zion, and these examples the godly alleged to deliver Jeremiah out of the priests hands, whose rage else would not have been satisfied but by his death.</note> house as the high places of the forest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.19'>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the <note>So that the city was not destroyed, but by a miracle was delivered out of the hands of Sennacherib.</note> evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.20'>And there was also a man that prophecied in the Name of the Lord, one Vriiah the sonne of Shemaiah, of Kiriath-iarem, who prophecied against this citie, and against this lande, according to all the wordes of Ieremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.21'>Nowe when Iehoiakim the King with all his men of power, and all the princes heard his wordes, the King sought to slay him. But when Vriiah heard it, he was afraide and fled, and went into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.22'>And Jehoiakim the king <note>Here is declared the fury of tyrants who cannot stand to hear God's word declared but persecute the ministers of it, and yet in the end they prevail nothing but provoke God' judgments so much more.</note> sent men into Egypt, [namely], Elnathan the son of Achbor, and [certain] men with him into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.23'>And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and <note>As in the first Hezekiah's example is to be followed, so in this other Jehoiakim's act it to be abhorred: for God's plague descended on him and his household.</note> cast his dead body into the burial place of the common people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.26.24'>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam <note>Which declares that nothing could have appeased their fury if God had not moved this noble man to stand valiantly in his defense.</note> the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</verse>
