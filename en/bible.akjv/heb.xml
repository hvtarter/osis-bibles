        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>And as a clothing shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For to the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.  But now we see not yet all things put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>Saying, I will declare your name to my brothers, in the middle of the church will I sing praise to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Why in all things it behooved him to be made like to his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Why I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft on it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like to the Son of God; stays a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there rises another priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For there is truly a cancellation of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people': for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for ever more.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Then truly the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show bread; which is called the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron' rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed to men once to die, but after this the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>And having an high priest over the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>He that despised Moses'law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</verse>
