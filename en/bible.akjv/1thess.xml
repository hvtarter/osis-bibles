        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in to you, that it was not in vain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted to you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and God also, how piously and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Why when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For truly, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And indeed you do it toward all the brothers which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brothers, that you increase more and more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That you may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Why comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work' sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice ever more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesyings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
