        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter' vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.  Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for you have smitten all my enemies on the cheek bone; you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>Salvation belongs to the LORD: your blessing is on your people.  Selah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: you have enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? how long will you love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>There be many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift you up the light of your countenance on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>You have put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for you, LORD, only make me dwell in safety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.1'>Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.2'>Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to you will I pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.3'>My voice shall you hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to you, and will look up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.4'>For you are not a God that has pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.5'>The foolish shall not stand in your sight: you hate all workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.6'>You shall destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.7'>But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy: and in your fear will I worship toward your holy temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.8'>Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.9'>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.10'>Destroy you them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.11'>But let all those that put their trust in you rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because you defend them: let them also that love your name be joyful in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.5.12'>For you, LORD, will bless the righteous; with favor will you compass him as with a shield.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.1'>O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.2'>Have mercy on me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.3'>My soul is also sore vexed: but you, O LORD, how long?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.4'>Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for your mercies'sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.5'>For in death there is no remembrance of you: in the grave who shall give you thanks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.6'>I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.7'>My eye is consumed because of grief; it waxes old because of all my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.8'>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.9'>The LORD has heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.6.10'>Let all my enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.1'>O LORD my God, in you do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.2'>Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.3'>O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.4'>If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.5'>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yes, let him tread down my life on the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.6'>Arise, O LORD, in your anger, lift up yourself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.7'>So shall the congregation of the people compass you about: for their sakes therefore return you on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.8'>The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.9'>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God tries the hearts and reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.10'>My defense is of God, which saves the upright in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.11'>God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.12'>If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.13'>He has also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.14'>Behold, he travails with iniquity, and has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.15'>He made a pit, and dig it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.16'>His mischief shall return on his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down on his own pate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.7.17'>I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.9.3'>When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.4'>For you have maintained my right and my cause; you sat in the throne judging right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.5'>You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have put out their name for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.6'>O you enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and you have destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.7'>But the LORD shall endure for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.8'>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.9.9'>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.10.13'>Why does the wicked scorn God? he has said in his heart, You will not require it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.14'>You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand: the poor commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.10.15'>Break you the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till you find none.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.35'>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.36'>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.37'>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.38'>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.40'>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.41'>Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.45'>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.46'>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.47'>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.48'>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.49'>He cast on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.50'>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.51'>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.78.53'>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.54'>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.55'>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.56'>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.57'>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.58'>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.59'>When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.60'>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy' hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>He gave his people over also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.64'>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.71'>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.72'>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</verse>
