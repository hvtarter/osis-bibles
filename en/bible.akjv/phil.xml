        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God on every remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And many of the brothers in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ'.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your moderation be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now to God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers which are with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar' household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
