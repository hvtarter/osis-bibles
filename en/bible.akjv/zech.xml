        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Zech.1'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>The LORD has been sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Therefore say you to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you to me, said the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>Be you not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor listen to me, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>Cry yet, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>And I said to the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>And the LORD showed me four carpenters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then said I, Where go you? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>Deliver yourself, O Zion, that dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>For, behold, I will shake my hand on them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, see, I come, and I will dwell in the middle of you, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the middle of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with change of raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>And I said, Let them set a fair turban on his head. So they set a fair turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you shall also judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you places to walk among these that stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>In that day, said the LORD of hosts, shall you call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>And two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on the left side thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>And I answered again, and said to him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>And he answered me and said, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>And he said to me, What see you? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that steals shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that swears shall be cut off as on that side according to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>I will bring it forth, said the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the middle of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sits in the middle of the ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the middle of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead on the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>And he said to me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there on her own base.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot spotted and bay horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth toward the south country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then cried he on me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come you the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>And to speak to the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>And when you did eat, and when you did drink, did not you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>Should you not hear the words which the LORD has cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>But they refused to listen, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>Yes, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts has sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, said the LORD of hosts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.8'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Thus said the LORD; I am returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; If it be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes? said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the middle of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>But now I will not be to the residue of this people as in the former days, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>For thus said the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, said the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>So again have I thought in these days to do well to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>These are the things that you shall do; Speak you every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.20'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</verse>
