        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>For the truth' sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked, but that we receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Whoever transgresses, and stays not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that stays in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
