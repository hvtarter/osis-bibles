        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Why, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet for love' sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on my account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience I wrote to you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
