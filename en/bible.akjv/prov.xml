        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains about your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice you, consent you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Cast in your lot among us; let us all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not you in the way with them; refrain your foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which takes away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she utters her words, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make known my words to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But you have set at nothing all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish comes on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then shall they call on me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoever listens to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>My son, if you will receive my words, and hide my commandments with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>So that you incline your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yes, if you cry after knowledge, and lift up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then shall you understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>He keeps the paths of judgment, and preserves the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yes, every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'>When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion shall preserve you, understanding shall keep you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver you from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaks fraudulent things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Whose ways are crooked, and they fraudulent in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house inclines to death, and her paths to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go to her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them on the table of your heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not to your own understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in your own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It shall be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the first fruits of all your increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>So shall they be life to your soul, and grace to your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>Say not to your neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when you have it by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'>Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.30'>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'>Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'>For the fraudulent is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'>Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you good doctrine, forsake you not my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was my father' son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.4'>He taught me also, and said to me, Let your heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.8'>Exalt her, and she shall promote you: she shall bring you to honor, when you do embrace her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.9'>She shall give to your head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.10'>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of your life shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.11'>I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.14'>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.16'>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.17'>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.18'>But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.19'>The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.20'>My son, attend to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.21'>Let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the middle of your heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.24'>Put away from you a fraudulent mouth, and perverse lips put far from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.25'>Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.26'>Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.27'>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove your foot from evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.1'>My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow your ear to my understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.2'>That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.3'>For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.4'>But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.5'>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.6'>Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.7'>Hear me now therefore, O you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.8'>Remove your way far from her, and come not near the door of her house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.9'>Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.10'>Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labors be in the house of a stranger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.11'>And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.12'>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.13'>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.14'>I was almost in all evil in the middle of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.15'>Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.16'>Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.5.21'>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.22'>His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.5.23'>He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.11'>So shall your poverty come as one that travels, and your want as an armed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.12'>A naughty person, a wicked man, walks with a fraudulent mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.13'>He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.14'>Frowardness is in his heart, he devises mischief continually; he sows discord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.15'>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.16'>These six things does the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.17'>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.18'>An heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.6.19'>A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.6.25'>Lust not after her beauty in your heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.</verse>
