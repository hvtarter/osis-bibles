        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD' house should be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Is it time for you, O you, to dwell in your paneled houses, and this house lie waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but you have not enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earns wages earns wages to put it into a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>You looked for much, and, see it came to little; and when you brought it home, I did blow on it. Why? said the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that is waste, and you run every man to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought on the land, and on the mountains, and on the corn, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on men, and on cattle, and on all the labor of the hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then spoke Haggai the LORD' messenger in the LORD' message to the people, saying, I am with you, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, said the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land, said the LORD, and work: for I am with you, said the LORD of hosts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>According to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so my spirit remains among you: fear you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus said the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, said the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the fat press for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labors of your hands; yet you turned not to me, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD' temple was laid, consider it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, has not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And again the word of the LORD came to Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, said the LORD of hosts, will I take you, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, said the LORD, and will make you as a signet: for I have chosen you, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
