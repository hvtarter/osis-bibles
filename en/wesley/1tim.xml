      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, To Timotheus my own son in the faith, grace, mercy, peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I exhorted thee when I was going into Macedonia, abide at Ephesus; that thou mayest charge some to teach no other doctrine, Neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>that afford questions, and not godly edifying, which is through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Whereas the end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>From which some, having missed the mark, are turned aside to vain jangling:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor those concerning which they confidently affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>We know, the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>Knowing this, that the law doth not lie against a righteous man; but against the lawless and disobedient, against the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and prophane, against killers of their fathers or their mothers, against murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>Against whoremongers, sodomites, man-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to wholesome doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I am instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, in that he accounted me faithful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>having put me into the ministry, Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecuter, and a reviler; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>Yet for this cause I obtained mercy, that on me the chief Jesus Christ might shew all long-suffering, for a pattern to them who should hereafter believe in him to life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the king of eternity, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit to thee, son Timotheus, according to the prophecies which went before concerning thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Holding fast faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away, have made shipwreck of their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Among which are Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>For kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>Who willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>the man Christ Jesus, Who gave himself a ransom for all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>to be testified of in due season, Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle, (I speak the truth, I lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>Likewise that women adorn themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety, not with curled hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>For I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>Yet she shall be saved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This is a faithful saying, If a man desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>A bishop therefore must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, prudent, of good behaviour, hospitable, apt to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>Not given to wine, no striker, not desirous of filthy gain, but gentle, patient, not loving money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>Ruling his own house well, having his children in subjection with all seriousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>Not a new convert, left being puffed up, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>He ought also to have a good report from them that are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise the deacons must be serious, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not desirous of filthy gain: Holding fast the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>And let these be proved first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>then let them minister, being found blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>In like manner their wives must be serious, not slanderers, vigilant, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they that have used the office of a deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee shortly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>But if I tarry, that thou mayst know how to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>The mystery of godliness is the pillar and ground of the truth, and without controversy a great thing: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified by the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up into glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the spirit saith expresly, that in the later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>By the hypocrisy of them that speak lies, having their own consciences seared as with an hot iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>For it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If thou remind the brethren of these things, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourishing them with the words of faith, and of the good doctrine whereto thou hast attained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But avoid profane and old wives fables, and exercise thyself unto godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise profiteth a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the present life, and of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>This is faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one despise thy youth; but be a pattern to them that believe, in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Meditate on these things; be wholly in them, that thy profiting may appear in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to thyself and to thy teaching: continue in them, for in so doing thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father, the younger men as brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>The elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honour widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or grand children, let these learn first to shew piety at home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>and to requite their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And enjoin these things, that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own family, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let not a widow be chosen under threescore years old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>having been the wife of one husband, Well reported of for good works, if she hath brought up children, if she hath lodged strangers, if she hath washed the feet of the saints, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But the younger widows refuse; for when they are waxed wanton against Christ, they want to marry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>Having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And withal they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers and busy bodies, speaking what they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I counsel therefore the younger women to marry, bear children, guide the family, give no occasion of reproach to the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For some are already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or woman hath widows, let them relieve them; and let not the church be burthened, that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against an elder receive not an accusation, unless by two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those that sin, rebuke before all, that the rest may fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither partake of other mens sins; keep thyself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Drink water no longer, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thy frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some mens sins are manifest before-hand, going before to judgment: and some they follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In like manner the good works also of some are manifest; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many servants as are under the yoke, account their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of God and his doctrine be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them a service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any teach otherwise, and consent not to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is after godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>He is puffed up, knowing nothing, but being sick of questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, contention, evil speakings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>evil surmisings, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing the gain is godliness. From such withdraw thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with content is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into the world: it is manifest that neither can we carry any thing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>Having then food and covering, with these let us be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they that desire to be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting, have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou art called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge thee, before God, who quickneth all things, and Jesus Christ, who witnessed a good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>That thou keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, Which in his times the blessed and only Potentate will shew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen, neither can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Charge the rich in this world not to be high-minded, neither to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>To do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>Treasuring up for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timotheus, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding prophane, empty babblings, and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called: Which some professing have erred from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Grace be with thee.</verse>
