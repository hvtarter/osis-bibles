      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace and peace be to you from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>Who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>And whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effectual in the patient enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope concerning you is stedfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, of the trouble which befell us in Asia, that we were exceedingly pressed, above our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yea, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raiseth the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust, that he will still deliver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>You likewise helping together with us by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For this is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you, but what ye know and acknowledge, and I trust will acknowledge even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, as ye also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that ye might have had a second benefit, And to pass by you into Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be brought forward by you in my way toward Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Now when I was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that there should be with me yea and nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>As God is faithful, our word to you hath not been yea and nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was preached among you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus was not yea and nay; but was yea in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of God are yea in him, and amen in him, to the glory of God by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>For he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us is God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>Who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith ye have stood.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this with myself not to come to you again in grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I grieve you, who is he that cheareth me, but he that is grieved by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote thus to you, that I might not when I come have grief from those for whom I ought to rejoice; being persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For from much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that ye might be grieved, but that ye might know the abundant love which I have toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>And if any have caused grief, he hath grieved me but in part, that I may not overburden you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient for such an one is this punishment inflicted by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that on the contrary ye should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>I beseech you therefore to confirm your love toward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye were obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: and if I forgive any thing, to whom I forgive it, it is for your sakes, in the person of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>Lest Satan get an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas, to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; so taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God, who causeth us always to triumph through Christ, and manifesteth by us in every place the odour of his knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are to God a sweet odour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To these an odour of death unto death, but to those an odour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as many, who adulterate the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we again begin to recommend ourselves? Unless we need, as some do, recommendatory letters to you, or recommendatory letters from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Ye are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>Manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Such trust have we in God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>And if the ministration of death engraven in letters on stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly on the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished: Shall not rather the ministration of the Spirit be glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>For if the ministration of condemnation was glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is abolished was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore this hope, we use great plainness of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>And not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly to the end of that which is abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their understandings were blinded: and until this day the same veil remaineth unremoved on the reading of the old testament, which is taken away in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But the veil lieth on their heart when Moses is read until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not: But have renounced the hidden things of shame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully corrupting the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled to them that perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>Whose unbelieving minds the god of this world hath blinded, lest the illumination of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to inlighten us with the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are troubled on every side, yet not crushed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; thrown down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>We who live are always delivered unto death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death worketh in us, but life in you. Yet having the same spirit of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>according to what is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will also raise us up by Jesus, and present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things are for your sakes, that the overflowing grace might through the thanksgiving of many abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we faint not, but even though the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>While we aim not at the things that are seen, but the things that are not seen: for the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon, with our house which is from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>If being clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened; not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he that hath wrought us to this very thing is God, who hath also given us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore we always behave undauntedly; knowing that while we are sojourning in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(For we walk by faith, not by sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We behave undauntedly, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore we are ambitious, whether present, or absent, to be well-pleasing to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive according to what he hath done in the body, whether good or evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: but we are made manifest to God, and I trust we are made manifest in your consciences also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>We do not again recommend ourselves to you; but we give you an occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have something to answer them, who glory in appearance, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we are transported beyond ourselves, it is to God; if we are sober, it is for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constraineth us, while we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And that he died for all, that they who live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him who died for them, and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that we from this time know no one after the flesh; yea, if we have known even Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation: the old things are passed way; behold, all things are become new:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are from God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: Namely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their traspasses to them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Therefore we are embassadors for Christ, as though God were intreating by us: we beseech you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he hath made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God through him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We then, as fellow-labourers, do also exhort you, not to receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>(For he saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed, But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>in much patience, in afflictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in necessities, in distresses, In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>By purity, by prudence, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right-hand and the left:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>Through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, yet true, As unknown, yet well-known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as dying, yet behold we live; as chastened, yet not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>As sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O ye Corinthians, our mouth is opened toward you, our heart is inlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>Ye are not straitened in us; but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now for a recompence of the same, (I speak as to my children) be ye also inlarged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion hath light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? Now ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean person, saith the Lord, and I will receive you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And will be to you a Father, and ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore, beloved, these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us. We have hurt no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not, to condemn you; for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts, to live and to die with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my freedom of speech toward you; great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I exceedingly abound with joy, over all our affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side: from without were fightings, from within were fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But God who comforteth them that are brought low, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted over you, when he told us your earnest desire, your grief, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For I do not repent that I grieved you by the letter, though I did repent: (for I see that letter grieved you, though but for a season.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not that ye grieved, but that ye grieved to repentance; for ye grieved in a godly manner, so that ye received damage by us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation not to be repented of, whereas the sorrow of the world worketh death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold, this very thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly manner, what diligence it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge? In all things ye have approved yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>And though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who had done the wrong, nor for his sake who had suffered it, but for the sake of manifesting to you in the sight of God our diligent care over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Therefore we were comforted in your comfort, and we rejoiced the more exceedingly in the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>So that if I had boasted any thing of you to him, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also our boasting to Titus is found a truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how ye received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice therefore, that I have confidence in you in all things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we declare to you the grace of God, bestowed on the churches in Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>That in a great trial of affliction, their overflowing joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>That to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>Praying us with much intreaty, to receive the gift and take a part in ministring it to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And this they did, not as we hoped; but first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also compleat this gift among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by way of command, but that by the diligence of others, I may prove the sincerity of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun a year ago, not only to do, but also to do it willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>Now therefore compleat the work, that as there was a ready will, so there may be also a performance, in proportion to what ye have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be first a ready mind, a man is accepted, according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I do not mean, that others should be eased, and you burthened; But by an equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>let your abundance be at this time a supply to their want; that their abundance also may be a supply to your want, that there may be an equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He that had gathered the most, had nothing over; and he that had gathered the least, did not lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God, who put the same diligent care for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he accepted indeed the exhortation, but being more forward, he went to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise in the gospel is through all the churches: (And not only so,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>but he was also appointed by the churches to be a fellow-traveller with us, with this gift, which is administred by us, to the glory of the Lord himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>and for the declaration of our ready mind) Avoiding this, lest any one should blame us in this abundance, which is administred by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>For we provide things honest, not only before the Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, through his great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-labourer with respect to you; or concerning our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Shew therefore to them before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>For concerning the ministring to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your readiness, which I boast concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I have sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you on this head should be made vain, that, as I said, ye may be ready;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest if any of the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say, you) be ashamed of this confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary, to desire the brethren to go before to you, and compleat this your bounty, which had been spoken of before, that it may be ready as a bounty, and not as a matter of covetousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>And this I say, He that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let every man do as he chuseth in his heart, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a chearful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that having always all sufficiency in all things, ye may abound to every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>(As it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>And may he who supplieth seed to the sower, and bread for your food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>Being inriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which worketh by us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the administration of this service, doth not only supply the necessities of the saints, but likewise aboundeth by the thanksgivings of many to God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>(Who, by experiment of this administration, glorify God for your avowed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal communication to them and to all men.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>And by their prayer for you, who long after you, for the exceeding grace of God, which is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I Paul myself, who when present am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you, intreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>I beseech, that I may not when I am present be bold with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold toward some, who think of us as walking after the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the throwing down of strong-holds.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>Destroying reasonings, and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, now your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do ye look at the outward appearance of things? If any man be confident, that he is Christ's, let him again think this of himself, that as he is Christ's, so we also are Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>Yea, if I should boast something more also of the authority which the Lord hath given us, for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>That I may not seem to terrify you by letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For his letters indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such an one think this, that such as we are in word by letters, when we are absent, such are we also in deed, when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we presume not to equal or to compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves: but they among themselves limiting themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boastingly extend ourselves beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the providence, which God hath allotted us, a measure to reach even unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not extend ourselves excessively, as not reaching to you; for we are come even to you, in the gospel of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>Not boastingly extending ourselves beyond our measure, in the labours of others; but having hope, now your faith is increased, to be inlarged by you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>yet still within our province, abundantly, So as to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, not to boast in another's province of things made ready to our hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I wish ye would bear a little with my folly; yea, bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy; for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear lest as the serpent deceived Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from simplicity toward Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>If indeed he that cometh preach another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>But I suppose that I fall nothing short of the very chief apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>For if I am unskilful in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly manifest to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Have I committed an offence in humbling myself, that ye might be exalted, because I have preached the gospel of God to you at free cost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I spoiled other churches, taking wages of them, to serve you: and when I was present with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>For the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my want; and I have in all things kept myself from being burdensom, and will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, this my boasting shall not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Wherefore?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>Because I love you not? God knoweth. But what I do, I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them who desire occasion, that wherein they boast, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is no great thing, if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose ends shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I speak not after the Lord; but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For ye, being wise, suffer fools willingly. For ye suffer, if a man inslave you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>if he devour you, if he take from you, if he exalt himself, if he smite you on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak with regard to reproach, as though we had been weak: whereas in whatever any is confident, (I speak as a fool) I am confident also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak foolishly) I more: in labours more abundantly, in stripes more exceedingly, in prisons more abundantly, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>Five times I received from the Jews forty stripes save one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I have been shipwrecked, a day and a night I passed in the deep: In journeyings often,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the heathen; in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>In labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>Beside the things which are from without, that which rusheth upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>Since I must glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor under king Aretas, kept the city of the Damascenes with a guard, being determined to apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>But I was let down through a window in a basket by the wall, and escaped from his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>Surely it is not expedient for me to boast: yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I knew a man in Christ, above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body I know not; God knoweth) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>Yea, I knew such a man (whether in the body or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) That he was caught up into paradise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>and heard unspeakable things, which it is not possible for man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Of such an one I will glory; but I will not glory of myself, unless in my infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I should resolve to boast, I should not be a fool; for I speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think of me above what he seeth me, or heareth from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And lest I should be lifted up with the abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the strength of Christ may rest upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I am become a fool in boasting; but ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing have I fallen short of the very chief apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For wherein were ye inferior to the other churches, unless that I myself was not burdensom to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Forgive me this wrong. Behold the third time I am ready to come to you: yet I will not be burdensom to you; for I seek not yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up treasure for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I will most gladly spend, and be spent for your souls, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But be it so: I did not burden you: but being crafty, I caught you with guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Think ye that we again excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all things, beloved, for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear lest when I come, I should not find you such as I would, and lest I should be found by you such as ye would not: lest there should be contentions, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults, Lest my God should humble me when I come to you again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>and I should mourn over many of them who had sinned before, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>I am coming to you this third time: every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I told you before, and do tell before-hand (though now absent, as if I were present the second time) those who had sinned before, and all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but powerful among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God: and we also are weak with him; but we shall live with him, by the power of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Examine yourselves, whether ye are in the faith: prove yourselves. Do ye not know yourselves? That Jesus Christ is in you? unless ye are reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>And I trust, ye shall know, that we are not reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray God, that ye may do no evil: not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is good, though we should be as reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use severity, according to the power which the Lord hath given me, for edification, and not for destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally, brethren, farewel: be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Salute one another with an holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.</verse>
