      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of eternal life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>which is by Jesus Christ, To Timotheus, my beloved son, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that I have remembrance of thee in my prayers without ceasing night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>Longing to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>Remembering the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; I am persuaded in thee also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, to stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>For God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of power, and love, and sobriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Therefore be not thou ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of God, Who hath saved and called us with an holy calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But is now made manifest, by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>For which cause also I suffer these things: yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have trusted, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him, until that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Hold fast the pattern of sound words, which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>The good thing which is committed to thee keep, through the Holy Spirit, who dwelleth in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>This thou knowest, that all who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>The Lord give mercy to the family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>The Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day: And in how many things he served me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>Thou therefore, my son, be strong through the grace which is by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>And the things which thou hast heard from me before many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Thou therefore endure affliction, is a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>No man that warreth intangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath inlisted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>And if a man strive, he is not crowned, unless he strive lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>The husbandman, that laboureth first, must be partaker of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Remember Jesus Christ of the seed of David, raised from the dead according to my gospel; For which I endure affliction even unto bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>as an evil-doer, but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>Therefore I suffer all things for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is through Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>It is a faithful saying: if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if we deny him, he will also deny us: If we believe not, he remaineth faithful; he cannot deny himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord, not to strive about words, to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Be diligent to present thyself unto God approved a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>But avoid profane empty babblings; for they will increase to more ungodliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>And their word will eat as a gangrene; of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>Who have erred from the faith, saying, The resurrection is already past, and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>But the foundation of God standeth fast, having this seal, The Lord knoweth those that are his: and, Let every one who nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of stone; and some to honour, some to dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, consecrated and fit for the master's use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Flee also youthful desires; but follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call upon the Lord, out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>And a servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle toward all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>apt to teach, patient of evil, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if haply God may give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>And they may awake out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>But know this, that in the last days grievous times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, arrogant, proud, evil-speakers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, Without natural affection, covenant-breakers, slanderers, intemperate, fierce, despisers of good men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>Traitors, rash, puffed up, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>Having a form of godliness but denying the power of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>From these also turn away. For of these are they who creep into houses, and captivate silly women laden with sins, led away by various desires,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth: men of corrupt minds, void of judgment as to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, intention, faith, long-suffering, love, patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>Persecutions, afflictions, which befel me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured; but the Lord delivered me out of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yea and all that are resolved to live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and been fully assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>And that from an infant thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, thro' faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All scripture is inspired of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the quick and dead at his appearing and his kingdom, Preach the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>be instant in season, out of season; convince, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine, but will heap to themselves teachers, according to their own desires, having itching ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>And they will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside to fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But watch thou in all things, endure affliction, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am now ready to be offered up, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will render me in that day, and not to me only, but to all them likewise that have loved his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Do thy diligence to come to me shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>For Demas hath forsaken me, loving the present world, and is gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>When thou comest, bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; the Lord will reward him according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>Of whom be thou also aware; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first defence no man was with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the preaching might be fully known, even that all nations might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory for ever, and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Amen. Salute Aquila and Priscilla and the family of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I have left at Miletus sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</verse>
