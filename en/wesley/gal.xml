  <div osisID='Gal' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul an apostle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>who raised him from the dead) And all the brethren who are with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>to the churches of Galatia, Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, Who gave himself for our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>(that he might deliver us from the present evil world ) according to the will of God and our Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Christ who called you by his grace to another gospel, Which is not another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>but there are some that trouble you, and would subvert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But if we or an angel from heaven preach to you another gospel than we have preached to you, let him be accursed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, so I say now again, if any preach to you another gospel than that ye received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now satisfy men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For neither did I receive it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard of my behaviour in time past in the Jewish religion, that above measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I profited in the Jewish religion above many of my years among my countrymen, being more abundantly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>Neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them that were apostles before me, but I immediately went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But other of the apostles I saw none, save James, the brother of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now the things which I write to you, behold before God, I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>Only they had heard, He that persecuted in time past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>I went up by revelation, and explained to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles; but severally to those of eminence, lest by any means I should run, or should have run in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>(But neither was Titus, who was with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised, Because of false brethren introduced unawares, who came in privily, to spy out our liberty which we have through Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>To whom we did not yield by submission, no, not an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>And they who undoubtedly were something, (but whatsoever they were, it is no difference to me; God accepteth no man's person) they who undoubtedly were something in conference, added nothing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But on the contrary, when they saw that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought likewise effectually in me toward the Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>) And when James, and Cephas, and John, who undoubtedly were pillars, knew the grace that was given to me, they gave the right-hands of fellowships to me and Barnabas, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision: Only they desired that we would be mindful of the poor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>the same which I also was forward to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews also dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw, that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If thou being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We who are Jews by nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>and not sinners of the Gentiles, Even we (knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ) have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ therefore the minister of sin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>God forbid. For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified with Christ, and I live no longer, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness is by the law, then Christ died in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O thoughtless Galatians, who hath bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn of you, Did you receive the Spirit, by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so thoughtless? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>If it be yet in vain? Doth he that ministreth the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>As Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know then, that they who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared before the glad tidings to Abraham, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that none is justified by the law in the sight of God, is evident; for the just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>Now the law is not of faith; but the man that doeth them, shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>) That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>I speak after the manner of men: though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, none disannulleth or addeth thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, the covenant which was before confirmed of God through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance be by the law, it is no more by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Wherefore then was the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made: and it was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now the mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is then the law against the promises of God? God forbid. But if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up together unto the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Wherefore the law was our school-master unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But faith being come, we are no longer under a school-master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye are all sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if ye are Christ's, then are ye the seed of Abraham, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>But is under tutors and stewards, till the time appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem those under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>Indeed then, when ye knew not God, ye served them that by nature are not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now having known God, or rather being known of God, how turn ye back to the weak and beggarly elements, to which ye desire to be in bondage again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. I am afraid for you, lest I have laboured upon you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>Brethren, I beseech you, be ye as I am; for I also am as ye were: ye have not injured me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Ye know how though infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>And ye did not slight or disdain my temptation which was in the flesh, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>For I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>Now it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only while I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, ye that would be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, Abraham had two sons, one by the bond-woman, another by the free-woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>And he of the bond-woman was born after the flesh, but he of the free-woman by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things are an allegory; for these are the two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Agar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>(For it is written, Rejoice thou barren, that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so it is now also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I Paul say unto you, If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Christ is become of no effect to you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye did run well: who hath hindered you, that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion cometh not from him that called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded; but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But if I, brethren, preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>Then is the offence of the cross ceased. I would they were even cut off that trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>Brethren, ye have been called to liberty: only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>I say then, walk by the Spirit, and fulfil not the desire of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh desireth against the Spirit, but the Spirit desireth against the flesh (these are contrary to each other) that ye may not do the things which ye would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, contentions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>emulations, wraths, strifes, divisions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of which I tell you before (as I have also told you in time past) that they who practise such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Meekness, temperance; against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with its affections and desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Be not desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault, ye who are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if any man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him that is taught in the word impart to him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>But let us not be weary of well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>Therefore as we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men; but especially to them who are of the houshold of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>Ye see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised: only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither they who are circumcised keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From henceforth let none trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brethren, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirit. Amen.</verse>
