      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in things concerning the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is after godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>And he hath in due time manifested his word, thro' the preaching wherewith I am intrusted, according to the commandment of God our Saviour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus my own son after the common faith, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou mightest set in order the things which remain, and ordain elders in every city, as I appointed thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of luxury or unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not passionate, not given to wine, no striker, not desirous of filthy gain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, prudent, just, holy, temperate, Holding fast the faithful word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly vain-talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of filthy gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, a prophet of their own, hath said, The Cretans are always liars, evil wild-beasts, lazy gluttons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true; therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the clean all things are clean; but to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean; but both their understanding and conscience are defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and void of judgment as to every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine, That the aged men be vigilant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>serious, prudent, sound in faith, love, patience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>That the aged women in like manner, be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>That they instruct the young women to be wise, to love their husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to love their chidren, Discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>The young men likewise exhort to be discreet, In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>in doctrine, uncorruptness, seriousness, Sound speech that cannot be reproved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>that he who is on the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters, to please them in all things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not answering again, Not stealing, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may in all things adorn the gospel of God our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the saving grace of God hath appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Teaching us, that, having renounced ungodliness and all wordly desires, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority: let no man despise thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>To speak evil of no man, not to be quarrelsome, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, inslaved to various desires and pleasures, living in wickedness and envy, hateful, hating one another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness and philanthropy of God our Saviour appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Which he poured forth richly upon us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>through Jesus Christ our Saviour, That, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, to the end that they who have believed in God, be careful to excel in good works: these things are good and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>An heretic after a first and second admonition reject,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Knowing that such an one is perverted and sinneth, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas or Tychicus to thee, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Send forward with diligence Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that they may want nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let ours also learn to excell in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.</verse>
