      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>and to the faithful in Christ Jesus, Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places through Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>As he hath chosen us through him, before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and blameless before him in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>Having predestinated us to the adoption of sons to himself by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>To the praise of the glory of his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>by which he hath freely accepted us through the beloved, By whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>according to the riches of his grace, Wherein he hath abounded toward us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>in all wisdom and prudence, Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>That in the dispensation of the fulness of the times, he might gather together into one in Christ all things which are in heaven, and which are in earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In him through whom we also have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the counsel of his own will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>That we who first believed in Christ, might be to the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In whom ye likewise believed, after ye had heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom having believed, ye were also sealed by that Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>Who is an earnest of our inheritance, till the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Wherefore I also, since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, through the knowledge of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>The eyes of your understanding being inlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>And what the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the energy of his mighty power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>Which he wrought in Christ, raising him from the dead; and he hath made him sit at his own right-hand in heavenly places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And he hath put all things under his feet, and hath given him to be head over all things to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>Which is his body; who is the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And he hath quickened you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>who were dead in trespasses and sins, Wherein ye formerly walked, according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience: Among whom also we all had our conversation in time past,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>in the desires of the flesh, doing the will of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God who is rich in mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>through his great love wherewith he loved us, Hath quickened us together with Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses, (by grace ye are saved) And hath raised us up together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and made us sit together in heavenly places through Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>That he might shew in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace ye are saved through faith; and this not of yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his workmanship, created through Christ Jesus unto good works, which God had before prepared, that we might walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh (who were called the uncircumcision, by that which is called the circumcision made with hands in the flesh) Were at that time without Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise; having no hope, and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now through Christ Jesus, ye who were once far off are brought nigh by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, he who hath made both one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>having broken down the middle wall of partition, Having abolished by his flesh the enmity, the law of commandments, through his decrees, that he might make the two one new man in himself, so making peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>And might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And he came and preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Therefore ye are no longer strangers, and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the houshold of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, On whom all the building fitly framed together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>groweth into an holy temple in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>On whom ye also are built together, for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause I Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, (Seeing ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>given me to you ward, That by revelation he made known to me the mystery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>By reading which ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to the holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>That the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and joint-partakers of his promise by Christ through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>Of which I have been made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>And to let all men see, what is the fellowship of the mystery, which was hidden from the beginning of the world by God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>That the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in heavenly places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>By whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Wherefore I intreat you not to faint at my afflictions for you, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>(Of whom the whole</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>family in heaven and earth is named) That he would give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, That Christ may dwell in your heart by faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>That being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, And to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>that ye may be filled with all the fulness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you, to walk worthy of the calling wherewith ye are called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>forbearing one another in love, Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, by the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body and one Spirit, as ye are also called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>One Lord, one faith, one baptism:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>One God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Wherefore he saith, Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>(Now that he ascended, what is it, but that he also descended first to the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He that descended is the same that ascended also, far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, to the edifying the body of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>Till we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>That we may be no longer children, fluctuating to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, by cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted, by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every member, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles, in the vanity of your mind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, by the ignorance that is in them, through the hardness of their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Who being past feeling, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But ye have not so learned Christ; Since ye have heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>and been taught by him, (as the truth is in Jesus) To put off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>concerning your former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful desires:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>To be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>And to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be ye angry, and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>Neither give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt discourse proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good, to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking be put away from you with all malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted; forgiving one another; as God also for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be ye therefore followers of God, as beloved children: And walk in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But let not fornication, or any uncleanness, or covetousness be even named among you, as becometh saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>Neither obscenity, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient, but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, or unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with vain words; for because of these things the wrath of God cometh upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For ye were once darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>walk as children of light; (The fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Searching what is acceptable to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is a shame even to speak the things which are done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that ye walk circumspectly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>not as fools, but as wise men, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not drunken with wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>wherein is excess; but be ye filled with the Spirit, Speaking to each other in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your hearts unto the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>Giving thanks always for all things to God even the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is head of the wife, as Christ also is head of the church:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>(and he is the Saviour of the body) Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>That he might sanctify it (having cleansed it by the washing of water) through the word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, that it may be holy and unblamable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Men ought so to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>Now no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also the Lord the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery; I mean, concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>But let every one of you in particular so love his wife as himself: and let the wife reverence her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honour</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise) That it may be well with thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>and thou mayst live long upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>With good will doing service as unto the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>Knowing that whatsoever good each man doth, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be a servant or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatning, knowing that your master is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, brethren, be strong through the Lord, and through the power of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world, of the darkness of this age, against wicked spirits in heavenly places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Wherefore take to you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>And having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.18'>which is the word of God, Praying alway by the Spirit with all prayer and supplication, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.19'>And for me that utterance may be given me, by the opening my mouth to make known boldly the mystery of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.20'>For which I am an ambassador in bonds, that I may speak boldly therein, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.21'>But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.22'>Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.23'>Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
