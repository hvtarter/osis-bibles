      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have undertaken to compose a narrative of the facts which have been fully confirmed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>Even as they who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word from the beginning, delivered them to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having accurately traced all things from their first rise, to write unto thee in order, most noble Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That thou mayst know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And while he executed the priest's office before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>in the order of his course, According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn the incense, going into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias seeing him was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And thou shalt have joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speak to thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, thou shalt be deaf, and not able to speak, till the day that these things are done, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And coming out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived, that he had seen a vision; for he beckoned to them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when the days of his ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after these days, his wife Elisabeth conceived,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>and hid herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord done to me, in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God, to a city of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>named Nazareth, To a virgin of the house of David, espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel coming in to her, said, Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she seeing him, was troubled at his saying, and reasoned, what manner of salutation this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob; for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born, shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God, nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the hill-country, into a city of Judah ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb: and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And cried with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For lo! when the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And happy is she that believed; for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath wrought strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He hath filled the hungry with good things, but sent the rich empty away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath helped his servant Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>in remembrance of his mercy, As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elisabeth's full time came, that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and relations heard, that the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>But his mother answering said, Nay, but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were noised abroad, in all the hill-country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in the house of his servant David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began: That we should be saved from our enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That he would grant us, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>to serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, shalt be a prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Thro' the tender mercy of our God, whereby the Day-spring from on high hath visited us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his being shewn to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And in those days there went out a decree from Augustus Cesar, that all the world should be inrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(Now this first inrolment was made, when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be inrolled, every one to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>(because he was of the family and houshold of David) To be inrolled with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And while they were there, the days were fulfilled, that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her son, the first-born, and swathed him, and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds, lying out in the field, and keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And lo an angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For to you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this shall be a sign to you; ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>and on earth peace; goodwill toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is done, which the Lord hath made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And having seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all that heard wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, comparing them together in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were fulfilled, to circumcise the child, his name was called Jesus, which was named of the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of purification were fulfilled according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>openeth the womb shall be holy to the Lord) And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and religious, waiting for the Consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>He took him up in his arms, and blessed God and said, Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation: Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be spoken against,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(Yea, and a sword shall pierce thro' thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers, night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in at that hour, gave thanks to the Lord, and spake of him to all that were waiting for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed all things, according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year, at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew it not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and sought him among their kinsfolk and among their acquaintance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And not finding him, they went back to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished, at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And seeing him they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou done thus to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, Why sought ye me? Knew ye not, that I must be about my Father's business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the saying which he spake to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas being the high priest and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth: And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>Then said he to the multitudes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>that came forth to be baptized of him, Ye brood of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance; and say not within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father; for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And now also the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the multitude asked him, saying, What then shall we do? He answering saith to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him, Master, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, Exact no more than what is appointed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And the soldiers likewise asked him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And as the people were in expectation, and all mused in their hearts of John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>whether he were not the Christ, John answered saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>And many other things in his exhortation preached he to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and concerning all the evils which Herod had done, Added also this above all,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee; but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Jesus hearing these things, marvelled at him, and turning, said to the people that followed him, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they that had been sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And he went afterward to a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him and a great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And as he drew nigh the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a great multitude of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And the Lord seeing her, was moved with tender compassion for her, and said, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up, and began to speak: and he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is risen up among us; and, God hath visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this rumour of him went forth through all Judea, and all the country round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. And John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>calling to him two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And the men being come to him, said, John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues, and of evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answering said to them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: the blind see; the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; to the poor the gospel is preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And happy is he, whosoever shall not be offended at me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John were departed, he said to the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>A reed shaken by the wind? But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold they that are splendidly apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>For I say to you, among those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and scribes made void the counsel of God, toward themselves, being not baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To whom then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>And one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, he sat down to table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold a woman in the city, who had been a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>brought an alabaster box of ointment, And standing at his feet behind him weeping, watered his feet with a shower of tears, and wiped them, with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>But the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known, who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>But they having nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both: Which therefore will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answering said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most. He said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And turning to the woman, he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath watered my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>Thou didst not anoint my head with oil: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Wherefore I say to thee, Those many sins of her's are forgiven; therefore she loved much: but he to whom little is forgiven, loveth little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. And they that sat at table with him said within themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And afterward he went through every city and village preaching and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven devils,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And much people being gathered together, coming to him out of every city, he spake by a parable, A sower went forth to sow his seed:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon a rock, and springing up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred fold. And saying these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, What is this parable?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others in parables, so that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root, who for a while believe; but in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>That which fell among thorns are they, who, having heard, go forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are they, who, having heard the word, keep it in an honest and good heart, and bring forth fruit with perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No man having lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold there came a man named Jairus, and he was ruler of the synagogue; and falling down at the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him, declared to him before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh Jerusalem, and because they thought the kingdom of God would immediately appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade till I come.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because thou hast been faithful in a very little, be thou governor over ten cities.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>And he said to him likewise, Be thou also over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>And another came saying, Lord, behold thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layest not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garments on the colt and set Jesus thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And when he was now come nigh, at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>Saying, Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And as he drew near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, O that thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day the things that are for thy peace. But now they are hid from thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and press thee on every side,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps seeing him they will reverence him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>And hearing it they said, God forbid. And he looked on them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Whosoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And watching him, they sent forth spies, feigning themselves to be just men, to take hold of his discourse, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know, that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou persons, but teachest the way of God in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us, to give tribute to C?sar, or no?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>For seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But they who are accounted worthy to obtaan that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>For neither can they die any more; for they are equal to angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the people who had come together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned, smiting their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor, a good man and a just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(He had not consented to the counsel and deed of them) of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man going to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with him from Galilee, following after, beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And returning they prepared spices and ointments, and rested the sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices, which they had prepared and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre, And entering, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And while they were perplexed concerning it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>behold two men stood by them in shining garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returning from the sepulchre, told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rising, ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he seeth the linen clothes laid by themselves; and he went home, wondring at what was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold two of them were going the same day to a village called Emmaus, which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And as they talked and argued together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were holden, so that they did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What discourses are these that ye have one with another, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Dost thou alone even sojourn at Jerusalem, and hast not known the things, which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Those concerning Jesus of Nazareth (who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>) How our chief priests and rulers delivered him to be condemned to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>and have crucified him, But we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, to-day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea, and certain women of our company astonished us, who were early at the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not finding his body, they came, saying, That they had seen also a vision of angels, who say, he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of the men who were with us, went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said; but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them, O foolish, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things in all the scriptures, concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew nigh the village whither they were going, and he made as tho' he would go farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day declines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And he went in, to abide with them. And as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he was talking to us in the way, and opening the scriptures to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven met together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told the things done in the way, and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they spake thus, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But being terrified and affrighted, they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having spoken this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any meat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, that all things written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms concerning me, must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>to understand the scriptures, And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And ye are witnesses of these things. And behold I send the promise of my Father upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>but tarry in the city Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethany; and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.</verse>
