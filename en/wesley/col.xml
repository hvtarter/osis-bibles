      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus a brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colosse, grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, (praying always for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>Hearing of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>your love to all the saints) For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>of which ye heard before in the word of truth, Which is come to you, as also it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it hath done likewise among you, from the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>As ye likewise learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>Who also declared to us your love in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this cause from the day we heard it, we do not cease to pray also for you, and to desire that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>That ye may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to partake of the inheritance of the saints in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>Who is the image of the invisible God, the first begotten of every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>For through him were created all things, that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible; whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist, And he is the head of his body the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>who is the beginning, the first-begotten from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For it pleased the Father, that all fulness should dwell in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>And by him to reconcile all things to himself (having made peace by him, through the blood of the cross ) whether things on earth, or things in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>And you that were once alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>he hath now reconciled, By the body of his flesh, through death, to present you holy, and spotless, and unreproveable in his sight:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>If ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and are not removed from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard, which is preached to every creature that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ for his body, which is the church:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>Of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which is given me for you, fully to preach the word of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>The mystery which hath been hid from ages and generations; but now is manifested to his saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To whom among the Gentiles it was the will of God to make known, what is the riches of this glorious mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, that we may present every man perfect through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>For which also I labour, striving according to his mighty working, who worketh in me mightily.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I would have you know, how great a conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>That their hearts may be comforted, being knit together in love, even unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the acknowledgment of the mystery of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>both the Father and Christ, In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>And this I say, that no man may beguile you with inticing words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent from you in the flesh, yet I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to behold your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest any man make a prey of you through philosophy and empty deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of this world, and not after Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For in him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And ye are filled by him, who is the head of all principality and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>By whom also ye are circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>Buried with him in baptism, by which ye are also risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you who were dead in trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having forgiven you all trespasses, Having blotted out by his decrees the hand-writing against us, which was contrary to us; and having nailed it to his cross, he took it out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>And having spoiled the principalities and powers, he exposed them openly, triumphing over them in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let none therefore judge you in meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast-day, or of the new-moon, or of sabbath-days: Which are shadow of things to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>but the body is of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let none defraud you of your reward by a voluntary humility and worship of angels, intruding into the things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>And not holding the head, from which all the body being nourished and knit together, by the joints and ligaments, increaseth with the increase of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>Therefore if ye are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, receive ye ordinances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>(Touch not, taste not, handle not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>All which are to perish in the using) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>Which things (though they have indeed a shew of wisdom, in voluntary worship and humility, and not sparing the body) yet are not of any value, but are to the satisfying of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If ye then are risen with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ sitteth at the right-hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your affections on the things above, not the things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ, our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>For which things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>In which ye also once walked, when ye lived in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now put ye also all these things off, anger, wrath, ill-nature, evil speaking, filthy discourse out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And above all these put on love, which is the bond of perfection:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And the peace of God shall rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body: and be ye thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands (as is fit) in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he that doth wrong, shall receive for the wrong he hath done; and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, give your servants that which is just and equitable, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue in prayer, and watch therein with thanksgiving:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>Withal, praying likewise for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ: for which I am also in bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All my concerns will Tychicus declare to you, a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that he might know your state and comfort your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you: they will make known to you all things that are done here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas; (touching whom ye have received directions, if he come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>receive him,) And Jesus, called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these are the only fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayer, that ye may stand, perfect and filled, with all the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I bear him witness, that he hath a great zeal for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Salute the brethren at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Take heed that thou fulfil the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation of me Paul by my own hand. Be mindful of my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
