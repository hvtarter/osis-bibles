  <div osisID='1Thess' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, Grace be unto you and Peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all (making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>Remembring without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of our God and Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>) Knowing, beloved brethren, your election of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also with power, and with the Holy Ghost, and with much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you, for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And ye became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that ye became examples to all that believed in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you the word of the Lord sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith toward God went abroad in every place also, so that we need not speak any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves declare concerning us, what manner of entrance to you we had, and how ye turned from idols to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>to serve the living and true God, And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he hath raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance to you, that it was not in vain: But even after we had suffered before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>and had been shamefully intreated at Philippi, as ye know, we were bold thro' our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation is not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness: God is witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor sought we glory of men, neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as the Apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were gentle in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>So, loving you tenderly, we were ready to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own souls also, because ye were dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>Ye are witnesses and God, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved among you that believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As ye know how we exhorted and comforted every one of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>as a father his own children, And charged you to walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, even because when ye received the word of God from us, ye received it, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, who likewise effectually worketh in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God in Christ Jesus, which are in Judea; for ye also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they likewise from the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and are contrary to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: but wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, laboured with great desire the more abundantly to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Wherefore we would have come to you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not ye also before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For ye are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore when we could bear no longer, we thought good to be left at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God and our fellow-worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>That no one might be moved by these afflictions; for ye know that we are appointed hereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For when we were with you we told you before, we should be afflicted; as it came to pass, and ye know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Therefore when I could bear no longer, I sent to know your faith, left by any means the tempter should have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timotheus was come to us from you, and had brought us the good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, as we also to see you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you, in, all our affliction and distress by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sake before our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day praying exceedingly, that we may see your face, and perfect that which is wanting in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love towards one another and towards all men, as we also do towards you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>That he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness (before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ) with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>It remaineth then, brethren, that we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, that ye abound therein more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>That every one of you know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>Not in passionate desire, as the Gentiles who know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That none circumvent or defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all these things, as we have also told you before and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man but God; who hath also given you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>Touching brotherly love, we need not write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia; but we exhort you, brethren, that ye increase more and more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>That ye may walk decently toward them that are without, and may want nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe, that Jesus died and rose again, so will God bring with him those also that sleep in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left to the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>Ye are all children of the light and children of the day: we are not children of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep as the others, but let us awake and keep awake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us who are of the day keep awake, having put on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God hath not appointed us to wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we may live together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore comfort one another and edify one another, as also ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labour among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, And to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, and be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be long suffering toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that none render to any man evil for evil, but ever follow that which is good, both to one another and to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice evermore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing: In every thing give thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesyings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and may the whole of you, the spirit and the soul and the body, be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brethren with an holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
