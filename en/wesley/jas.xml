      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>James a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>My brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations, Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>But let patience have it's perfect work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>that ye may be perfect and intire, wanting nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>But the rich, in that he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun arose with a burning heat, and withered the grass, and the flower fell off, and the beauty of it's appearance perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Happy is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>Let no man when he is tempted say, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own desire and inticed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then desire having conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin being perfected, bringeth forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>descending from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>Therefore laying aside all the filthiness and superfluity of wickedness, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if any one be an hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>For he beheld himself, and went away, and immediately forgot what manner of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But whoso looketh diligently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continueth therein, this man being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word, this man shall be happy in his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any one be ever so religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspoted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>in fine apparel, and there come in also a poor man in dirty raiment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>And ye look upon him that weareth the fine apparel, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>Stand thou there, or, Sit thou here under my footstool, Ye distinguish not in yourselves, but are become evil-reasoning judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But ye have disgraced the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment-seats? Do not they blaspheme that worthy name, by which ye are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If ye fulfil the royal law (according to the Scripture) Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. If then thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak ye and so act, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment without mercy shall be to him that shewed no mercy: mercy glorieth over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>What doth it profit, my brethren, tho' a man say he hath faith, and have not works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>Can that faith save him? If a brother or a sister be naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and want daily food, And one of you say to them, Depart in peace; be ye warmed and filled, but give them not the things needful for the body, what doth it profit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>So likewise faith, if it hath not works, is dead in itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But one will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>Thou believest there is one God: thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>But art thou willing to know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>Thou seest that faith wrought together with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>Ye see then, that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>In like manner Rahab the harlot also was justified by works, having received the messengers and sent them out another way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>Therefore as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive greater condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For in many things we offend all. If any one offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>Behold we put bits into the horses mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>Behold also the ships, tho' they are so great, and driven by fierce winds, yet are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the pilot listeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>So the tongue also is a little member, yet boasteth great things. Behold how much matter a little fire kindleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: it is the tongue among the members which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every kind both of wild beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>But the tongue can no man tame: it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>Therewith bless we God the Father, and therewith curse we man, made after the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Doth a fountain send out of the same place sweet water and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries, or a vine figs? So can no fountain yield salt water and fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is a wise and knowing man among you? Let him shew by a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if ye have bitter zeal and strife in your hearts, do not glory and lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where bitter zeal and strife is, there is unquietness and every evil work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>without partiality and without dissimulation, And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Is it not hence, from your pleasures that war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>Ye desire and have not, ye kill, and envy, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may expend it on your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>Ye adulterers and adultresses, know ye not, that the friendship of the world is enmity against God? Whosoever therefore desireth to be a friend of the world, is an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do ye think, that the scripture saith in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth against envy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he giveth greater grace: therefore it saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Submit yourselves, therefore, to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you: cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves in the sight of God, and he will lift you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>There is one lawgiver that is able to save and to destroy: Who art thou that judgest another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go to such a city, and continue there a year, and traffick, and get gain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>Who know not what shall be on the morrow; for what is your life? It is a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>Instead of your saying, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now ye glory in your boastings: all such glorying is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Go to now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver is cankered, and the canker of them shall be a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire: ye have laid up treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Behold the hire of your labourers who have reaped your fields, which is kept back by you, crieth: and the cries of them who have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabbaoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>Ye have lived delicately on earth, and been wanton; ye have cherished your hearts, as in a day of sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just: he doth not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath patience for it, till he receive the early and the latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Murmur not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned; behold the judge standeth before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Behold, we count them happy that have endured. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord: for the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, lest ye fall into condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any chearful? let him sing psalms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess your faults one to another, brethren, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed: the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of like passions with us; and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the land for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and so the land gave forth her fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>Brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one convert him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>Let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</verse>
