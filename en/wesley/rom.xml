      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated to the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>Which he had promised before, by his prophets in the holy scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>Concerning his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was of the seed of David, according to the flesh, But declared the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith in all nations for his name, Among whom are ye also, the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>To all that are in Rome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>who are beloved of God, called and holy, Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ, for you all, that your faith is spoken of through the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how incessantly I make mention of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>Always requesting in my prayers to come unto you, if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that ye may be established, That is, to be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you, (though I have been hindred hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>Therefore, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, both to the Jew and to the Gentile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For the righteousness of God is revealed therein from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who detain the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>For what is to be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For those things of him which are invisible, both his eternal power and Godhead, are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the things which are made, so that they are without excuse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because knowing God, they did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image in the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed creatures and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness in the desires of their hearts, to dishonour their bodies among themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature above the creator, who is blessed for ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>Amen. Therefore God gave them up to vile affections; for even their women changed the natural use to that which is against nature: And likewise also the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>leaving the natural use of the women, burned in their lust toward each other, men with men working filthiness, and receiving in themselves the just recompence of their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they were not careful to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an undiscerning mind, to do things not expedient, Filled with all injustice, maliciousness, covetousness, wickedness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>Whisperers, backbiters: haters of God, violent, proud: boasters, inventers of evil things: disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest; for wherein thou judgest the other, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>For we know that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them who do such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest them that do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself wrath in the day of wrath, and revelation, and righteous judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>Who will render to every one according to his works: To them that by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>and honour, and immortality, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be indignation and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and anguish, Even upon every soul of man who worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also the Gentile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, honour, and peace shall be to every one who worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For as many as have sinned without the law, shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law, shall be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these not having the law, are a law to themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>Who shew the work of the law written upon their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or even defending them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus, according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and gloriest in God, And knowest his will, and discernest the things that differ, being instructed out of the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>And art confident, that thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, An instructer of the ignorant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that proclaimest, a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>Thou that sayst, a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>Thou that gloriest in the law, dost thou by transgressing the law dishonour God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou keepest the law; but if thou art a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>Yea, the uncircumcision that is by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision transgressest the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew, who is one in outward shew, neither is that circumcision which is apparent in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then is the advantage of the Jew, or what the profit of the circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much every way; chiefly in that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some believed not? Shall their unbelief disannul the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>God forbid: let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who taketh vengeance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>I speak as a man. God forbid; for then how should God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But if the truth of God hath abounded to his glory through my lie, why am I still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why may we not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm us to say) do evil, that good may come? Whose damnation is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we better than they? In no wise: for we have before proved all, both Jews and Gentiles, to be under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They have all turned aside; they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery are in their ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And they have not known the way of peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>The fear of God is not before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be found guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore no flesh shall be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But the righteousness of God without the law is now manifested, being attested by the law and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>Even the righteousness of God, by the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all that believe; for there is no difference:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>And are justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>Whom God hath set forth as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness by the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God: For a demonstration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>I say, of his righteousness in this present time, that he might be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Nay, but by the law of faith. We conclude then, that a man is justified by faith, without the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is God the God of the Jews only, and not also of the Gentiles? Surely of the Gentiles also: Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>and the uncircumcision through the same faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What shall we say then? That our father Abraham hath found according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory: but he hath not in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>So David also describeth the happiness of the man, to whom God imputeth righteousness without works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Happy are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Happy is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Cometh this happiness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was imputed to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How was it then imputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all who believe in uncircumcision, that righteousness may be imputed to them also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And the father of the circumcision, to them who not only are of the circumcision, but also walk in the footsteps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his seed by the law, but by the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be of grace, that the promise might be firm to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, (As it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>I have made thee a father of many nations) before God in whom he believed, as quickning the dead, and calling the things that are not, as though they were:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who against hope believed in hope, that he should be the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, being about an hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And being fully assured, that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written on his account only, that it was imputed to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>But on ours also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>By whom also we have been introduced through faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>knowing that tribulation worketh patience, And patience experience, and experience hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope shameth us not, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Now one will scarce die for a just man: yet perhaps for the good man one would even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God recommendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved through his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we also glory in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, even so death passed upon all men, in that all had sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed, where there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>Yet not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if by the offence of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, that of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as the loss by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the sentence was by one offence to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if through one man's offence death reigned by one, they who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness, shall much more reign in life, by one, even Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>As therefore by one offence the sentence of death came upon all men to condemnation, so also by one righteousness the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were constituted sinners, so by the obedience of one, many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But the law came in between, that the offence might abound: yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>That as sin had reigned through death, so grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? We will continue in sin that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>God forbid. How shall we who are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Know ye not, that as many of us have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we might no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>And we believe, that if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For in that he died, he died to sin once for all; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So reckon ye also yourselves to be dead to sin, and alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in the desires thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members to sin, as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members to God, as instruments of righteousness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey? Whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were the servants of sin, ye have now obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>Being then set free from sin, ye are become the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak as a man, because of the weakness of your flesh. As ye have presented your members servants to uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity, so now present your members servants of righteousness, unto holiness.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Therefore if she marry another man while her husband liveth, she will be called an adultress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law, so as to be no adultress, though she marry another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Thus ye also, my brethren, are dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye might be married to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, sinful passions, which were by the law, wrought in our members, so as to bring forth fruit unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we are freed from the law, that whereby we were held being dead, so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? That the law is sin? God forbid. Yea, I should not have known sin, but for the law. I had not known lust, unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire: for without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>sin revived, and I died, And the commandment, which was intended for life, this I found unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid: But sin: so that it appeared sin, working death in me by that which is good: so that sin might by the commandment become exceeding sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do I approve not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If then I do what I would not, I consent to the law, that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good, I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God, after the inward man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and captivating me to the law of sin, which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>Therefore there is now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath freed me from the law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God hath done: sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, to be a sacrifice for sin, he hath condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>They that are after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>Now to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>So then they who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>Now if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, will also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by him who subjected it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>In hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that the whole creation groaneth together and travaileth together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, how doth he yet hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we see not, we patiently wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit: for he maketh intercession for the saints, according to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is also at the right-hand of God, who likewise maketh intercession for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>Nay, in all these things we more than conquer, through him who hath loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Sion, and shall turn away iniquity from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>With regard to the gospel, they are enemies for your sake; but as for the election, they are beloved, for the sake of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>As then ye were once disobedient to God, but have now obtained mercy through their disobedience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>So these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they may likewise find mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God hath shut up all together in disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be repaid him again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory for ever! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I exhort you therefore, brethren, by the tender mercies of God, to present your bodies unto God, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable, which is your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>And I say, through the grace which is given to me, to every one that is among you, not to think of himself above what he ought to think, but to think soberly, according to the measure of faith which God hath distributed to every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as in one body we are many members, and all members have not the same office,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>So we being many are one body in Christ, and every one members of each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given us, whether it be prophesy, let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>Or ministry, let us wait on our ministring; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>He that imparteth, let him do it with simplicity; he that presideth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with chearfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>In brotherly love be full of tender affection toward each other, in honour preferring one another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>Not slothful in business, servent in spirit, serving the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue instant in prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Communicate to the necessities of the saints, pursue hospitality, Bless them who persecute you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>bless and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Agree in the same affection toward each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Mind not high, but condescend to low things. Be not wise in your own conceit. Render to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Dearly beloved, revenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore if thy enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to the supreme powers, for there is no power but from God; the powers that be, are appointed by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the appointment of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wouldest thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from it; for he is the servant of God to thee for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>But if thou dost that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the servant of God, an avenger for wrath against him that doth evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For this cause ye pay tribute also: for they are the ministers of God, attending continually on this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to all their due: tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man any thing, but to love another; for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love worketh no evil to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And do this, knowing the season, that it is high time now to awake out of sleep; for salvation is nearer to us now, then when we first believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far spent; the day is at hand, let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk decently, as in the day; not in banqueting and drunken entertainments, not in uncleannesses and wantonness, not in strife and envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the desires thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Him that is weak in the faith, receive; but not to doubtful disputations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For one believeth, that he may eat all things; another who is weak, eateth herbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art thou that judgest another's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be upheld; for God is able to establish him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike; let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord; for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself. But if we live, we live unto the Lord; and if we die, we die unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>Whether therefore we live or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ both died and lived again, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us therefore no longer judge one another; but judge this rather, not to lay a stumbling block, or a scandal before a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and am assured by the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that accounteth any thing to be unclean, it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if thy brother is grieved by thy meat, thou no longer walkest charitably. Destroy not him by thy meat, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Therefore let not your good be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>And he that in these serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Let us therefore pursue the things that tend to peace, and to mutual edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure: but it is evil to that man who eateth with offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good, not to eat flesh, neither to drink wine, nor to do any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or made weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because it is not of faith; for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>Therefore we who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Let every one of us please his neighbour, for his good, to edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our instruction, that we, through patience and consolation of the scriptures, may have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now the God of patience and consolation give you to think the same thing, according to Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also hath received you, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now I say, Christ Jesus was a servant of the circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud him, all ye people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaiah faith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and one arising to rule over the Gentiles: in him shall the Gentiles hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye likewise are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge, and able to admonish one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly to you, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given to me of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>That I should be the servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministring the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have therefore whereof to glory, through Jesus Christ, in the things pertaining to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not dare to speak of any thing which Christ hath not done by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, Through mighty signs and wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>by the power of the Spirit, so that I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ, from Jerusalem round about, as far as Illyricum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>But I have striven, so to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>But as it is written, They to whom he was not spoken of shall see; and they that have not heard, shall understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>Therefore I have been long hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no longer place in these parts, and having had a great desire for many years to come to you, Whenever I go into Spain, I will come to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>for I hope to see you as I pass by, and to be brought forward by you in my way thither, if first I may be somewhat satisfied with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But I am now going to Jerusalem, serving the saints. For it hath</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a collection for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>It hath pleased them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have partook of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in carnal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>When therefore I have performed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>in your prayers to God for me, That I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service at Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.32'>That I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.</verse>
