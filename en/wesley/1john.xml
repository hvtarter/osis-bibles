      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have beheld, and our hands have handled of the word of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>For the life was manifested, and we have seen, and testify and declare to you the eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message which we have heard of him and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say, we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful, and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say, we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My beloved children, I write these things to you, that ye may not sin. But if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous, And he is the propitiation for our sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He that faith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoso keepeth his word, verily in him the love of God is perfected: hereby we know that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but the old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, I do write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is past away, and the true light now shineth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He that saith, he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I have written to you, beloved children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: if any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world passeth away, and the desire thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist cometh, so even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But ye have an anointing from the Holy one, and know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you, because ye know not the truth; but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is that liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Whosoever denieth the Son, he hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Therefore let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning: if that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise which he hath promised us, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any should teach you, save as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, beloved children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If ye know, that he is righteous, ye know that every one who doth righteousness is born of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth, seeth him not, neither knoweth him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Beloved children, let no one deceive you. He that practiseth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning: to this end the son of God was manifested, to destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed abideth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>Hereby the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil: whosoever practiseth not righteousness is not of God; neither he that loveth not his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know, that we are passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murtherer, and ye know that no murtherer hath eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My beloved children, let us love not in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>Hereby ye know the spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>And every spirit which confesseth not Jesus Christ come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and now already it is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>Ye are of God, beloved children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God; he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>Hereby was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son, a propitiation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>Hereby we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and testify, that the Father sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whosoever shall confess, that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And we know and believe the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that abideth in love, abideth in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>Hereby is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and every one who loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For whosoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is he that came by water and blood; even Jesus Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood: and it is the Spirit who testifieth; because the Spirit is truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three that testify on earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and these three agree in one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>And there are three that testify in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; and this is the testimony of God, which he hath testified of his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself. He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the testimony which he hath testified of his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the testimony, that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any one see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, let him ask, and he will give him life for them that sin not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for that. All unrighteousness is sin: but there is a sin not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>but he that is born of God keepeth himself, and the wicked one toucheth him not. We know, that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>But we know that the Son of God is come; and he hath given us an understanding that we may know the true one; and we are in the true one, even in his Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Beloved children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</verse>
