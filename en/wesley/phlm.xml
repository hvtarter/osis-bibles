      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timotheus a brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-labourer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to the beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church which is in thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, (Hearing of thy faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>and love</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>toward all saints) That the communication of thy faith may become effectual, by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ, to enjoin thee what is convenient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet out of love I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also the prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, Who was formerly unprofitable to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>but now profitable to thee and me, Whom I have sent again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>thou therefore receive him, that is my own bowels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, to serve me in thy stead, in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I would do nothing without thy consent; that thy good deed might not be, as it were, by constraint, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>And perhaps for this end was he separated for a season, that thou mightest have him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>No longer as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me; and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If therefore thou accountest me a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written with my own hand; I will repay it; not to say unto thee, that thou owest also thyself to me besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence of thy obedience I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>Withal prepare me also a lodging; for I trust I shall be given to you through your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus saluteth you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-labourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
