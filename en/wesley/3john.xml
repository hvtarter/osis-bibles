      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder unto the well-beloved Caius, whom I truly love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I wish above all things, that thou mayst prosper and be in health, as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came, and testified of the truth that is in thee, as thou walkest in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, thou dost faithfully whatsoever thou dost to the brethren and to strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Who have testified of thy love before the church; whom if thou send forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For they went forth for his sake, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We ought therefore to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote to the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Wherefore if I come I will remember his wicked deeds which he doth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that is a doer of good is of God, but he that is a doer of evil, hath not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius hath a good testimony from all men, and from the truth itself: yea, we also bear testimony, and ye know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write; but I will not write to thee with ink and pen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I trust to see thee shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
