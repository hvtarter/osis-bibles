      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'> The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'> And he said: Jehovah will roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem. And the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall dry up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for they have threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'> But I will send a fire against the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'> I will also break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant of the Valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden. And the people of Syria shall go captive to Kir, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for they deported as exiles to deliver up a complete population to Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'> But I will send a fire against the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'> And I will cut off Ashdod's dwellers and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; and I will turn My hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for they delivered up as exiles a complete population to Edom and did not remember the covenant of brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'> But I will send a fire against the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour its palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for he pursued his brother with the sword, and corrupted his compassions, and his anger tore continually, and he kept it, his wrath, forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'> But I will send a fire against Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, to make their border larger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'> But I will kindle a fire against the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour its palaces, with a war cry in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the windstorm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'> And their king shall go into captivity, he and his rulers together, says Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'> But I will send a fire against Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth. And Moab shall die with uproar, with a war cry, with the sound of the ram's horn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'> And I will cut off the judge in its midst, and I will kill all his rulers with him, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn back from it; for they despised the law of Jehovah, and they have not kept His statutes. And their lies after which their fathers walked led them astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'> And I shall send a fire against Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'> So says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn back from it, for they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'> panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the helpless, and turning aside the way of the humble. And a man and his father will go in to the same girl, in order to profane the name of My holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'> And they will stretch out beside every altar, and on garments taken in pledge. And they will drink wine of those being fined in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'> Yet I destroyed the Amorite from before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the great trees. And I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from below.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'> Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you in the wilderness forty years, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'> And I raised up from your sons for prophets, and for Nazarites from your young men. Is this not even so, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'> But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and you commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart full with produce is pressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'> And refuge shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his power, nor shall the mighty deliver his life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'> and he who handles the bow shall not stand, and he swift footed shall not save, and the horse rider shall not save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'> And the stouthearted among the mighty shall run away naked in that day, declares Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'> Hear this word that Jehovah has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against all the family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'> You only have I known of all the families of the earth. On account of this, I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'> Will two walk together unless they are agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'> Will a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'> Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground, and there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and nothing at all be caught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'> If a ram's horn is blowing in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is a calamity in a city, has Jehovah not even done it ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'> For the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'> A lion has roared. Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken, who will not prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'> Make it heard at the palaces in Ashdod, and at the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see many panics in its midst, and oppressions in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'> For they do not know to do right, declares Jehovah, those who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'> So the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy! And he shall be all around the land. And he shall bring you down from your fortress, and your palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'> So says Jehovah, As the shepherd takes two legs out of the mouth of the lion, or a piece of an ear, so shall the sons of Israel be taken out, those who dwell in Samaria in a corner of a bed, and in Damascus on a couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'> Hear and testify in the house of Jacob, declares the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'> For in the day I visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit on the altars of Bethel. And the horns of the altar will be cut off and will fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'> And I will strike the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall be swept away, declares Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'> Hear this word, cows of Bashan who are in the mountain of Samaria, who press down the helpless, who crush the poor, who say to their husbands, Bring in, that we may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'> The Lord Jehovah has sworn by His holiness that the days are coming that He will lift you up with meat hooks, and the last of you with fishhooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'> And you shall go out at the breaches, each woman before her. And you shall throw down the high place, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'> Come into Bethel and transgress; multiply transgressing at Gilgal. And bring our sacrifices for the morning, your tithes for three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'> and offer a sacrifice of a thanksgiving offering that is leavened. And cry out, call out the voluntary offerings! For so you love to do , sons of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in your places; and you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'> And I have also withheld the rain from you when it was yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One piece was rained on, and the piece where it did not rain was dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'> So two or three cities staggered to one city in order to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'> I have struck you with blasting and mildew. The multitude of your gardens and your vineyards, and your figs, and your olives are devoured by the creeping locust; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'> I have sent a plague among you in the way of Egypt; I have killed your young men with the sword and your horses with captivity. And I have made the stench of your camps to come up even into your nostrils; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'> I have overthrown among you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were like a firebrand plucked out of the burning; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'> So I will do this to you, O Israel: Because of this I will do to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'> For, behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind and declares to man what His thought is , He who makes the dawn darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, Jehovah, the God of Hosts, is His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'> Hear this word which I am lifting up against you, a dirge, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'> The virgin of Israel has fallen, and will not arise again; she lies forsaken on her land; there is no one raising her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'> For so says the Lord Jehovah: The city that goes out by a thousand shall have a hundred left. And that which goes out by a hundred shall have ten left in the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'> For so says Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek Me, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'> But do not seek Bethel, and do not enter Gilgal, and do not cross over to Beersheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, and Bethel shall be for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'> Seek Jehovah, and live, that He not break out like a fire on the house of Joseph, and consume, and no one is putting it out for Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'> He abandoned those who turn justice and righteousness into wormwood on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'> He who created the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the deep darkness into the morning, and He darkened the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth, Jehovah is His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'> who flashes out with destruction on the strong; yea, destruction comes on the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'> They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they despise him who speaks uprightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'> So, because of your trampling on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him. You have built houses of hewn stones, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'> For I know your many transgressions, and your many sins: afflicting the just, taking of a bribe, and turning aside the poor in the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'> So the understanding ones shall keep silent in that time, for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'> Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so Jehovah the God of hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'> Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah the God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'> So Jehovah, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says this: Wailing shall be in all streets, and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the farmer to the mourning, and those knowing wailing to lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'> And wailing shall be in all vineyards, for I will pass among you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'> Woe to those desiring the day of Jehovah! What is this for you? The day of Jehovah is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>  It is as if a man fled before a lion, and the bear met him. Or he goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, and a snake bites him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>  Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light; even very dark, and not any brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'> I hate, I despise your feast days; and I will not delight in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'> Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not be pleased; nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'> Take away from Me the noise of your songs; and I will not hear the melody of your stringed instruments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'> But let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'> Have you brought near sacrifices and food offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'> Yea, you have carried the booth of your king, and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'> And I will cause you to go into exile beyond Damascus, says Jehovah, the God of hosts is His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'> Woe to those at ease in Zion, and those trusting in the mountain of Samaria, those noted as the leader of the nations! And the house of Israel came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'> Cross to Calneh and see; and from there go to the great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, or their border than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'> You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'> who lie on beds of ivory and stretch themselves on their couches; and those eating the lambs from the flock, and bull calves from the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'> those chanting with the mouth of the harp; they invent instruments of song for themselves like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'> who drink bowls of wine, and they anoint with the best of oils; but they are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'> So now they shall go into exile with the first of the exiles, and the feast of those who stretch themselves shall cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'> The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, declares Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces; and I will shut up the city and its fullness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'> And it shall be, if ten men remain in one house, then they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'> And his uncle shall lift him up, and he who burns him, to bring out the bones from the house; and he shall say to that one left in the recesses of the house, Are any  still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Hush! For not one shall mention the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'> For, behold, Jehovah commands, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house into cracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'> Shall horses run on the rock? Or will one plow there with oxen? For you have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'> those rejoicing for nothing, those saying, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'> For, behold, I will raise a nation up against you, O house of Israel, declares Jehovah, the God of hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the torrent of the Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'> The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And, behold, He is forming locusts at the beginning of the coming up of the late grass; even behold, the late grass after the mowings of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'> And it happened when it had made an end of eating the vegetation of the land, then I said, Lord Jehovah, I beg You, forgive. How can Jacob stand? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'> Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'> The Lord Jehovah made me to see this: And, behold, the Lord Jehovah was calling to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and it was devouring part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'> Then I said, Lord Jehovah, I beg You, stop. How can Jacob stand? For he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'> Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'> He made me see this: And, behold, the Lord was standing by the plumb line wall, and a plumb line in His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'> And Jehovah said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. And the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'> And the high places of Isaac shall be desolated, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'> Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, the king of Israel, saying, has plotted against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'> For so says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely go into exile out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'> And Amaziah said to Amos, Seer, go! Flee for yourself into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'> But do not again prophesy at Bethel any more, for it is the king's holy place, and it is the royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'> Then answered and said to Amaziah: I was not a prophet, nor was I a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a gatherer from sycamore trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'> And Jehovah took me from behind the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'> Now, then, hear the word of Jehovah: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop words against the house of Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'> So Jehovah says this: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a line. And you shall die in a defiled land. And Israel shall surely go into exile from his land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'> The Lord Jehovah made me see this: And, behold, a basket of summer fruit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'> And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. And Jehovah said to me, The end has come on My people Israel; I will not again pass over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'> And they will howl the songs of the temple in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. The dead bodies shall be many; in every place one shall throw them out, saying , Hush!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'> Hear this, you who swallow up the poor, even to make the humble of the land to cease,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.5'> saying, When will the new moon have passed, so that we may buy grain? Or the sabbath, so that we may open the wheat, making smaller the ephah, and to enlarge the shekel, and to falsify the deceitful balances,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.1'> I saw the Lord standing by the altar. And He said, Strike the capital of the door, and the thresholds will shake; and break them on the head of all of them.

        <verse osisID='Amos.9.2'> And if they dig through into Sheol, from there My hand will take them. And if they go up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.3'> And if they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there. And if they hide from My eyes in the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and he will bite them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.4'> And if they go into exile before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. And I will set My eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.5'> And the Lord Jehovah of hosts is He who touches the earth so that it melts, and all dwelling in it shall mourn. And all of it will rise up like the Nile, and sink down like the Nile of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.6'>  It is He who builds His staircase in the heavens, and He has founded His binding heavens on the earth; He who calls for the seawater and pours them out on the face of the earth, Jehovah is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.7'> Are you not like the sons of the Ethiopians to Me, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah. Have I not brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.9.8'> Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth; only that I will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, declares Jehovah.</verse>
