      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'> There was a man in the land of Uz, his name was Job. And this man was perfect and upright, and fearing God, and turning away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'> And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'> And his possessions were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household, so that this man was greater than all the sons of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'> And his sons feasted in the house of each one on his day. And they sent and called their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'> And it happened, when the day of feasting had gone around, would send and sanctify them. And he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt sacrifices according to all their number. For said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. This always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'> And a day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah. And Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'> And Jehovah said to Satan, From where have you come? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant because there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'> And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does fear God for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'> Have You not made a hedge for him, and for his house, and for all that is his all around? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'> But put out Your hand now, and touch against all that is his, and see if he will not then curse You to Your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'> And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that is his is in your hand! Only, do not lay your hand on him. And Satan went out from the face of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'> And a day came when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their brother's house, the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'> And a messenger came to and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses were feeding beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'> And the Sabeans fell on , and took them away. And they killed the young men with the edge of the sword; and I, I alone have escaped to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>  While this one was still speaking, this other also came and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the young men. And it has destroyed them; and I, I alone have escaped to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>  While this one was still speaking, this other also came and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands and swooped down on the camels. And they have taken them away. And they have killed the young men with the edge of the sword; and I, I alone have escaped to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>  While this one was still speaking, this other came and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'> And, behold! A great wind came from the wilderness and touched the four corners of the house. And it fell on the young men and they died; and I, I alone have escaped to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'> And rose up and tore his robe, and shaved his head. And he fell down on the ground and worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'> And he said, I came naked out of my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. Jehovah gave, and Jehovah has taken away. Blessed be the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'> In all this did not sin, nor charge wrong to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'> And it happened that a day came when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah. And Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'> And Jehovah said to Satan, From where have you come? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'> And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, fearing God, and turning away from evil? And he is still holding to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to swallow him for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'> And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin. Yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'> But indeed put out Your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'> And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, He is in your hand; but preserve his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'> And Satan went out from before the face of Jehovah. And he struck with bad burning ulcers from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'> And he took a broken piece of pottery with which to scrape himself. And he sat down among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'> And his wife said to him, Are you still holding fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'> But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. Also, shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'> And three friends of heard of all this evil that had come on him. And they each one came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite; Bildad the Shuhite; and Zophar the Naamathite. And they had met together to come to lament with him, and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'> And when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice and wept then. And each one tore his robe. And they sprinkled dust on their heads toward the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'> And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights. And no one was speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'> After this opened his mouth and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'> And answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'> Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night which said, A man-child has been conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'> Let that day be darkness! Let not God look on it from above, nor let the light shine on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'> Let darkness and the shadow of death seize upon it. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that blackens the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'> As for that night, let darkness seize it! Let it not be joined to the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'> Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'> Let those curse it who curse the day, those ready to stir up Leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'> Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none, let it wait for eyelids of the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'> For it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb; nor did it hide toil from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'> Why did I not die from the womb, come from the womb and expire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'> Why did the knees go before me; or why the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'> For now I would have lain down and have been quiet; I would have slept. Then I would have been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'> with kings and wise men of the earth, who built ruins for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'> or with chiefs; they had gold, they filled their houses with silver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'> or as a hidden miscarriage, I would not have been, like infants who never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'> There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'> The prisoners are at ease together, they hear not the voice of the slave driver;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'> the small and the great, he is there, and the slave free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'> Why is light given to the miserable one, and life to him who is bitter in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'> who is waiting for death, but it is not; and they dig for it more than for treasures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'> They are rejoicing to exultation. They are glad when they find the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'> To a man whose way is hidden, God has made a hedge about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'> For my sighing comes before my food; and my groanings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'> For the dreadful thing I dreaded has come on me; and that which I feared has come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'> I am not at ease, nor am I at rest; nor am I quiet; yet turmoil comes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'> And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'> Shall one try a word with you, you who are weary? But who can hold back with words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'> Behold, you have instructed many; and you have made weak hands strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'> Your words have upheld him who was falling, and you have made feeble knees strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'> But now it has come upon you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>  Is not your reverence your hope; your hope the uprightness of your ways?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'> I beg you, remember, Who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'> As I have seen, the ones who plow iniquity and sow misery reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'> They perish from the breath of God, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'> The lion roars; and the voice of the lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'> the old lion is perishing for lack of prey; and the lioness' offspring are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'> Now a word was stolen to me, and my ear received a whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'> fear and trembling met me, and made my many bones dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'> it stood still, but I could not discern its form; an image was before my eyes; there was silence; then I heard a voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'> Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'> Behold, He puts no trust in His servants; and He charges His angels with folly!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'> How much more those that dwell in houses of clay; whose foundation is in the dust; they crush them before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'> They are shattered from morning till evening; they perish forever with no one regarding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'> Is not their tent cord pulled up within them? They die, but not with wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'> Call now. Is there anyone answering you? And to which of the saints will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'> For vexation kills the fool, and passion puts to death the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'> I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'> His sons are far from safety; yea, they are crushed in the gate; nor is there any deliverer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'> The hungry eat his harvest, and take him to the thorns, and the snare snuffs up their wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'> For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring up out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'> for man is born to trouble, and the sons of the flame rise, flying upward .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'> Truly, I would seek to God, and to God I would put my plea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>  who is doing great things, and there is no searching them ; marvelous things to which is no numbering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'> giving rain on the face of the earth and sending water on the face of the field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'> to set the lowly on high; yea, the mourners become very high in safety;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'> breaking the plots of the crafty, nor did their hands perform the undertaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>  He takes the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the wily ones is hastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'> They meet with darkness by day, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'> But He saves the needy from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'> And there is hope for the weak; and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'> Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects; and despise not the chastisement of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'> For He wounds, and He binds up. He shatters, and His hands heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'> He will deliver you in six troubles; yea, in seven no evil shall touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'> In famine He will redeem you from death; and in war from the hand of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'> You shall be hidden from the whip of the tongue; and you shall not be afraid of violence when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'> You shall laugh at violence and at famine; and you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'> For you shall be in covenant with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'> And you shall know that your tent is in peace; and you shall visit your home and shall miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'> And you shall know that your seed will be numerous, and your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'> You shall come to the grave in full vigor, like a stack of grain comes up in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'> Consider this. We have searched it out; it is so. Hear it, and know it for yourself.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'> And answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'> Oh that my vexation were carefully weighed, and my ruin lifted in the balances together!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; on account of this my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; their fury is drinking my spirit; the terrors of God are set against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'> Does the wild ass bray over tender grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'> Are tasteless things eaten without salt? Or is there taste in the slime of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'> My soul refuses to touch them; they are sickening food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'> Who will give it that my desire might come, and God would grant my longing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'> and God would be willing and crush me; let loose His hand and cut me off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'> And it is yet my comfort; and I would exult in pain not spared; for I have not hidden the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'> What is my strength that I should wait? And what is my end that I should prolong my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>  Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>  Is not my help within me? And is wisdom driven from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'> To the faint, mercy is due from his friend; for he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'> My brothers have dealt deceitfully, like the torrent; like the streams of torrents, they vanish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'> those darkened from ice, in which the snow hides itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'> At the time they are warmed, they are cut off; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'> The paths of their way bend; they go to nothing, and are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'> The troops of Tema looked; the travelers of Sheba hoped for them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'> Or, Deliver me from a foe's hand? Or, Redeem me from the oppressors hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'> Teach me, and I will be silent; and cause me to understand in what I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'> Right words are powerful, but what does your arguing argue?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'> Do you intend to criticize words, and the speeches of one who is hopeless, that are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'> Yea, you cause even an orphan to fall; and you bargain over your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'> And now, please look on me. For if I lie, it is before your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'> Turn back, I beseech you; let there be no wrong. Yea, return again, for my righteousness is in it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>  Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'> As a servant pants for the shade, and as a hireling looks for his wages,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are ended without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'> Remember that my life is a breath; my eyes shall not return to see good.</verse>
