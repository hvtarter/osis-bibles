  <div type='book' osisID='1Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'> Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ according to a command of God our Savior, even the Lord Jesus Christ, our Hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'> to Timothy, a true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'> Even as I called on you to remain in Ephesus, (I going to Macedonia), that you might charge some not to teach other doctrines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'> nor to give heed to fables and to endless genealogies, which occasion doubts, rather than a stewardship of God in faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'> but the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith not pretended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'> from which having missed the mark, some turned aside to empty talking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'> wishing to be teachers of law, neither understanding what they say, nor about that which they confidently affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'> And we know that the Law is good, if anyone uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'> knowing this, that law is not laid down for a righteous one, but for lawless and undisciplined ones, for ungodly and sinful ones, for unholy and profane ones, for slayers of fathers and slayers of mothers, for murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'> for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and if any other thing opposes sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'> according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I was entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'> And I have thanks to Him empowering me, our Lord Jesus Christ, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'> the one who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent; but I received mercy, because being ignorant I did it in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>  But the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'> Faithful is the Word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'> But for this reason I received mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for an example to those being about to believe on Him to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'> Now to the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'> This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies going before as to you, that you might war the good warfare by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'> having faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away, made shipwreck concerning the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, that they may be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'> First of all then, I exhort that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'> for kings and all the ones being in high position, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet existence in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'> For this is good and acceptable before God our deliverer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'> who desires all men to be delivered and to come to a full knowledge of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'> For God is one, also there is one Mediator of God and of men, the Man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'> the One having given Himself a ransom on behalf of all, the testimony to be given in its own times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'> to which I was appointed a herald and apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie), a teacher of the nations, in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'> Therefore, I desire the men to pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'> So also the women to adorn themselves in proper clothing, with modesty and sensibleness, not with plaiting, or gold, or pearls, or expensive garments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'> but what becomes women professing fear of God, through good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'> Let a woman learn in silence, in all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'> And I do not allow a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'> For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived has come to be in transgression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'> but she will be kept safe through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with sensibleness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'> Faithful is the Word: If anyone reaches out to overseership, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'> Then it behooves the overseer to be blameless, husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, well-ordered, hospitable, apt at teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'> not a drinker, not a contentious one, not greedy of ill gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not loving money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'> ruling his own house well, having children in subjection with all respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'> But if anyone does not know to rule his own house, how will he care for a church of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>  He should not be a novice, lest being puffed up he may fall into the Devil's judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'> But he must also have a good witness from those outside, that he not fall into reproach and into a snare of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'> Likewise, deacons to be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy of ill gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'> having the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'> And also let these be tested first, then let them serve, being without reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'> Likewise, their wives to be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'> Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their own households and children well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'> For those having served well gain a good grade for themselves and much boldness in faith, those in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'> I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'> But if I delay, that you may know how to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'> And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in flesh, was justified in Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'> But the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, cleaving to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'> in lying speakers in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'> forbidding to marry, saying to abstain from foods, which God created for partaking with thanksgiving by the believers and those knowing the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'> Because every creature of God is good, and nothing to be thrust away, but having been received with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'> for through God's Word and prayerful intercourse, it is sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'> Having suggested these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, having been nourished by the words of faith, and by the good doctrine which you have followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'> But refuse the profane and old-womanish tales. And exercise yourself to godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'> For bodily exercise is profitable to a little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the present life and of that coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'> Faithful is the Word and worthy of all acceptance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'> for to this we also labor and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is deliverer of all men, especially of believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'> Enjoin and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'> Let no one despise your youth, but become an example of the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'> Until I come, attend to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'> Do not be neglectful of the gift in you, which was given to you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the elderhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'> Give care to these things; be in these things in order that your progress may be plain in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'> Give attention to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them, for doing this, you will both deliver yourself and those hearing you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'> Do not sharply rebuke an elder, but exhort as a father; and younger ones as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'> older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'> Honor widows, the ones really being widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'> But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to be godly to their own house and to make a return payment to their forebears, for this is good and pleasing before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'> But honor the one being really a widow, even having been left alone, who has set her hope on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'> But she who lives in self-pleasure has died while living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'> And enjoin these things that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'> But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially his family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'> Let a widow be enrolled having become not less than sixty years, the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'> being witnessed by good works, if she brought up children, if she hosted strangers, if she washed the feet of the saints, if she relieved afflicted ones, if she followed after every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'> But refuse younger widows; for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'> having guilt because they set aside the first faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'> and with it all, they also learn to be idle, going around the houses, and not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking the things not proper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'> Therefore, I desire the young women to marry, to bear children, to rule the house, giving no occasion to the adversary on account of reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'> For some already have turned aside behind Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'> If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them , and do not burden the church, that it may relieve those being really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'> Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those laboring in word and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'> For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox treading out grain," and, the laborer is worthy of his pay. Deut. 25:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'> Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless on " the testimony of " "two or three witnesses." Deut. 19:15</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'> The ones sinning before all, rebuke, that the rest also may have fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'> I solemnly witness before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that you should guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'> Lay hands quickly on no one, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'> No longer drink water, but use a little wine on account of your stomach and your frequent infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'> The sins of some men are plain before, going before to judgment, but indeed some follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'> Likewise, also the good works are plain beforehand, and those otherwise cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'> Let as many as are slaves under a yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name and teaching of God may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'> And those having believing masters, let them not despise them , because they are brothers, but rather let them serve as slaves, because they are believing and beloved ones, those receiving of the good service in return. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'> If anyone teaches differently, and does not consent to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrine according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'> he has been puffed up, understanding nothing, but is sick concerning doubts and arguments, out of which comes envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'> meddling, of men whose mind has been corrupted and deprived of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness. Withdraw from such persons .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'> But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'> For we have brought nothing into the world, and it is plain that neither can we carry anything out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'> But having food and clothing, we will be satisfied with these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'> But those having purposed to be rich fall into temptation, and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'> For the love of money is a root of all evils, by means of which some having lusted after it were seduced from the faith, and they themselves pierced through by many pains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'> But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'> Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'> I charge you before God, He making all things alive, and Christ Jesus, He witnessing the good confession to Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'> that you keep the commandment spotless, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'> who in His own time will reveal the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'> the only One having immortality, living in light that cannot be approached, whom no one of men saw, nor can see; to whom be honor and everlasting might. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'> Charge the rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set hope on the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, He offering to us richly all things for enjoyment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'> to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to share, generous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'> treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the coming age , that they may lay hold on everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'> O Timothy, guard the Deposit, having turned away from the profane empty babblings and opposing theories of the falsely named knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'> which some having asserted have missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
