      <chapter osisID='Joel.1'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'> The word of Jehovah that was to Joel, the son of Pethuel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'> Hear this, you old men, and give ear, all you people of the land. Has this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'> Tell your sons about it, and your sons to their sons, and their sons to another generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'> What was left by the cutter, the swarming locust ate; and that left of the swarming locust, the locust larvae ate; and that left of the locust larvae, the stripping locust ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'> Awake, drunkards, and weep. And wail, all wine drinkers, over the grape must, for it is cut off from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'> For a nation has come up on my land, strong and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the jaw teeth of a lioness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'> He has laid my vine waste and has splintered my fig tree. He has stripped it, and he threw it away; its branches grow white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'> Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth over the husband of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'> The food offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'> The field is wasted; the land mourns, for the grain is wasted. The new wine is dried up, the oil tree droops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'> Be ashamed, farmers, howl, vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field has perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'> The vine is dried up and the fig tree droops, the pomegranate, and the palm tree, and the apple tree; all the trees of the field are dried up, because joy has dried up from the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'> Gird up and lament, priests. Howl, ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, ministers of my God. For the food offering and the drink offering are held back from the house of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'> Set apart a fast; call a solemn assembly; gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'> Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah is at hand. And it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'> Is not the food cut off before your eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'> The seed shrivels under their clods; the storage bins are laid waste, the granaries are broken down, for the grain has dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'> How the beasts groan! The herds of livestock are vexed, for there is no pasture for them. Even the flocks of sheep are perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'> O Jehovah, to You I will cry, for the fire has burned up the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'> The beasts of the field also cry to You, for the rivers of water are dried up, and the fire has burned up the pastures of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'> Blow a ram's horn in Zion, and shout an alarm in My holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of Jehovah approaches; it is near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'> a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread out on the mountains, a great and a strong people. There has never been the like, nor shall there ever be again to the years of many generations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'> a fire devours before it, and a flame burns behind it. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them is a desolate wilderness; yea, also there is no escape to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'> Their appearance is like horses; and as war horses, so they run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'> They shall leap like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, like the noise of flames of fire that devour the chaff, as a strong people set in order for battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'> Before their face, the people shall be pained; all faces collect heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'> They shall run as mighty ones; they shall go up the wall as men of war. And they each go on his way, and they do not change their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'> And each does not press his brother; they each go in his paths. And if they fall behind their weapon, they shall not be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'> They shall rush on the city; they shall run on the wall; they shall climb up on the houses; they shall enter in by the windows, like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'> The earth shall quake before them, the heavens shall shake. The sun and moon shall grow dark, and the stars shall gather in their light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'> And Jehovah shall give His voice before His army, for His camp is very great. For he who does His word is strong. For the day of Jehovah is very great and terrifying, and who can endure it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'> Yet even now turn to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning, declares Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'> Yea, tear your heart, and not your robes; and turn to Jehovah your God. For He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and He pities concerning the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'> Who knows if He will turn and have pity and leave a blessing behind Him, a food offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'> Blow a ram's horn in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'> Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, gather the elders, gather the children, and those who suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go out of his room, and the bride out of her room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'> Let the priests, ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar; and let them say, Have pity on Your people, O Jehovah, and do not give Your inheritance to shame, for a proverb among those of the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'> Then Jehovah will be jealous for His land and have pity on His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'> Yea, Jehovah will answer and say to His people, Behold, I will send you grain, and wine, and oil, and you shall be satisfied with it. And I will no more make you a curse among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'> But I will remove the northern army far from you, and I will drive him into a dry and desolated land with his face toward the eastern sea, and his rear toward the western sea. And his stench shall come up, and his ill odor shall come up, because he was doing great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'> Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice, for Jehovah is doing great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'> Fear not, beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness grow green, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine give their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'> Then be glad, sons of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God. For He has given to you the early rain according to righteousness, and He will cause the rain to come down for you, the early rain and the latter rain in the first month .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'> And the floors shall be full with grain, and the wine vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'> And I will restore to you the years which the swarming locust has eaten, the locust larvae, and the stripping locust, and the cutting locust, My great army which I sent among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'> And you shall eat fully and be satisfied; and you shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall not be ashamed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'> And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is no other. And My people shall not be ashamed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.28'> And it shall be afterward, I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'> And also I will pour out My Spirit on the slaves and on the slave girls in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'> And I will give signs in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and columns of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'> The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'> For it shall be, all who shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved. For salvation shall be in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, as Jehovah has said, and among the saved whom Jehovah shall call.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.3'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.1'> For, behold, in those days and in that time, when I bring again the exiles of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.2'> I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, for My people and My inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; and they shared out My land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'> And they have cast lots for My people. And they have given a boy for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, and they drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.4'> And also, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you restoring repayment to Me? And if you are repaying Me, I will turn your reward on your own head, swiftly, speedily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>  in that you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried My good treasures to your temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.6'> You have also sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you might remove them far from their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.7'> Behold, I am arousing them from the place where you have sold them, and will return your reward on your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.8'> And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off. For Jehovah has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.9'> Proclaim this among the nations: Sanctify a war; awaken the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.10'> Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.11'> Gather yourselves and come, all you nations; and gather yourselves together all around. O Jehovah, bring down Your mighty ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.12'> Let the nations be awakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat. For there I will sit to judge all the nations all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.13'> Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down, for the press is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.14'> Multitudes, multitudes in valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.15'> The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall gather in their light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.16'> And Jehovah roars from Zion, and He gives His voice from Jerusalem. And the heavens and the earth quake. But Jehovah is a refuge for His people and a fortress to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.17'> And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be a holy thing, and aliens shall no more pass through her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.18'> And it shall be in that day, the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streams of Judah shall flow with waters. And a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and it shall water the valley of Shittim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.19'> Egypt shall be a ruin, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, from violence done to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they poured out in their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.20'> But Judah will dwell forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.21'> And I will cleanse their blood which I did not cleanse. And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion.</verse>
