      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>  We announce to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we beheld, and what our hands touched, as regards the Word of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'> And the Life was revealed, and we have seen, and we bear witness, and we announce to you the everlasting Life which was with the Father, and was revealed to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'> We announce to you what we have seen, and what we have heard, that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'> And we write these things to you, that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'> And this is the message which we have heard from Him, and we announce to you: God is light, and no darkness is in Him, none!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'> If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and we walk in darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'> But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'> If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'> If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'> My little children, I write these things to you so that you do not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'> And He is the propitiation relating to our sins, and not relating to ours only, but also relating to all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'> And by this we know that we have known Him, if we keep His commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'> The one saying, I have known Him, and not keeping His commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'> But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'> The one saying to rest in Him ought so to walk himself as that One walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'> Brothers, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'> Again I write a new commandment to you which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true Light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'> The one saying to be in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'> The one loving his brother rests in the light, and no offense is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'> But the one hating his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'> Little children, I write to you because you have been forgiven your sins through His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'> Fathers, I write to you because you have known Him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you overcome the evil one. I write to you, young ones, because you have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'> Fathers, I have written to you because you have known Him from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'> Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'> because all that which is in the world: the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'> And the world is passing away, and its lust. But the one doing the will of God abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'> Young ones, it is a last hour, and as you heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, from which you know that it is a last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'> They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they were of us, they would have remained with us; but they left so that it might be revealed that they all are not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'> And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'> I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because every lie is not of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'> Who is the liar, except the one denying, saying that Jesus is not the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one denying the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'> Everyone denying the Son does not have the Father. The one confessing the Son also has the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'> Then what you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'> And this is the promise which He promised us: everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'> I wrote these things to you concerning the ones leading you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'> And the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you. But as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and as He taught you, abide in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'> And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He is revealed we may have confidence, and not be shamed from Him in His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'> If you know that He is righteous, know that everyone doing righteousness has been born of Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'> See what manner of love the Father has given us, that we may be called children of God. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'> Beloved, now we are the children of God, and it was not yet revealed what we shall be. But we know that if He is revealed, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'> And everyone having this hope on Him purifies himself even as that One is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'> Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'> And you know that He was revealed that He might take away our sins, and sin is not in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'> Everyone remaining in Him does not sin. Everyone sinning has not seen Him, nor known Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'> Little children, let no one lead you astray; the one practicing righteousness is righteous, even as that One is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'> The one practicing sin is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning. For this the Son of God was revealed, that He undo the works of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'> Everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, because His seed abides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'> By this the children of God and the children of the Devil are revealed: Everyone not practicing righteousness is not of God; also the one not loving his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'> Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'> not as Cain was of the evil one, and killed his brother. And for what did he kill him? Because his works were evil, but the things of his brother were righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'> Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'> We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers. The one not loving the brother remains in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'> Everyone hating the brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have everlasting life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'> By this we have known the love of God , because that One laid down His life for us; and on behalf of the brothers we ought to lay down our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'> Whoever has the means of life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and shuts up his bowels from him, how does the love of God abide in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'> My little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'> And in this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'> that if our heart accuses us, we know that God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'> Beloved, if our heart does not accuse us, we have confidence with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'> And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments, and we do the things pleasing before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'> And this is His commandment, that we should believe the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as He gave command to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'> And the one keeping His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He gave to us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'> By this know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'> And every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God; and this is the antichrist which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'> Little children, you are of God and have overcome them, because He in you is greater than he in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'> They are of the world; because of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'> We are of God; the one knowing God hears us. Whoever is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'> Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'> The one who does not love has not known God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'> By this the love of God was revealed in us, because His Son, the Only begotten, God has sent into the world that we might live through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'> In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be a propitiation relating to our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'> No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love having been perfected is in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'> By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because of His Spirit He has given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'> And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'> And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and the one abiding in love abides in God, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'> By this love has been perfected with us, that we have confidence in the day of judgment, that as He is, we are also in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment; and the one fearing has not been perfected in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'> We love Him because He first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'> If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one not loving his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'> And we have this commandment from Him, that the one who loves God also loves his brother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. And everyone who loves Him who begets also loves the one who has been born of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'> By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'> For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'> Because everything having been born of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory overcoming the world, our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'> Who is the one overcoming the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'> This is the One coming through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the One witnessing, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'> For there are three bearing witness in Heaven: the Father the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'> And there are three who bear witness on the earth: The Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three are to the one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; because this is the witness of God which He has witnessed about His Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'> The one believing in the Son of God has the witness in himself. The one not believing God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'> And this is the witness: that God gave us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'> The one having the Son has life. The one not having the Son of God does not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'> I wrote these things to you, the ones believing in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have everlasting life, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'> And this is the confidence we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'> And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'> If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask; and He shall give life to him, to the ones not sinning unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he should ask about that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'> We know that everyone having been born of God does not sin, but the one born of God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'> We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'> And we know that the Son of God has come, and He has given to us an understanding that we may know the true One , and we are in the true One , in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and the life everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'> Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.</verse>
