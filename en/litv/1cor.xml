      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'> Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'> to the church of God which is in Corinth, those having been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called-out saints, with all those calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'> I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'> that in everything you were enriched in Him, in all discourse and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'> even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'> so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord, Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'> who also will confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'> God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'> Now I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all say the same thing, and there be no divisions among you, but you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'> For concerning you, my brothers, it was shown to me by those of Chloe that there are strifes among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'> But I say this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'> Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'> I give thanks to God that I did not baptize one of you, except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'> that not anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'> And I also baptized the house of Stephanas. For the rest, I do not know if I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'> For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to announce the gospel, not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ be made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'> For the word of the cross is foolishness to those being lost, but to us being saved, it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'> For it has been written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will set aside the understanding of the understanding ones." Isa. 29:14</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'> Where is the wise? Where the scribe? Where the lawyer of this world? Did God not make the wisdom of this world foolish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'> For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save the ones believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'> And since Jews ask for a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'> we on the other hand preach Christ crucified (truly an offense to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'> but to the called-out ones, both to Jews and to Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'> because the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'> For you see your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, nor many powerful, not many wellborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'> But God chose the foolish things of the world that the wise might be put to shame, and God chose the weak things of the world so that He might put to shame the strong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'> And God chose the low-born of the world, and the despised, and the things that are not, so that He might bring to nothing the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'> so that no flesh might glory in His presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'> But of Him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, both righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'> so that even as it has been written, "He that glories, let him glory in" the "Lord." Jer. 9:24</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'> And when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with excellency of word or wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'> For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and Him having been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'> And my word and my preaching was not in moving words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'> that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'> But we speak wisdom among the perfect, but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, those being brought to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'> which none of the rulers of this age has known. For if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'> according as it has been written, "Eye has not seen, and ear has not heard," nor has it risen up into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those that love Him. Isa. 64:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'> But God revealed them to us by His Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'> For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of a man within him? So also no one has known the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'> But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit from God, so that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'> Which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught of the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'> But a natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to know them , because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'> But the spiritual one discerns all things, but he is discerned by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'> For "who has known the mind of the Lord?" "Who will teach Him?" But we have the mind of Christ. Isa. 40:13</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'> And, brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual ones, but as to fleshly ones, as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'> I gave you milk to drink, and not food, for you were not then able, but neither now are you yet able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'> For you are yet fleshly. For where among you is jealousy, and strife, and divisions, are you not fleshly and walk according to man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'> For when one may say, Truly I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos; are you not fleshly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'> What then is Paul? And what Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'> I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'> So as neither he planting is anything, nor he watering, but God making to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'> So he planting and he watering are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'> For we are fellow workers of God, a field of God, and you are a building of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'> According to God's grace given to me, as a wise master builder, I laid a foundation, but another builds on it . But let each one be careful how he builds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'> For no one is able to lay any other foundation beside the One having been laid, who is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'> And if anyone builds on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'> the work of each will be revealed; for the Day will make it known, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire will prove the work of each, what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'> If the work of anyone which he built remains, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'> If the work of anyone shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss; but he will be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'> Do you not know that you are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'> If anyone corrupts the sanctuary of God, God will bring that one to corruption; for the sanctuary of God is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'> Let no one deceive himself, if anyone thinks to be wise among you in this age, let him become foolish, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it has been written, "He takes the wise in their own craftiness." Job 5:13</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'> And again, " The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are worthless." LXX-Psa. 93:11; MT-Psa. 94:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'> So let no one glory in men; for all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'> and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'> Let a man think of us as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'> And the rest, it is sought among stewards that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'> But to me it is a small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a man's day. But neither do I judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'> For I know nothing of myself, but I have not been justified by this; but He judging me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'> Then do not judge anything before time, until the Lord comes, who will both shed light on the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of the hearts. And then praise will be to each one from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'> And, brothers, I transferred these things to myself and Apollos because of you, that in us you may learn not to think above what has been written, that you not be puffed up one over the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'> For who makes you to differ? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you received it , why do you boast as if you did not receive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'> You are already satisfied; you already became rich; you reigned without us (and oh that you really did reign, so that we also might reign with you!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'> For I think that God set us out last, the apostles, as appointed to death, because we became a spectacle to the world, even to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'> We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we not honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'> Until the present hour we also hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander homeless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'> and labor, working with our own hands. Being cursed, we bless; persecuted, we bear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'> defamed, we entreat. we have become as filth of the world, dirt wiped off by all until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'> I do not write these things shaming you, but warning you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'> For if you should have myriads of teachers in Christ, yet not many fathers; for I fathered you in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'> Because of this, I urge you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'> Because of this I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'> As to my not coming to you now, some were puffed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'> But if the Lord wills, I will come to you shortly. And I will not know the word of those who have been puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'> For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'> What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'> Everywhere it is heard that fornication is among you, and such fornication which is not named among the heathen, so as one to have his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'> And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that did this deed might be taken from your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'> For as being absent in body, but being present in spirit, I have already judged the one who has worked out this thing, as if I were present:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together with my spirit also, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'> to deliver such a one to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'> Your boast is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens all the lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'> Then purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For also Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'> So let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and of evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'> I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'> and not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or with plunderers, or with idolaters, since then you must go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'> But now I wrote to you not to associate intimately; if anyone is called a brother and is either a fornicator, or a covetous one, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a plunderer, with such a one not to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'> For what is it to me also to judge the ones outside? Do you not judge those inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'> But God will judge the ones outside. "And you shall put out the evil one from you." Deut. 17:7</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'> Does anyone of you having a matter against another dare to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'> Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of small judgments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'> Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to speak of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'> If, then, you truly have judgments of this life, those being least esteemed in the church, you sit these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'> For I speak shame to you. So, is there not a wise one among you, not even one who will be able to give judgment on his brother in your midst?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'> But brother is judged with brother, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'> Indeed, then, there is already a failure with you all, that you have lawsuits with yourselves. Why not instead be wronged? Why not instead be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'> But you do wrong, and defraud, and these things to brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'> Or do you not know that unjust ones will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abusers, nor homosexuals,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'> nor thieves, nor covetous ones, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor plunderers shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'> And some were these things, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'> All things are lawful to me, but not all things profit. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be ruled by any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'> Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods, but God will destroy both this and these. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'> And God both raised up the Lord, and He will raise us up through His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Then taking the members of Christ, shall I make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'> Or do you not know that he being joined to a harlot is one body? For He says, "The two shall be into one flesh." Gen. 2:24</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'> But he being joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'> Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he doing fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'> Or do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God, and you are not of yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'> You were bought with a price; then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'> But concerning what you wrote to me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'> but because of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'> Let the husband give due kindness to the wife, and likewise the wife also to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'> The wife does not have authority of her own body, but the husband. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'> Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer. And come together again on the same place , that Satan may not tempt you through your incontinence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'> But I say this by permission, not by command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'> But I desire all men also to be as myself. But each has his own gift from God, one this way, and one that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'> But I say to the unmarried men, and to the widows, it is good for them if they also remain as I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'> But if they do not have self control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be inflamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'> But I command the ones being married (not I, but the Lord), a woman not to be separated from her husband;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'> And the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you; or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'> But much rather the members of the body seeming to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'> And those of the body we think to be less honorable, to these we put more abundant honor around them . And our unpresentable members have more abundant propriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'> But our presentable members have no need. But God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member having need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'> that there not be division in the body, but that the members might have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'> And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it . If one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'> And you are Christ's body, and members in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'> And God placed some in the church: firstly apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then works of power; then gifts of healing, helps, governings, kinds of languages.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'> If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'> And if I have prophecies, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'> And if I give out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, but I do not have love, I am not profited anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'> Love has patience, is kind; love is not envious; love is not vain, is not puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'> does not behave indecently, does not pursue its own things, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'> does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>  Love quietly covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'> Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be caused to cease; if tongues, they shall cease; if knowledge, it will be caused to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'> but when the perfect thing comes, then that which is in part will be caused to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'> When I was an infant, I spoke as an infant, I thought as an infant, I reasoned as an infant. But when I became a man, I caused to cease the things of the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'> For now we see through a mirror in dimness, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will fully know even as I also was fully known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'> And now faith, hope, and love, these three things remain; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'> Pursue love, and seek eagerly the spiritual things, but rather that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'> For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God, for no one hears, but in spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'> But the one prophesying to men speaks for building up, and encouragement, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'> The one speaking in a tongue builds himself up, but he prophesying builds up a church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'> And I wish all of you to speak in languages, but rather that you may prophesy. For the one prophesying is greater than the one speaking in tongues, unless he interpret that the church may receive building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'> But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'> Yet lifeless things giving a sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the sound, how will it be known what is being piped or harped?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'> For also if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will get himself ready for war?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'> So also you, if you do not give a clear word through the language, how will it be known what is being said? For you will be speaking into air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'> So it may be many kinds of sounds are in the world, and not one is without distinct sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'> If, then, I do not know the power of the sound, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and he speaking in me a foreigner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'> So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual things, seek to build up the church that you may abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'> So then, the one speaking in a language, let him pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'> What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'> Else, if you bless in the spirit, the one occupying the place of the unlearned, how will he say the amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'> For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not built up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'> I thank my God that I speak more languages than all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'> But in a church I desire to speak five words with my mind, that I may also instruct others, than myriads of words in a foreign language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'> Brothers, do not be children in your minds, but in malice be like infants, and in your minds be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'> It has been written in the Law, "By other tongues" and "by other lips" "I will speak to this people," "and even so they will not hear" Me, says the Lord." Isa. 28:11, 12</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'> So that tongues are not a sign to those believing, but to those not believing. But prophecy is not to those not believing, but to those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'> Then if the whole church comes together, and all speak in languages, and uninstructed ones or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you rave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'> But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or one not instructed comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'> And so the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'> Then what is it, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, he has a teaching, he has a language, he has a revelation, he has an interpretation. Let all things be for building up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'> If one speaks in a language, let it be by two or three at the most, and in turn, also let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'> And if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'> And if there are two or three prophets, let them speak, and let the others discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'> But if a revelation is revealed to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'> For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'> And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'> For God is not God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'> Let your women be silent in the churches, for it is not allowed to them to speak, but to be in subjection, as also the Law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'> But if they desire to learn anything, let them question their husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in a church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'> Or did the Word of God go out from you? Or did it reach only to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'> If anyone thinks to be a prophet, or a spiritual one, let him recognize the things I write to you, that they are a command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'> But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'> So then, brothers, seek eagerly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'> And let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'> But, brothers, I reveal to you the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'> by which you also are being kept safe, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'> For I delivered to you in the first place what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'> and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'> and that He appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'> Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also fell asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'> Then He was seen by James, then by all the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'> and last of all, even as if to one born out of time, He was also seen by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'> For I am the least of the apostles, who am not sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which was toward me has not been without fruit, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'> Then whether they or I, so we preach, and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'> But if Christ is proclaimed, that He was raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is not a resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'> But if there is not a resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'> But if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is worthless, and your faith is also worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'> And also we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we witnessed as to God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if then dead ones are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'> For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'> But if Christ has not been raised, your faith is foolish; you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'> And then those that fell asleep in Christ were lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'> If we only have hope in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'> But now Christ has been raised from the dead; He became the firstfruit of those having fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'> For since death is through man, also through a Man is a resurrection of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'> for as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'> But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruit, afterward those of Christ at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'> Then is the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He makes to cease all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'> for it is right for Him to reign until He puts all the enemies under His feet; Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>  the last enemy made to cease is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'> For "He subjected all things under His feet;" but when He says that all things have been subjected, it is plain that it excepts Him who has subjected all things to Him. Psa. 8:6</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'> But when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all things in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'> Otherwise, what will they do, those being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not at all raised, why indeed are they baptized on behalf of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'> Why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'> Day by day I die, by your boasting, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'> If according to man I fought with beasts in Ephesus, what the profit to me if the dead are not raised? ("Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.") Isa. 22:13</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'> Do not be led astray; bad companionships ruin good habits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'> Be righteously awake, and do not sin; for some have ignorance of God. I speak to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'> But someone will say, How are the dead raised? And with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'> Foolish one! What you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'> And what you sow, you do not sow the body that is going to be, but a bare grain, (it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'> and God gives it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'> Not every flesh is the same flesh, but one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fish, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'> And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly is truly different, and that of the earthly different;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'> So also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'> It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'> It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'> So also it has been written, "The" first "man", Adam, "became a living soul;" the last Adam a life-giving Spirit. Gen. 2:7</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'> But not the spiritual first, but the natural; afterward the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'> The first man was out of earth, earthy. The second Man was the Lord out of Heaven. Gen. 2:7</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'> Such the earthy man , such also the earthy ones. And such the heavenly Man , such also the heavenly ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'> And as we bore the image of the earthy man , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly Man .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'> And I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'> Behold, I speak a mystery to you: we shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'> In a moment, in a glance of an eye, at the last trumpet; for a trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'> But when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then will take place the word that has been written, "Death was swallowed up in victory." Isa. 25:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'> "O death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?" Hos. 13:14</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'> Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'> but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'> So that, my beloved brothers, you be firm, immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that your labor is not without fruit in the Lord.</verse>
