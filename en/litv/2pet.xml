      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'> Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those equally precious with us, having obtained faith in the righteousness of our God and our Savior, Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'> Grace to you, and peace be multiplied by a full knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'> As His divine power has given to us all things pertaining to life and godliness through the full knowledge of the One calling us through glory and virtue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'> by which means He has given to us the very great and precious promises, so that through these you might be partakers of the divine nature, escaping from the corruption in the world by lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'> But also in this very thing, bringing in all diligence, filling in your faith with virtue; and virtue with knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'> and knowledge with self-control; and self-control with patience; and patience with godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'> and godliness with brotherly love; and brotherly love with love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'> For these things being in you, and abounding, they will make you not idle, not unfruitful in the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'> For the one in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted, taking on forgetfulness of the cleansing of his sins in time past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'> On account of this, brothers, rather be diligent to make sure of your calling and election; for doing these things, you will not ever fall into sin .</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'> For so will be richly furnished to you the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'> For this reason I will not neglect to cause you to remember always concerning these things, though you know and have been confirmed in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'> But I deem it right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'> knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'> And I will also be diligent to cause you always to have memory of these things after my departure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'> For not following fables which had been cleverly devised, but having become eyewitnesses of the majesty of Jesus Christ, we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'> For receiving honor and glory from God the Father such a voice being borne to Him from the magnificent glory, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I was well pleased," Psa. 2:7; Gen. 22:2; Isa. 42:1; Matt. 17:5</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'> even we heard this voice being borne out of Heaven, being with Him in the holy mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'> and we have the more established prophetic word, in which you do well to take heed, as to a lamp shining in a murky place, until day dawns and the Day-star rises in your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'> knowing this first, that every prophecy of Scripture did not come into being of its own interpretation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'> for prophecy was not at any time borne by the will of man, but having been borne along by the Holy Spirit, holy men of God spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'> But false prophets were also among the people, as also false teachers will be among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, and denying the Master who has bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'> And many will follow their destructive ways, by whom the way of truth will be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'> And by covetousness, with well-turned words, they will use you for gain, for whom judgment of old does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'> For if God did not spare sinning angels, but delivered them to chains of darkness, thrust down into Tartarus, having been kept to judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'> and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah the eighth, a herald of righteousness, bringing a flood on a world of ungodly ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'> and covering the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah with ashes, He condemned them with an overthrow, setting an example to men intending to live ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'> And He delivered righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the behavior of the lawless in lustfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'> For that righteous one living among them day after day, in seeing and in hearing, his righteous soul was tormented with their lawless deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>  But the Lord knows to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unjust for a day of judgment, being punished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'> and most of all those going after flesh in the lust of defilement, and despising rulership, darers, self-pleasing; they do not tremble at glories, speaking evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'> where angels being greater in strength and power do not bring against them a reproaching charge before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'> But these as unreasoning natural beasts, having been born for capture and corruption, speaking evil in that of which they are ignorant, they shall utterly perish in their corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'> being about to receive the wages of unrighteousness, having deemed indulgence in the day to be pleasure; spots and blemishes reveling in their deceits, feasting along with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'> having eyes full of an adulteress, and never ceasing from sin; alluring unsettled souls; having a heart busied with covetousness; cursed children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'> forsaking a straight path, they went astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'> but had reproof of his own transgression, the dumb ass speaking in a man's voice held back the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'> These are springs without water, clouds being driven by tempest, for whom the blackness of darkness is kept forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'> For speaking great swelling words of vanity, by the lusts of the flesh, by unbridled lusts, they allure those indeed escaping the ones living in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'> promising them freedom, though themselves being slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been overcome, even to this one he has been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'> For if by a full knowledge of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, they have escaped the defilements of the world, and again being entangled they have been overcome by these, then their last things have become worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'> For it was better for them not to have fully known the way of righteousness, than fully knowing to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'> But the word of the true proverb has happened to them: " The dog turning to his own vomit;" also, the washed sow to wallowing in mud. Prov. 26:11</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'> Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle, in which by reminder I stir up your sincere mind to remember</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'> the words having been spoken before by the holy prophets, and the command of the Lord and Savior by us, the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'> first, knowing this, that during the last days scoffers will come walking according to their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'> and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue this way from the beginning of creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'> For this is hidden from them by their willing it so , that heavens were of old, and earth by water, and through water, being held together by the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'> through which the world which then was, being flooded by water, perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'> But the heavens and the earth now, having been stored up by the same word, are being kept for fire to a day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'> But let not this one thing be hidden from you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is "as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." Psa. 90:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'> The Lord of the promise is not slow, as some deem slowness, but is long-suffering toward us, not having purposed any of us to perish, but all of us to come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with rushing sound, and having burned the elements will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'> Then all these being about to be dissolved, what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'> looking for and hastening the coming of the Day of God, through which the heavens having been set afire will be dissolved; and burning, the elements will melt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'> But according to His promise, we look for "new heavens and a new earth," in which righteousness dwells. Isa. 65:17</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'> Because of this, beloved, looking for these things, be diligent, spotless, and without blemish, to be found in peace by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'> And think of the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation, as also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom given to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'> as also in all his epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unsettled pervert, as also they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'> Then beloved, you knowing beforehand, watch lest being led away by the error of the lawless you fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'> But grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>
