        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'> The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who have known the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'> because of the truth remaining among us, and will be with us forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'> Grace, mercy, peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'> I rejoiced greatly because I found your children walking in truth, as we received command from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'> And I now request you, lady, not writing as a new commandment, but one which we had from the beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'> And this is love, that we should walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'> Because many deceivers went out into the world, those not confessing Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, this is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'> Watch yourselves, that we may not lose the things we worked out, but that we may receive a full reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'> Everyone transgressing and not abiding in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. The one abiding in the doctrine of Christ, this one has the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'> If anyone comes to you and does not bear this doctrine, do not receive him into the house, and do not speak a greeting to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'> For the one speaking a greeting shares in his evil works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'> Having many things to write to you, I do not intend to speak by means of paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'> The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</verse>
