  <div type='book' osisID='2Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'> Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'> to my beloved child Timothy: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'> I have thanks to God, whom I worship from my forebears in a pure conscience, how unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'> longing to see you, being reminded of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'> taking recollection of the unpretended faith in you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am assured that it is also in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'> For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'> For God did not give a spirit of cowardice to us, but of power and of love, and of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'> Then do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner. But suffer hardship with the gospel, according to the power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'> He having saved us and having called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'> but now revealed through the appearance of our Savior, Jesus Christ, making death of no effect, bringing life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'> for which I was appointed a herald and apostle and a teacher of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'> For which cause I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit until that Day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'> Hold a pattern of sound words which you heard from me, in faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'> Guard the good Deposit given through the Holy Spirit indwelling in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'> You know this, that all those in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'> May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me, and he was not ashamed of my chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'> but having come to Rome, he more diligently sought and found me .</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'> May the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that Day. And what things he served in Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'> Then my child, you be empowered by grace in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'> And what things you heard from me through many witnesses, commit these things to faithful men, such as will be competent also to teach others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'> Then you suffer hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'> No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, so that he might please the one enlisting him .</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'> And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>  It is right the laboring farmer to partake first of the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'> Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'> Remember Jesus Christ, having been raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'> in which I suffer ill as an evildoer, unto bonds; but the Word of God has not been bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'> Because of this, I endure all things on account of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus, with everlasting glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'> Faithful is the Word: for if we died with Him , we also shall live with Him ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'> if we endure, we shall also reign with Him ; if we deny Him , that One will deny us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'> if we are unfaithful, that One remains faithful; He is not able to deny Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'> Remind them of these things, solemnly testifying before the Lord not to dispute about words for nothing useful, to the throwing down of those hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'> Earnestly study to present yourself approved to God, a workman unashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'> But shun profane, empty babblings, for they will go on to more ungodliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'> and their word will have growth like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'> who missed the mark concerning the truth, saying the resurrection already has come, and overturn the faith of some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'> However, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal, " The Lord knew those being His;" Num. 16:5 , also, Let everyone naming the name of Christ depart from unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'> But in a great house not only are there vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor and some to dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'> Then if anyone purifies himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, having been sanctified and made useful to the Master, having been prepared to every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'> But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with the ones calling on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'> But refuse the foolish and uninstructed questionings, knowing that they generate quarrels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'> But a slave of the Lord ought not to quarrel, but to be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'> in meekness teaching those who have opposed, if perhaps God may give them repentance for a full knowledge of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'> and they may awake out of the snare of the Devil, having been taken captive by him, so as to do the will of that one.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'> But know this, that in the last days grievous times will be upon us .</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'> For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, braggarts, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'> without natural feeling, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, haters of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'> betrayers, reckless, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'> having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it; even turn away from these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'> For of these are those creeping into houses and leading silly women captive, the ones having been heaped with sins, being led away by various lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'> always learning, but never being able to come to a full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'> But in the way Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these withstand the truth, men having been corrupted in mind, found worthless as to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'> But they will not go further, for their foolishness will be plain to all, as also that of those became.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'> But you have closely followed my doctrine, the conduct, the purpose, the faith, the long-suffering, the love, the patient endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'> the persecutions, the sufferings, such as happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what persecutions I bore. And the Lord delivered me out of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'> And, indeed, all desiring to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'> But evil men and pretenders will go forward to worse, leading astray and being led astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'> But you keep on in what you learned and were assured of, knowing from whom you learned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'> and that from a babe you know the Holy Scriptures, those being able to make you wise to salvation through belief in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'> Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'> so that the man of God may be perfected, fully furnished for every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'> Then I solemnly witness before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, He being about to judge living and dead at His appearance and His kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'> preach the Word, be urgent in season, out of season, convict, warn, encourage with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'> For a time will be when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts, they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'> and they will turn away the ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'> But you be clear-minded in all, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'> For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'> I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'> For the rest, the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me in that Day, and not only to me, but also to all the ones loving His appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'> Make haste to come to me shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'> For Demas deserted me, loving the present age, and he went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'> Only Luke is with me. Taking Mark, bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'> When you come, bring the cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'> Alexander the coppersmith demonstrated many evil things to me. The Lord "will give back to him according to his works." LXX-Psa. 61:13; Prov. 24:12; MT-Psa. 62:12</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'> You also guard against him , for he greatly withstood our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'> In my first defense no one was beside me, but all deserted me. May it not be reckoned to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'> But the Lord stood with me and gave me power, that through me the preaching might be fulfilled, and all the nations might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'> And the Lord will deliver me from every wicked work and will save me for His heavenly kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'> Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'> Erastus remained in Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'> Try to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
