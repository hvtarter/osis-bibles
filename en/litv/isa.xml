      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'> The vision of the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'> Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth! For Jehovah has spoken: I have nursed and brought up sons, but they have rebelled against Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'> The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'> Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, sons who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'> Why will you be stricken any more? Will you continue the revolt? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'> From the sole of the foot even to the head, no soundness is in it; only a wound and a stripe and a fresh blow; they have not been closed, nor bound up; nor was it softened with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'> Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Foreigners devour your land before you; and behold , ruin, as overthrown by foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'> And the daughter of Zion is left a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'> Except Jehovah of hosts had left a remnant for us, a few, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'> Hear the word of Jehovah, rulers of Sodom. Listen to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'> What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I am full of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fattened cattle, and the blood of bulls; nor do I delight in the blood of lambs and he goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'> When you come to see My face, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'> Do not add to bringing vain sacrifice; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the going to meeting, and the evil assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'> My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me. I am weary of bearing them .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'> And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Yea, when you multiply prayer, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'> Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My sight; stop doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'> Learn to do good, seek justice, reprove the oppressor, judge the orphan, strive for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'> Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they are red as the crimson, they shall be like wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'> If you are willing and hear, you shall eat the good of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'> But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'> Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it. But now, murderers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'> Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'> Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and is pursuing rewards. They do not judge the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'> and says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Alas! I will be eased of My foes, and avenge Myself of My enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'> And I will return My hand on you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and take away all your alloy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'> And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisors, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'> And the ruin of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'> For they shall be ashamed of the trees which you lusted after; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'> For you shall be like a tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'> And the strong shall be for tow, and his work for a spark; and they shall burn both together; and no one shall quench them .</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'> The word that the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'> And it shall be in the last days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'> And many people shall go and say, Come and let us go up to the mount of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach from His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion the law will go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'> And He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'> Oh house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'> For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled from the east, and are fortunetellers like the Philistines. And they clap hands with children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'> And his land is filled with silver and gold. There is no end of his treasures. And his land is full of horses; his chariots also do not have an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'> And his land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'> And man bowed down; and man was humbled, but You do not lift them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'> Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from fear of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'> The lofty eyes of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be bowed down; but Jehovah, He alone, will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'> For the day of Jehovah of Hosts shall be on all the proud and lofty ones, and on all that is lifted up; and it will be abased;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'> and against all Lebanon's cedars, high and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'> and against all the high mountains; and against all the lifted up hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'> and against every tall tower; and against every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'> and against all the ships of Tarshish; and on all pleasurable craft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'> And the pride of man shall be humbled; and the loftiness of men shall be abased; and Jehovah alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'> And the idols shall completely vanish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'> And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for fear of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth quake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'> ln that day a man shall throw his silver and his golden idols which they made for him to worship, to the hole of the burrower and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'> to go into the crevices of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the dread of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth quake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'> Cease yourself from man, whose breath is in his nostril, for in what is he to be esteemed?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'> For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, takes away the stay and the staff from Jerusalem and from Judah; the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'> the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; and the diviner and the elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'> the commander of fifty and the exalted of face; the counselor and the skilled craftsman; and the expert enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'> And I will give young boys to be their rulers, and caprices shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'> And the people shall be crushed, man against man, and a man on his neighbor. The boy will be insolent against the elder, and the despised against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'> When a man shall take hold of his brother, at his father's house, saying , A cloak! Come, you be a ruler for is; let this ruin be under your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'> In that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be one who binds up; for there is no bread nor a cloak in my house; you shall not make me a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'> For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds toward Jehovah are to rebel against the eyes of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'> The look of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it . Woe to their soul! For they have dealt evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'> Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'> Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the doing of his hand will be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>  As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over him. Oh My people, your rulers cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'> Jehovah stands up to plead His cause, and stands up to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'> Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their kings. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'> What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor, says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'> And Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'> So Jehovah will make the crown of the daughter of Zion scabby; and Jehovah will lay their secret parts bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'> In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of the ankle bracelets, and the headbands, and the crescents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'> the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'> the headdresses, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'> the rings and nose jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'> the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'> the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'> And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a sash, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'> Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit bare on the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'> And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing, only let your name be called on us; collect our shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'> In that day the Branch of Jehovah will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth for pride and for glory for the survivors of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'> And it shall be, he remaining in Zion, and he who is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one who is written among the living in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'> when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and the blood of Jerusalem shall have been rinsed away from its midst by a spirit of judgment, and by a spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'> Then Jehovah will create a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, over all the site of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies; for on all the glory will be a canopy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'> And there shall be a booth for a shade from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from storm and rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'> Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard: My Beloved has a vineyard in a fruitful horn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'> And He dug it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in its midst, and also hewed out a wine vat in it. And He waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced rotten grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'> And now, O people of Jerusalem and men of Judah, I ask you, judge between Me and My vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'> What more could have been done to My vineyard that I have not done in it? Who knows? I waited for it to yield grapes, but it yielded rotten grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'> And now I will make known to you what I will do then to My vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it will be burned. I will breach its wall, and it will become a trampling ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'> And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds from raining rain on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'> For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Judah is His delightful plant. And He waited for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'> Woe to those touching house to house, bringing near field to field until the end of space, and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'> Jehovah of Hosts has sworn in my ears, If not, many houses shall be a waste, big and beautiful ones without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'> Woe to those who rise early in the morning to go after fermented drink, tarrying in the twilight while wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'> And the lyre and the harp, the timbrel and flute, and wine are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Jehovah; yea, they do not see the work of His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'> For this My people go into exile without knowledge, and his men of glory into famine; and his multitude is parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'> So Sheol has enlarged its appetite, and opened its mouth without measure, and her glory and her multitude, and her uproar, he who exults in her, shall come down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'> And man is bowed down, and man is humbled, and the eyes of the proud are humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'> But Jehovah of Hosts is exalted in judgment, and God the Holy One is proven holy in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'> Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and strangers shall eat the waste places of the fatlings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'> Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with ropes of a cart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'> who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'> Woe to those who say to evil, good; and to good, evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'> Woe to those wise in their own eyes, and discerning in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'> Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and brave men to mix fermented drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'> who justify the wicked for a bribe, and turn aside the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'> So, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and the flame burns up the chaff; their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the law of Jehovah of Hosts; and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'> On account of this the anger of Jehovah is kindled on His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has struck them; and the mountains quaked, and their dead bodies were  as filth in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'> And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will hiss to them from the ends of the earth; and, behold, it shall come with swift speed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none will slumber nor sleep; nor shall the waist cloth of their loins be opened, nor the thong of their sandals broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'> whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hooves shall appear as flint, and their wheels like a hurricane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'> Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions. Yea, they roar and seize the prey, and carry it away; and no one shall deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'> And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; when one looks to the land, and lo, darkness! Distress! And light shall be darkened by its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'> In the year that king Uzziah died, then I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up. And His train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'> Above it stood the seraphs. Each one had six wings; with two he covered his face; and with two he covered his feet; and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'> And one cried to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of Hosts; all the earth is full of His glory!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'> And the doorposts shook from the voice of the one who cried; and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'> Then I said, Woe is me! For I am cut off; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live amongst a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'> Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, snatched with tongs from the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'> And he touched it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'> And I heard the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Behold me. Send me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'> And He said, Go and tell this people, Hearing you hear, but do not understand; and seeing you see, but do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'> Make the heart of this people fat, and make his ears heavy, and shut his eyes, that he not see with his eyes, and hear with his ears, and understand with his heart, and turn back, and one heals him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'> Then I said, Until when, O Lord? And He said, Until cities lie desolate without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land is laid waste, a desolation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'> and until Jehovah has sent mankind far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'> But yet a tenth shall be in it, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak that in being felled yet has its stump (the holy seed is its stump).</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'> And it happened in the days of Ahaz: the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but were not able to do battle against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'> And the house of David was told, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim, and his heart and the heart of his people shook, as the trees of the forest shake from the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'> And Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shearjashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, to the highway of the Fuller's Field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'> And say to him, Be on guard and be calm. Do not fear nor be timid of heart because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'> Let us go up against Judah and make her to dread, and break her for ourselves, and set a king in her midst, the son of Tabeal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'> So says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not rise, nor shall it happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'> For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty five years Ephraim shall be broken from being a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you will not be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'> And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz:, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'> Ask a sign from Jehovah your God; make deep the request, or make it high above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'> But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'> And He said, Hear now, O house of David, is it too little that you weary men, but will you also weary my God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'> So, The Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold! The virgin will conceive and will bring forth a son; and she shall call His name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'> He shall eat curds and honey until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'> For before the boy shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you hate will be forsaken before both her kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'> Jehovah shall bring the king of Assyria on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days which have not come since the days Ephraim turned aside from Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'> And it shall be, in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the end of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'> And they shall come, and they shall all rest in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn bushes, and in all the pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'> In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired, Beyond the River, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and also it shall sweep away the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'> And it shall be in that day, a man shall keep alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'> And it shall be, he shall eat curds from the plenty of milk making; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat curds and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'> And it shall be in that day, every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'> With arrows and with the bow, he shall come there; because all the land shall be briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'> And all the hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending out of the ox, and for trampling of sheep.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'> And Jehovah said to me, Take a big tablet and write in it with a man's pen: Make haste to plunder! Hasten to the prey!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'> And I took faithful witnesses to record for me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'> And I drew near the prophetess. And she conceived, and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Hurry, plunder! Eagerly plunder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'> For before the boy knows to cry, My father, or, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'> Jehovah also spoke to me again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'> Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoices in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'> Behold, therefore the Lord also brings on them the channels of the River, mighty and many: the king of Assyria and all his glory. And he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'> And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over. He shall reach to the neck; and his wings will be stretching out, filling the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'> O peoples, suffer evil, and be broken! And listen, all from the far places of the earth; gird yourselves, and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'> Counsel a counsel, and it is frustrated; speak a word, and it shall not rise; for God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'> For so Jehovah spoke to me with a strong hand, and taught me against walking in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'> Do not say, A conspiracy, to everything of which this people says, A conspiracy! And do not fear its fear, and do not dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'> Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear; and let Him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'> And He shall be for a sanctuary, and for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of falling to the two houses of Israel; for a trap and for a snare to the dweller of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'> And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'> And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'> Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given to me are for signs and wonders in Israel from Jehovah of Hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'> And when they say to you, Seek to the mediums, and to wizards who peep and mutter; should not a people seek to its God, than for the living to seek to the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'> To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no dawn to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'> And they shall pass through it, hard pressed and hungry. And it shall be, they shall be hungry; he will rave and curse his king and his God, and face upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'> And they shall look to the land. And, behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish; and they are driven to darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'> Yet there shall not be gloom for which anguish is to her; as in the former time when He degraded the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, so afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'> The people who walk in darkness have seen a great light. The ones who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, light has shone on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'> You have not multiplied the nation; You have not increased the joy. They rejoice before You as in the joy of, harvest, as men shout when they divide the plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'> For You have broken his burdensome yoke and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'> For every boot of the trampler is with commotion, and a coat rolled in blood shall be burning fuel for the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'> For a Child is born; to us a Son is given; and the government is on His shoulder; and His name is called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'> There is no end to the increase of His government and of peace on the throne of David, and on His kingdom, to order it, and to sustain it with justice and with righteousness, from now and forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'> The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has fallen into Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'> And all the people shall know, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and greatness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'> Bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'> And Jehovah will set up Rezin's foes against him, and spur on his enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'> Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with all the mouth. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'> For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, and they do not seek Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'> And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'> The elder and the exalted of face; he is the head. And the prophet who teaches lies; he is the tail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'> For this people's leaders led them astray, and its guided ones are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'> For this the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor have pit on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer; and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'> For wickedness burns like a fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle the thickets of the forest; and they shall roll upward, like the going up of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'> The land is scorched by the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'> And he shall cut off on the right hand, yet be hungry. And he shall eat on the left, but not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; together they are against Judah. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.10'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'> Woe to those who decree decrees of injustice, and writers who write toil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.2'> to keep back the poor from judgment, and to steal justice from the poor of My people; that widows may be their prey; that they may rob orphans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.3'> And what will you do in the day of visitation and of destruction? It comes from far away. To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.4'> Surely, he will grovel under the prisoners, and they will fall under the slain. In all this His anger does not turn away, but His hand is still stretched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.5'> Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And My fury is the staff in their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'> I will send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to plunder, and to strip off spoil, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'> Yet he does not purpose this, nor does his heart think so. For it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.8'> For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.9'>  Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is Hamath not like Arpad? Is Samaria not like Damascus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.10'> As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols (for their carved images excelled Jerusalem's and Samaria's);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.11'> shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'> And it will be, when the Lord has broken off all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will visit on the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and on the glory of his lofty eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'> For he says, I have worked by the strength of my hand and by my wisdom; for I am wise. And I take away the borders of peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a mighty one, I subdue inhabitants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'> And my hand has found the riches of the people. Like a nest, I also have gathered all the earth, as forsaken eggs are gathered. And there was not one moving a wing, or opening a mouth, or one chirping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'> Shall the axe glorify itself over him chopping with it? Or shall the saw magnify itself over him moving it? As if a rod could wave those who lift it . As if a staff could raise what is not wood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.16'> So the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones. And under His glory He will kindle a burning like the burning of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.17'> And the Light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.18'> And He shall consume the glory of his forest and his fruitful field, even from soul to flesh; and it shall be as a sick man melts away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.19'> And the rest of the trees of the forest shall be few, so that a boy might write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.20'> And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel, and the escaped ones from the house of Jacob, shall not any more lean on him who struck him. But they will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.21'> The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.22'> For though Your people Israel is like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of it shall return; a determined end, overflowing with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.23'> For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts is making a full end, even ordained, in the midst of all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.24'> So the Lord Jehovah of Hosts says this: Oh My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with the rod, and he shall lift up his staff against you in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.25'> But yet a little while, and the fury is finished; and My anger shall be over their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.26'> And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a whip on him, according to the striking of Midian at the rock Oreb; and as His rod was on the sea, and He lifted it up in the way of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.27'> And it shall be in that day, his burden shall turn away from on your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.28'> He has come to Aiath; he has passed to Migron; he has left his baggage at Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.29'> They have crossed the ford; they have bedded down at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul has fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.30'> Shriek with your voice, daughter of ruins; bow, Laish, afflicted of Anathoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.31'> Madmenah wanders; Gebim's inhabitants take refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.32'> Yet he remains in Nob today; he will shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.33'> Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop the bough of terror! And the lofty ones shall be cut down, and the proud shall be humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.34'> And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.63.13'> He led them through the deeps; like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'> As the cattle go down into the valley, so the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest; so You led Your people, to make a glorious name for Yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'> Look down from Heaven and peer from the place of Your holiness and your glory. Where is Your zeal and Your might? The stirring of Your affections and Your mercies toward me, are they held back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.16'> For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us; You, Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'> O Jehovah, why do You make us wander from Your ways? You harden our heart from Your fear. For Your servants' sake, return the tribes of Your inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'> For a little while Your holy people possessed it. Our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'> We are of old; You never ruled over them. Your name was never called on them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'> Oh that You would tear the heavens and come down, that mountains would quake before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>  As the brushwood fire burns and fire causes water to boil, make known Your name to Your foes, that nations might tremble before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'> When You did terrifying things which we did not look for, You came down; mountains flowed down before You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'> And from forever they have not heard; they did not give ear. Eye has not seen a God except You, who works for him who waits for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'> You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness; they recall You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned. In I them is eternity, we shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'> But we are all as the unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as a menstruous cloth. And we all fade as a leaf, and like the wind our iniquities take us away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'> And there is not one who calls on Your name, who stirs himself up to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away into the hand of our iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'> But now, Jehovah, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You are our Former; yea, we all are Your handiwork.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'> Do not be extremely angry, Jehovah, and do not remember iniquity forever. Behold! look, please; all of us are Your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'> Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness; Jerusalem is a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'> The house of our holiness and our beauty where our fathers praised You has become a burning of fire, and all our pleasant things have become a ruin.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'> I have been sought, not by those who asked. I have been found, not by those who sought Me. To a nation not calling on My name, I said, Behold Me! Behold Me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'> I have spread out My hands all the day long to a rebellious people who walk in the way not good, after their own thoughts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'> a people who continually provoke Me to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on the bricks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'> who sit among the graves and lodge in the towers; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of unclean things in their pots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'> who say, Keep to yourself! Do not come near me, for I am holier than you! These are a smoke in My nose, a fire burning all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'> Behold! It is written before Me: I will not be silent, except I repay; yea, I will repay to their bosom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'> our iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah; they that burned incense on the mountains, and have blasphemed Me on the hills. And I will measure their former work on their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'> So says Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do for the sake of My servants, not to destroy the whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one to inherit My mountains. And My chosen one shall inherit, and My servants shall live there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'> And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks; and the valley of Achor a resting place of herds for My people who have sought Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'> But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain; who array a table for Fortune, and who fill mixed wine for Fate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'> And I will number you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because I called and you did not answer. I spoke, and you did not hear; and you did the evil in My eyes; and you chose that in which I had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'> So the Lord Jehovah says this: Behold, My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'> Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry from heartbreak, and howl from breaking of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'> And you shall leave your name for a curse to My chosen. And the Lord Jehovah shall kill you; and He shall call His servants by another name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>  He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former distresses are forgotten; and because they are hidden from My eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'> For, behold, I create new heavens and new earth. And the things before shall not be recalled, and they shall not go up on the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'> However, be glad and rejoice forever in what I create. For, behold, I create in Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people. And the voice of weeping and the voice of crying shall no longer be heard in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'> There shall not still be an infant of days, or an old man that has not filled his days. For the youth shall die the son of a hundred years, but the sinner the son of a hundred years shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'> And they shall build houses and live in them ; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'> They shall not build, and another live in them ; they shall not plant, and another eat. For like the days of the tree are the days of My people; and My elect shall grow old to the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'> They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for terror. For they are the seed of the beloved ones of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'> And it will be, before they call, I will answer. While they are speaking, then I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'> The wolf and the lamb shall feed as one; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And dust is the food of the snake. They shall not do evil nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'> So says Jehovah: Heaven is My throne, and earth the footstool of My feet. Where then is the house that you build for Me? And where then is the place of My rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'> And My hand has made all these things, even all these things exist, declares Jehovah. But I will look toward this one, to the afflicted, and to the contrite of spirit, even trembling at My word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'> He who kills an ox is as if he struck a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dog's neck; he who offers a present is as if it were swine's blood; he who marks incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their way, and their soul delights in their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'> I also will choose their vexations; and I will bring their fears to them; because I called, and no one answered; I spoke, and they did not hear. But they did the evil in My eyes, and chose that in which I had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'> Hear the word of Jehovah, those who tremble at His word. Your brothers who hate you, who drive you out for My name's sake, have said, Jehovah is glorified. But He shall appear in your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'> A roaring sound from the city! A sound from the temple! It is the sound of Jehovah repaying retribution to His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before pain came to her, she delivered a male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'> Who has heard a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Shall the earth be brought forth in one day? Shall a nation be born in one step? For Zion travailed and also brought forth her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'> Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Jehovah. Surely I cause birth, and hold back, says your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'> Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all who love her. Rejoice a rejoicing with her, all who mourn for her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'> that you may suck and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may milk out and delight yourselves with the fullness of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'> For so says Jehovah: Behold, I stretch out peace to her like a river, and glory of nations like an overflowing torrent. And You shall suck; you shall be carried on the side and be dandled on knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'> As a man whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you. And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'> And you will see, and your heart shall rejoice; and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and He shall be indignant with His enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'> For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and His chariots like the tempest, to return His wrath in fury, and His rebuke in flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'> For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will execute judgment with all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'> Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to the gardens, each one in the midst, eaters of swine's flesh, and the hateful thing, and the mouse, these are cut off together, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'> For I know their works and their thoughts; it comes to gather all the nations and the tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape from them to the nations of Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawers of the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the far away coasts that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'> And they shall bring all your brothers out of all nations, an offering to Jehovah, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah; as the sons of Israel bring the offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'> And I will also take some of them for the priests, for the Levites, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'> For as the new heavens and the new earth which I make stand before Me, declares Jehovah, so your seed and your name shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'> And it will be, from new moon to its new moon, and from sabbath to its sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'> And they shall go out and see the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be put out; and they shall be an object of disgust to all flesh.</verse>
