      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the saints being in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'> Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies with Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'> according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, for us to be holy and without blemish before Him in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'> predestinating us to adoption through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'> to the praise of the glory of His grace in which He favored us in the One having been loved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'> in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'> which He caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'> making known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'> for the administration of the fullness of the times to head up all things in Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things on earth, in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'> in whom we also have been chosen to an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of the One working all things according to the counsel of His own will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'> for us to be to the praise of His glory, the ones who had previously trusted in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'> in whom also you, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'> who is an earnest of our inheritance, to the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'> Because of this, hearing of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>  I also do not cease giving thanks on your behalf, making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'> that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'> the eyes of your mind having been enlightened, for you to know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'> and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, the ones believing according to the working of His mighty strength</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'> which He worked in Christ in raising Him from the dead; yea, He seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'> far above all principality, and authority, and power, and lordship, and every name being named, not only in this age, but also in the coming age ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'> and He "put all things under His feet" and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, Psa. 8:6</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'> which is His body: the fullness of Him filling all things in all;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'> and He worked in you who were once dead in trespasses and sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'> in which you then walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit now working in the sons of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'> among whom we also all conducted ourselves in times past in the lusts of our flesh, doing the things willed of the flesh and of the understandings, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'> But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'> even we being dead in sins, He made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are being saved),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'> and raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'> that He might show in the coming ages the exceeding great riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'> For by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'> not of works, that not anyone should boast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'> for we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'> Because of this, remember that you, the nations, were then in the flesh (those having been called Uncircumcision by those having been called Circumcision in the flesh made by hand)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'> that at that time you were without Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers of the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'> But now, in Christ Jesus you who then were afar off came to be near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'> For He is our peace, He making us both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'> in His flesh causing to cease the enmity, the Law of the commandments in decrees, that He might in Himself create the two into one new man, making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'> and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity in Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'> And coming, He proclaimed "peace to you, the ones afar off, and to the ones near." Isa. 57:19</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'> For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'> So, then, you are no longer strangers and tenants, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'> being built up on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the cornerstone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'> in whom every building having been fitted together grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'> in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'> For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'> if, indeed, you heard of the stewardship of the grace of God given to me for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'> that by revelation He made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'> by the reading of which you are able to realize my understanding in the mystery of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'> which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations, as it now has been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>  for the nations to be joint-heirs, and a joint-body and joint-sharers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'> of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according to the working of His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'> This grace was given to me, less than the least of all the saints, to proclaim the gospel of the unsearchable riches of Christ among the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'> and to bring to light all, what is the fellowship of the mystery having been hidden from eternity in God, the One creating all things through Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'> so that now to the rulers and to the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'> according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through His faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'> Therefore, I ask you not to faint at my troubles on your behalf, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'> For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'> of whom every family in Heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'> that He may give you, according to the riches of His glory, by His power to become mighty in the inward man through His Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'> that through faith Christ may dwell in your hearts, having been rooted and founded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'> that you may be given strength to grasp, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and depth and height,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'> and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'> Now to Him being able to do exceedingly above all that we ask or think, according to the power working in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'> to Him be the glory in the church in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age forever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'> Then I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to walk worthily of the calling in which you were called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'> with all humility and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'> being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>  There is one body and one Spirit, even as you also were called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'> one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'> one God and Father of all, He above all and through all and in you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'> But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'> Because of this, He says, "Having gone up on high, He led captivity captive," and gave "gifts to men." Psa. 68:18</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'> But that He went up, what is it except that He also first came down into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'> He that came down is the same who also went up above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'> And indeed He gave some to be apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists; and some pastors and teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'> with a view to the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'> until we all may come to the unity of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'> so that we may no longer be infants, having been blown and carried to and fro by every wind of doctrine, in the underhandedness of men, in craftiness with a view to the trickery of error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'> but speaking the truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the head, the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'> from whom all the body, having been fitted and compacted together through every assisting bond, according to the effectual working of one measure in each part, produces the growth of the body to the building up of itself in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'> Therefore, I say this, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk even as also the rest of the nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'> having been darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance which is in them because of the hardness of their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'> who, having cast off all feeling, gave themselves up to lust, for the working of all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'> But you have not so learned Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'> if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him, as the truth is in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'> for you have put off the old man, as regards the former behavior, having been corrupted according to the deceitful lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'> and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'> and to put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'> Therefore, putting off the false," speak truth each with his neighbor," because we are members of one another. Zech. 8:16</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'> "Be angry but do not sin;" do not let the sun go down on your wrath, LXX-Psa. 4:4; MT-Psa. 4:5</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'> nor give place to the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'> The one stealing, let him steal no more, but rather let him labor, working what is good with the hands, that he may have something to give to the one that has need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'> Let not any filthy word go out of your mouth, but if any is good to building up in respect to the need, that it may give grace to the ones hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed to the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'> Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and tumult, and evil speaking be put away from you, along with all evil things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'> And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, having forgiven one another, even as also God forgave you in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'> Then be imitators of God, as beloved children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'> and walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'> But let not fornication, and all uncleanness, or greediness, be named among you, as is fitting for saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'> also baseness, and foolish talking, or joking (the things not becoming), but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'> For be knowing this, that every fornicator, or unclean one, or covetous one , who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for through these the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'> Then do not be partners with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'> for you then were darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'> For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'> proving what is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'> For it is shameful even to speak of the things being done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'> But all things being exposed by the light are clearly revealed, for everything having been revealed is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'> Because of this, He says, Arise, sleeping ones and stand up out of the dead ones, and Christ will shine on you. No OT passage</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'> Then watch how carefully you walk, not as unwise, but as wise ones,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'> For this reason, do not be foolish, but understanding what the will of the Lord is .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'> And "do not be drunk with wine," in which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit, Prov. 23:31</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'> speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and praising in your heart to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'> giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, even to God the Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'> having been subject to one another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'> Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'> because a husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is Head of the church, and He is Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'> But even as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up on its behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'> that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the washing of the water in the Word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'> that He might present it to Himself as the glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such things, but that it be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'> So, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies, (he loving his wife loves himself),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'> for then no one hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Lord the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'> For we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'> "For this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh." Gen. 2:24</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'> The mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ and as to the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'> However, you also, everyone, let each love his wife as himself, and the wife, that she give deference to the husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'> "Honor your father and mother," which is the first commandment with a promise, Ex. 20:12</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'> "that it may be well with you, and you may be long-lived on the earth". Deut. 5:16</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'> And fathers, do not provoke your children, but bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'> Slaves, obey your lords according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'> not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'> serving as slaves with good will to the Lord, and not as to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'> each one knowing that whatever good thing he does, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a slave or a freeman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'> And lords, do the same things toward them, forbearing threatening, knowing that the Lord of you and of them is in Heaven, and there is no respect of persons with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'> For the rest, my brothers, be made powerful in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'> Put on all the armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'> because we are not wrestling against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world's rulers, of the darkness of this age, against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenlies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'> Because of this, take up all of the armor of God that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having worked out all things, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'> Then stand firm, "having girded your loins about with truth" and having put "on the breastplate of righteousness," Isa. 11:5; 59:17</verse>
