      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'> He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'> All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'> In Him was life, and the life was the light of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'> and the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'> There was a man sent from God; his name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'> He came for a witness, that he might witness concerning the Light, that all might believe through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'> He was not that Light, but that he might witness concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'> He was the true Light; He enlightens every man coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'> He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'> He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'> But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to the ones believing into His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'> who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'> And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. And we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from the Father, full of grace and of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'> witnesses concerning Him, and has cried out, saying, This One was He of whom I said, He coming after me has been before me, for He was preceding me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'> And out of His fullness we all received, and grace on top of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'> For the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'> No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, that One reveals Him .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'> And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites that they might ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'> And he acknowledged and did not deny; yea, he acknowledged, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'> And they asked him, What, then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'> Then they said to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those sending us? What do you say about yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'> He said, "I am a voice crying in the wilderness:" "Make straight" "the way of the Lord," as Isaiah the prophet said. Isa. 40:3</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'> And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'> And they asked him and said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'> answered them, saying, I baptize in water, but One stands in your midst whom you do not know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'> This One it is who has come after me, who has been before me, of whom I am not worthy that I should loose the thong of His sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'> These things took place in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'> On the morrow, sees Jesus coming toward him and said, Behold! The Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'> This is He about whom I said, After me comes a Man who has been before me, for He was preceding me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'> And I did not know Him; but that He be revealed to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'> And witnessed, saying, I have seen the Spirit coming down as a dove out of Heaven, and He abode on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'> And I did not know Him, but the One sending me to baptize in water, that One said to me, On whomever you see the Spirit coming down and abiding on Him, this is the One baptizing in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'> And I have seen and have witnessed that this One is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'> Again on the morrow, and two from his disciples stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'> And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'> And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'> But having seen them following, Jesus said to them, What do you seek? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which being translated is called Teacher), where do You stay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'> He said to them, Come and see. They went and saw where He stayed, and they remained with Him that day. And the hour was about the tenth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'> Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two who heard from and was following Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'> This one first found his own brother Simon and tells him, We have found the Messiah (which being translated is, the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'> And he led him to Jesus. And looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which translated is Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'> And on the morrow, Jesus desired to go out into Galilee. And He found Philip, and says to him, Follow me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'> And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'> Philip finds Nathanael and said to him, We have found the One of whom Moses wrote in the Law and the Prophets, Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'> And Nathanael said to him, Can any good thing be out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'> Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'> Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called, you being under the fig tree, I saw you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'> Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'> Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'> And He says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, from now on you will see Heaven opened, and "the angels of God ascending and descending" on the Son of man. Gen. 28:12</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'> And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'> And Jesus and His disciples also were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'> And being short of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'> Jesus said to her, What is that to Me and to you, woman? My hour has not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'> His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'> And there were six stone waterpots standing, according to the purification of the Jews, each containing two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'> Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'> And He said to them, Now draw out and carry to the master of the feast. And they carried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'> But when the master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know from where it was (but the servants drawing the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'> and he said to him, Every man first sets on the good wine, and when they have drunk freely, then the worse. You have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'> This beginning of the miracles Jesus did in Cana of Galilee. And it revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'> After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples. And He remained there not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'> And the Passover of the Jews was near. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'> And He found those selling oxen and sheep and doves in the temple, and the money changers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'> And making a whip out of ropes, He threw all out of the temple, both the sheep, and the oxen, and the money changers, pouring out the money and overturning the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'> And to the ones selling the doves, He said, Take these things from here! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'> And His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of Your house has consumed Me." Psa. 69:9</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'> Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do you show to us, since you do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'> Jesus said to them, Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'> Then the Jews said, This sanctuary was forty six years being built, and do you raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'> But He spoke about the sanctuary of His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'> Then when He was raised from the dead, His disciples recalled that He said this to them. And they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'> And as He was in Jerusalem, at the Passover, at the Feast, many believed into His name, seeing the miracles which He did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'> But Jesus Himself did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'> and because He had no need that anyone should witness concerning man, for He knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'> But there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus his name, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'> This one came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come as a teacher from God. For no one is able to do these miracles which You do, except God be with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'> Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, if one does not receive birth from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'> Nicodemus said to Him, How is a man able to be born, being old? He is not able to enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'> Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, if one does not receive birth out of water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'> That receiving birth from the flesh is flesh, and that receiving birth from the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'> Do not wonder because I told you, You must receive birth from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'> The Spirit breathes where He desires, and you hear His voice; but you do not know from where He comes, and where He goes; so is everyone who has received birth from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'> Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things come about?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'> Jesus answered and said to him, You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'> Truly, truly, I say to you, That which we know, we speak; and that which we have seen, we testify. And you do not receive our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'> If I tell you earthly things, and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'> And no one has gone up into Heaven, except He having come down out of Heaven, the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'> And even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'> that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'> For God did not send His Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'> The one believing into Him is not condemned; but the one not believing has already been condemned, for he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'> And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than the Light, for their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'> For everyone practicing wickedness hates the Light, and does not come to the Light, that his works may not be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'> But the one doing the truth comes to the Light, that his works may be revealed, that they exist, having been worked in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'> After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea. And He continued there with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'> And was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, for many waters were there. And they came and were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'> For had not yet been thrown into the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'> Then a question from John's disciples arose with the Jews about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'> And they came to and said to him, Teacher, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have witnessed, behold, this one baptizes, and all are coming to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'> answered and said, A man is able to receive nothing unless it has been given to him from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'> You yourselves witness to me that I said, I am not the Christ, but that having been sent, I am going before that One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'> The one having the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. Then this my joy has been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'> That One must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'> The One coming from above is above all. The one being of the earth is earthy, and speaks of the earth. The One coming out of Heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'> And what He has seen and heard, this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'> The one receiving His testimony has sealed that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'> For the One whom God sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'> The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'> The one believing into the Son has everlasting life; but the one disobeying the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'> Then when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus made more disciples and baptized more than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'> (though truly Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'> He left Judea and went away into Galilee again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'> And it was needful for Him to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'> And He came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the piece of land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'> And Jacob's fountain was there. Then being wearied by the journey, Jesus sat thus on the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'> A woman came out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me some to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'> For His disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'> Then the Samaritan woman said to Him, How do you, being a Jew, ask to drink from me, I being a Samaritan woman? For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'> Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who is the One saying to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked Him, and He would give you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'> The woman said to Him, Sir, you have no vessel, and the well is deep. From where then do you have living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'> Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us the well, and he and his sons and his livestock drank out of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'> Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone drinking of this water will thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'> but whoever may drink of the water which I will give him will never ever thirst, but the water which I will give to him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'> The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'> Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'> And the woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Well did you say, I have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'> For you have had five husbands, and now he whom you have is not your husband. You have spoken this truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'> The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'> Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'> Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me that an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'> You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'> But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeks such ones that worship Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'> God is a spirit, and the ones worshiping Him must worship in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'> The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming, the One called Christ. When that One comes, He will announce to us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'> Jesus said to her, I AM, the One speaking to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'> And on this, His disciples came and marveled that He was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, What do you seek? Or, Why do You speak with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'> Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city and said to the men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'> Come, see a Man who told me all things, whatever I did. Is this One not the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'> Therefore, they went out of the city and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'> But in the meantime the disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'> But He said to them, I have food to eat which you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'> Then the disciples said to one another, No one brought Him food to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'> Jesus said to them, My food is that I should do the will of Him who sent Me, and that I may finish His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'> Do you do not say, It is yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'> And the one reaping receives reward, and gathers fruit to everlasting life, so that both the one sowing and the one reaping may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'> For in this the word is true, that another is the one sowing, and another the one reaping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'> I sent you to reap what you have not labored over. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'> And many of the Samaritans out of that city believed into Him, because of the word of the woman testifying, He told me all things, whatever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'> Then as the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them. And He remained there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'> And many more believed through His word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'> And they said to the woman, We no longer believe because of your saying; for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this One is truly the Savior of the world, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'> But after the two days, He went out from there, and went away into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'> For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own native place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'> Therefore, when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, seeing all things which He did in Jerusalem at the Feast. For they also went to the Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'> Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'> Hearing that Jesus was coming from Judea into Galilee, this one went out to Him and asked Him that He would come and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'> Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not at all believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'> The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'> Jesus said to him, Go! Your son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'> But already, as he was going down, his slaves met him and reported, saying, Your child lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'> He then asked from them the hour in which he had gotten better. And they said to him, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'> Then the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and his whole household, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'> Again, this second miracle Jesus did, coming from Judea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'> After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'> And at Jerusalem is a pool at the Sheep Gate which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'> In these was a great multitude of the infirm lying, blind ones, lame ones, withered ones, awaiting the stirring of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'> For an angel from time to time descended in the pool and agitated the water. Then the one first entering after the agitation of the water became well, whatever disease he was held by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'> But a certain man was there, being in infirmity thirty eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'> Seeing him lying, and knowing that he had already spent much time, Jesus said to him, Do you desire to become well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'> The infirm one answered Him, Lord, I do not have a man, that when the water is agitated he may throw me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'> Jesus said to him, Rise up, Take up your cot and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'> And instantly the man became well, and took up his cot and walked. And it was a sabbath that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'> Then the Jews said to the one having been healed, It is a sabbath. It is not lawful for you to lift up the cot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'> He answered them, The One making me well, that One said to me, Lift up your cot and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'> Then they asked him, Who is the man who told you, Lift up your cot and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'> But he did not know the One who cured him, for a crowd being in that place, Jesus had withdrawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'> After these things, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well, sin no more that a worse thing not happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'> The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus is the One making him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'> And because of this, the Jews persecuted Jesus and lusted to kill Him, because He did these things on a sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'> But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'> Because of this, therefore, the Jews lusted the more to kill Him, for not only did He break the sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'> Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, except what He may see the Father doing; for whatever that One does, these things also the Son does the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'> For the Father loves the Son and shows to Him all things which He does. And He will show Him greater works than these in order that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'> For even as the Father raises the dead, and gives life, so also the Son gives life to whomever He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'> For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'> so that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. The one not honoring the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'> Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes the One who has sent Me, has everlasting life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'> Truly, truly, I say to you that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones hearing will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'> For even as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'> And He also gave authority to Him to execute judgment, for He is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'> Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear His voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'> And they will come out, the ones having done good into a resurrection of life; and the ones having practiced evil into a resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'> I am able to do nothing from Myself; just as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, for I do not seek My will, but the will of the One sending Me, the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'> If I witness concerning Myself, My witness is not true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'> it is Another that witnesses concerning Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses concerning Me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'> You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'> But I do not receive witness from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'> That one was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to exult in his light for an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'> But I have the greater witness than John's, for the works which the Father has given Me, that I should finish them, the works which I do themselves witness concerning Me, that the Father has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'> And the Father, He sending Me, has Himself borne witness concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'> And you do not have His word abiding in you, for the One whom that One sent, this One you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'> You search the Scriptures, for you think in them you have everlasting life. And they are the ones witnessing concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'> And you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'> I do not receive glory from men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'> but I have known you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'> I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive that one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'> How are you able to believe, you who receive glory from one another, and the glory which is from the only God you do not seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one accusing you, Moses, in whom you have hoped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'> For if you were believing Moses, you would then believe Me; for that one wrote concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'> But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'> After these things, Jesus went away over the Sea of Galilee, the Tiberian Sea .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'> And a great crowd followed Him, for they saw His miracles which He did on the sick ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'> And Jesus went up into the mountain and sat there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'> And the Passover was near, the feast of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'> Then Jesus lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to Him, He said to Philip, From where may we buy loaves that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'> But He said this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'> Philip answered Him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not enough for them, that each of them may receive a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'> One of His disciples said to Him, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'> A little boy is here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'> And Jesus said, Make the men to recline. And much grass was in the place. Then the men reclined, the number was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'> And Jesus took the loaves, and giving thanks distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those reclining. And in the same way the fish, as much as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'> And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments left over, that not anything be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'> Then they gathered and filled twelve hand baskets with fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over to those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'> Then seeing what miracle Jesus did, the men said, This is truly the Prophet, the one coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'> Then knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain alone by Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'> And when it became evening, His disciples went down on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'> And entering into the boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had already occurred, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'> And the sea was aroused by a great wind blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'> Then having rowed about twenty five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea. And He having come near the boat, they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'> But He said to them, I AM! Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'> Then they desired to take Him into the boat. And the boat was instantly at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'> On the morrow, the crowd standing on the other side of the sea had seen that no other little boat was there except one, that one into which His disciples entered, and that Jesus did not go with His disciples into the small boat, but that the disciples went away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'> But other small boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the loaves, the Lord having given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'> Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there nor His disciples, they themselves also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'> And finding Him across the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did you come here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'> Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me not because you saw miracles, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'> Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you; for God the Father sealed this One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'> Then they said to Him, What may we do that we may work the works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'> Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom that One sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'> Then they said to Him, Then what miracle do you do that we may see and may believe you? What do you work?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written "He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat." LXX-Psa. 77:24; MT-Psa. 78:24</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'> Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'> For the bread of God is He coming down out of Heaven and giving life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'> Then they said to Him, Lord, always give us this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'> Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of life; the one coming to Me will not at all hunger, and the one believing into Me will never ever thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'> But I said to you that you also have seen Me and did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'> All that the Father gives to Me shall come to Me, and the one coming to Me I will in no way cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'> For I have come down out of Heaven, not that I should do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'> And this is the will of the Father sending Me, that of all that He has given Me, I shall not lose any of it, but shall raise it up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'> And this is the will of the One sending Me, that everyone seeing the Son and believing into Him should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'> Then the Jews murmured about Him, because He said, I am the Bread coming down out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'> And they said, Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, of whom we know the father and the mother? How does this one now say, I have come down out of Heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'> Then Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'> No one is able to come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'> It has been written in the Prophets, They "shall" all "be taught of God." So then everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me; Isa. 54:13</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'> not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One being from God, He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'> Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing into Me has everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'> I am the Bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'> This is the Bread coming down out of Heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'> I am the Living Bread that came down from Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever. And indeed the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'> Then the Jews argued with one another, saying, How can this one give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'> Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'> The one partaking of My flesh and drinking of My blood has everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'> For My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'> The one partaking of My flesh and drinking of My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'> Even as the living Father sent Me, and I live through the Father; also the one partaking Me, even that one will live through Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'> This is the Bread which came down out of Heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died; the one partaking of this Bread will live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'> He said these things teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'> Then many of His disciples having heard, they said, This word is hard; who is able to hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'> But knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, Jesus said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'> Then what if you see the Son of man going up where He was at first?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'> It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not profit, nothing! The words which I speak to you are spirit and are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'> But there are some of you who are not believing. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were not believing, and who was the one betraying Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'> And He said, Because of this, I have told you that no one is able to come to Me except it is given to him from My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'> From this time many of His disciples went away into the things behind, and no longer walked with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'> Therefore, Jesus said to the Twelve, Do you also wish to go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'> Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'> And we have believed and have known that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'> Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'> But He spoke of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, for this one was about to betray Him, being one of the Twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'> And after these things Jesus was walking in Galilee; for He did not desire to walk in Judea, because the Jews were lusting to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'> And the Jewish Feast of the Tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'> Then His brothers said to Him, Move away from here and go to Judea, that your disciples will also see your works which you do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'> for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be in public. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'> For His brothers did not believe into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'> Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet here, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'> The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I witness about it, that its works are evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.11'> Then the Jews sought Him in the feast, and said, Where is He?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'> And much murmuring about Him was in the crowds. Some said, He is a good one; but others said, No, but he deceives the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'> However, no one publicly spoke about Him, because of the fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'> But the feast now being half over, Jesus went up to the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'> And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this one know letters, not being taught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'> Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but of the One who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'> If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or I speak from Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'> The one speaking from himself seeks his own glory. But the one seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'> Has not Moses given you the Law, and not one of you does the Law? Why do you lust to kill Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'> The crowd answered and said, You have a demon. Who lusts to kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'> Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'> Because of this Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on a sabbath, you circumcise a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'> If a man receives circumcision on a sabbath, that the Law of Moses is not broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man entirely sound on a sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'> Do not judge according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'> Then some of the Jerusalemites said, Is this not the one they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'> And, behold, He speaks publicly, and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the rulers truly knew that this is indeed the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'> But we know this one, from where he is. But when the Christ comes, no one knows from where He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'> Then teaching, Jesus cried out in the temple, even saying, You both know Me, and you know from where I am. And I have not come from Myself, but He sending Me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'> But I know Him, because I am from Him; and He sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'> Then they sought to seize Him; yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'> But many of the crowd believed into Him, and said, The Christ, when He comes will He do more miracles than these which this One did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers, that they might seize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'> Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'> You will seek Me, and will not find Me ; and where I am, you are not able to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'> Then the Jews said amongst themselves, Where is this one about to go that we will not find him? Is he about to go to the Dispersion of the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'> What is this word which he said, You will seek Me and will not find Me , and, Where I am, you are not able to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'> And in the last day of the great feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'> The one believing into Me, as the Scripture said, Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. No OT passage</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'> But He said this concerning the Spirit, whom the ones believing into Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'> Then hearing the word, many of the crowd said, This is truly the Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'> Others said, This is the Christ. But others said, No! For does the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'> Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? Mic. 5:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'> Therefore, a division occurred in the crowd because of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'> And some of them desired to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'> Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, Why did you not bring him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'> The officers answered, Never did a man so speak as does this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'> Then the Pharisees answered them, Have you not also been deceived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'> Not any from the rulers or from the Pharisees believed into him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'> But not knowing the Law, this crowd is cursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'> Nicodemus said to them, the one coming by night to Him, being one of themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'> Does our Law judge the Man unless it hear from him first, and know what he does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'> They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that a prophet has not been raised out of Galilee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.1'> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'> And at dawn, He again arrived into the temple; and all the people came to Him. And sitting down, He taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'> And the scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman having been taken in adultery. And standing her in the middle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'> they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was taken in the very act, committing adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'> And in the Law, Moses commanded that such should be stoned. You, then, what do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'> But they said this, tempting Him, that they may have reason to accuse Him. But bending down, Jesus wrote with the finger in the earth, not appearing to hear .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'> But as they continued questioning Him, bending back up, He said to them, The one among you without sin, let him cast the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'> And bending down again, He wrote in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'> But hearing, and being convicted by the conscience, they went out one by one, beginning from the older ones, until the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'> And Jesus bending back up, and having seen no one but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are those who accused you? Did not one give judgment against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'> And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I give judgment. Go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'> Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, I am the Light of the world. The one following Me will in no way walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'> Then the Pharisees said to Him, You witnessed concerning yourself; your witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'> Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I witness concerning Myself, My witness is true; for I know from where I came, and where I go. But you do not know from where I came, and where I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'> You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'> But even if I judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'> And in your Law it has been written that the witness of two men is true. Deut. 19:15</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.19'> Then they said to Him, Where is your father? Jesus answered, You neither know Me, nor My Father. If you had known Me, then you also would have known My Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'> Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'> Then Jesus said to them again, I go, and you will seek Me. And you will die in your sin. Where I go, you are not able to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'> Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I go, you are not able to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'> And He said to them, You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.25'> Then they said to Him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Altogether what I also say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'> I have many things to say and to judge concerning you; but the One sending Me is true, and what I heard from Him, these things I say to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'> They did not know that He spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'> Then Jesus said to them, When you lift up the Son of man, then you will know that I AM; and from Myself I do nothing; but as My Father taught Me, these things I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'> And the One who sent Me is with Me. The Father did not leave Me alone, for I do the things pleasing to Him always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>  As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'> Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in Him, If you continue in My Word, you are truly My disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'> And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'> They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed, and we have been in slavery to no one, never! How do you say, You will become free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'> Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone practicing sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'> But the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'> Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you are free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'> I know that you are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill Me, because My Word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'> I speak what I have seen with My Father. And you therefore do what you have seen with your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'> They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'> But now you seek to kill Me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I heard alongside of God. Abraham did not do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'> You do the works of your father. They said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one father, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'> Then Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I went forth and have come from God. For I have not come from Myself, but that One sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'> Why do you not know My speech? It is because you are not able to hear My Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'> You are of the Devil as father, and the lusts of your father you desire to do. That one was a murderer from the beginning, and he has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, because he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'> And because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'> Who of you reproves Me concerning sin? But if I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'> The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear, because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'> Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'> Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'> But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'> Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My Word, he will never ever see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'> Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets, and you say, If anyone keeps My Word, he will never ever taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'> Are you greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died! Whom do you make yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'> Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, whom you say is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'> And you have not known Him; but I know Him, And if I say that I do not know Him, I shall be like you, a liar. But I know Him, and I keep His Word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'> Your father Abraham leaped for joy that he should see My day, and he saw, and rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'> Then the Jews said to Him, You do not yet have fifty years, and have you seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'> Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I AM.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'> Because of this, they took up stones that they might throw them on Him. But Jesus was hidden, and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'> And passing by, He saw a man blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'> And His disciples asked Him, saying, Teacher, who sinned, this one, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'> Jesus answered, Neither this one nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God might be revealed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'> It is necessary for Me to work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day. Night comes when no one is able to work.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.6'> Saying these things, He spat on the ground and made clay out of the spittle, and anointed clay on the blind one's eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'> And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which translated is Sent. Then he went and washed, and came seeing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.9'> Some said, It is he; and others, He is like him. That one said, I am the one .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'> Then they said to him, How were your eyes opened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'> He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and told me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. And going and washing I received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'> Then they said to him, Where is that one? He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'> They brought him to the Pharisees, the one once blind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.16'> Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a man, a sinner, do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'> They said to the blind one again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'> Then the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and received sight, until they called the parents of him having received sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom you say that he was born blind? Then how does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'> But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age, ask him. He will speak about himself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.23'> Because of this, his parents said, He is of age, ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'> Then a second time they called the man who was blind, and they said to him, Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.2'> But the one entering through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'> The doorkeeper opens to him, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.7'> Then Jesus again said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'> All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'> I am the door. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in, and will go out, and will find pasture.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.1'> And there was a certain sick one, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'> And it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'> Then the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, the one whom You love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'> And hearing, Jesus said, This is not sickness to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'> And Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'> Therefore, when He heard that he is sick, then, indeed, He remained in the place where He was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'> Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'> The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, just now the Jews were seeking to stone You, and do You go there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'> But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'> He said these things. And after this, He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going that I may awaken him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'> Then His disciples said, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'> But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He spoke of the sleep of slumber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'> Therefore, then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'> And I rejoice because of you, in order that you may believe that I was not there. But let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'> Then Thomas, he having been called Twin, said to the fellow disciples, Let us go, even we, that we may die with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'> Then coming, Jesus found him already being held in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'> And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.27'> She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'> And saying these things, she went away and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'> That one, when she heard, rose up quickly and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'> And Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'> Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and consoling her, seeing that Mary quickly rose up and went out, they followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb so that she may weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'> Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing Him, she fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'> Then when He saw her weeping, and the Jews who came down with her weeping, Jesus groaned in the spirit and troubled Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'> And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'> Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'> Then the Jews said, See how He loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'> But some of them said, Was this One, the one opening the eyes of the blind, not able to have caused that this one should not die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'> Then groaning again within Himself, Jesus came to the tomb. And it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'> Jesus said, Lift the stone. Martha, the sister of the one that had died, said to Him, Lord, he already smells, for it is the fourth day .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'> Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you will see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'> Then they lifted the stone where the dead one was laid. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, Father, I thank You that You heard Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'> And I know that you always hear Me, but because of the crowd standing around, I said it , that they might believe that You sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'> And saying these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus! Here! Outside!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'> And the one who had died came out, the feet and the hands having been bound with sheets, and his face being bound with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Loosen him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'> Then many of the Jews, those coming to Mary, and having seen what Jesus did, believed into Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'> But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a sanhedrin, and said, What are we doing, for this man does many miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'> If we let him alone this way, all will believe into him, and the Romans will come and will take away from us both the place and the nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas being high priest of that year, said to them, You know nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'> nor consider that it is profitable for us that one man die for the people, and not all the nation to perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'> But he did not say this from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die on behalf of the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'> and not only on behalf of the nation, but that He also might gather into one the children of God who had been scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'> Then from that day, they took counsel that they might kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'> Then Jesus no longer walked publicly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near a deserted place , to a city being called Ephraim, and stayed there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'> And the Passover of the Jews was near. And many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover, that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'> Then they sought Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What does it seem to you? That He does not at all come to the Feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'> And all the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commands that if anyone knew where He is, he should inform so that they might seize Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'> Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had died, whom He raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'> Then they made Him a supper there, and Martha served. But Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'> Then taking a pound of ointment of pure, costly spikenard, Mary anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped off His feet with her hairs. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'> Then Simon's son , one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'> Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'> But he said this, not that he was caring for the poor, but that he was a thief and held the moneybag and carried away the things being put in .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'> Then Jesus said, Allow her, for she has kept it for the day of My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'> For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'> Then a great crowd of the Jews learned that He was there. And they did not come because of Jesus alone, but that they also might see Lazarus whom He raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'> But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus to death also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'> because through him many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'> On the morrow, coming to the Feast, hearing that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, a great crowd</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'> took palm branches and went out to a meeting with Him, and they were crying out, Hosanna! "Blessed is He coming in the name of the Lord," the King of Israel! Psa. 118:26</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'> And finding an ass colt, Jesus sat on it, even as it had been written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'> "Do not fear," "daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes" "sitting on" "the foal of an ass." Isa. 40:9; Zech. 9:9</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'> But His disciples did not know these things at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they recalled that these things had been written on Him, and that they did these things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'> Then the crowd which was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, witnessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'> Because of this also the crowd met Him, because it heard of this miracle He had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'> Then the Pharisees said to themselves, Observe that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'> And there were some Greeks among those coming up, that they might worship at the Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'> Then these came to Philip, the one from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'> Philip came and told Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'> But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'> Truly, truly, I say to you, unless the grain of wheat that falls into the earth dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'> The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'> If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will also be. And if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'> And My soul is troubled, and what may I say? Father, save Me out of this hour? But on this account I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'> Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came out of the heaven: I both glorified it , and I will glorify it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'> Then standing and hearing, the crowd said that thunder occurred. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'> Jesus answered and said, This voice has not occurred because of Me, but because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'> Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to Myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'> But He said this, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'> The crowd answered Him, We heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever. And how do you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'> Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness not overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'> While you have the Light, believe into the Light, that you may become sons of Light. Jesus spoke these things, and going away He was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'> But though He had done so many miracles before them, they did not believe into Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'> so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said, "Lord, who has believed our report? And the arm of the Lord, to whom was it revealed?" Isa. 53:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'> Because of this they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'> "He has blinded their eyes" and "has hardened their heart," "that they might not see with the eyes" and "understand with the heart," "and be converted," "and I should heal them." Isa. 6:10</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'> Isaiah said these things when he saw His glory, and spoke about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'> Still, however, even out of the rulers, many did believe into Him. But because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing, so that they not be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'> For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'> But Jesus cried out and said, The one believing into Me does not believe into Me, but into the One sending Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'> And the one seeing Me sees the One who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'> I have come as a Light to the world, that everyone who believes into Me may not remain in the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'> And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'> The one who rejects Me and does not receive My words has that judging him: the Word which I spoke, that will judge him in the last Day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'> For I did not speak from Myself, but He who sent Me, the Father, He has given Me command, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'> Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged Him .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'> And having plaited a wreath out of thorns, the soldiers put it on His head. And they threw a purple mantle around Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'> and said, Hail, king of the Jews! And they gave Him blows with the palm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'> Then Pilate went outside again and said to them, Behold, I bring Him out to you that you may know that I do not find even one crime in Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'> Then Jesus came outside, wearing the thorny wreath and the purple mantle. And he said to them, Behold, the Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'> Then when the chief priests and the under-officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take him and crucify him , for I do not find one crime in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'> Then the Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our Law he ought to die because he made himself Son of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'> Then when Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'> And he entered into the praetorium again and said to Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus did not give him an answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'> So Pilate said to Him, Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'> Jesus answered, You would have no authority against Me, not any, if it were not given to you from above. Because of this, the one delivering Me to you has a greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'> From this time , Pilate sought to release Him. But the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this one, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'> Then hearing this word, Pilate led Jesus out. And he sat down on the judgment seat, at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'> And it was the Preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold, your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'> But they cried out, Away, Away! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'> Therefore, then, he delivered Him up to them, that He might be crucified. And they took Jesus and led Him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'> And He went out bearing His cross, to the place called Of a Skull (which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'> where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'> And Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. And having been written, it was: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'> Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it had been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'> Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'> Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'> Then when they crucified Jesus, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part to each soldier, also the tunic. And the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'> Then they said to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots about it, whose it will be (that the Scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided My garments among them," and "they threw a lot for My garment." Then indeed the soldiers did these things. LXX-Psa. 21:19; MT-Psa. 22:18 )</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'> And His mother, and His mother's sister Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene stood by the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'> Then seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, Jesus said to His mother, Woman, behold your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'> Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother! And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'> After this, knowing that all things have now been finished that the Scripture be completed, Jesus said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'> Then a vessel full of vinegar was set, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop around, they brought it to His mouth. Psa. 69:21</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'> Then when Jesus took the vinegar, He said, It has been finished. And bowing His head, He delivered up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'> Then, since it was Preparation, that the bodies not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for great was the day of that sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and they be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'> Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'> But on coming to Jesus, when they saw He was dead already, they did not break His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'> But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a lance, and at once blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'> And the one seeing has borne witness and his witness is true; and that one knows that he speaks truly, that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'> For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken." Ex. 12:46; Psa. 34:20</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'> And again, a different Scripture says, "They shall look at Him whom they have pierced." Zech. 12:10</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'> And after these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave permission. Then he came and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'> And Nicodemus also came, the one coming at first to Jesus by night, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'> Then they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linens, with the spices, as is usual with the Jews in burying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'> And there was a garden in the place where He was crucified, and a new tomb in the garden, in which no one yet ever had been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'> There, then, because of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they put Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'> But on the first of the week, Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, darkness yet being on it . And she saw the stone had been removed from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'> Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they laid Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'> Then Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'> And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran in front more quickly than Peter and came first to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'> And stooping down, he saw the linens lying; however, he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'> Then Simon Peter came following him, and went into the tomb and saw the linens lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'> And the grave cloth which was on His head was not lying with the linens, but was wrapped up in one place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'> Therefore, then the other disciple also entered, he having come first to the tomb, even he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'> For they did not yet know the Scripture, that it was necessary for Him to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'> Then the disciples went away again to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'> But Mary stood outside at the tomb, weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped down into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'> And she saw two angels in white, sitting one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'> And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She said to them, Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'> And saying these things, she turned backward and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'> Jesus said to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Thinking that it was the gardener, she said to Him, Sir, if you carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'> Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning around, she said to Him, Rabboni! (that is to say, Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'> Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father. But go to My brothers and say to them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God, and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'> Mary Magdalene came bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He told her these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'> Then it being evening on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been locked where the disciples were assembled, because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'> And saying this, He showed them His hands and side. Then seeing the Lord, the disciples rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'> Then Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'> And saying this, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'> Of whomever you forgive the sins, they are forgiven to them. Or whomever you may retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'> But Thomas, one of the Twelve, the one called Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'> Then the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see the mark of the nails in His hands, and thrust my finger into the mark of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, in no way will I believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'> And after eight days, His disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. The door having been locked, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'> Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and thrust into My side, and be not unbelieving, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'> And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'> Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, Thomas, you have believed. Blessed are the ones not seeing and believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'> Then truly Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'> But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'> After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He revealed Himself this way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'> Simon Peter, and Thomas, being called The Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'> Simon Peter said to them, I am going out to fish. They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went and entered into the boat at once. And in that night, they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'> And it now becoming early morning, Jesus stood on the shore. However, the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'> Then Jesus said to them, Children, do you not have anything to eat? They answered Him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'> And He said to them, Cast the net into the right side of the boat and you will find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'> Then they cast, and they no longer had the strength to draw, from the multitude of the fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Then hearing that it is the Lord, Simon Peter girded on his  coat (for he was naked) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'> And the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'> Then when they went up on the land, they saw a coal fire lying, and a fish lying on it , and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'> Jesus said to them, Bring from the little fish which you caught now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'> Simon Peter went up and dragged the net onto the land, full of big fish, a hundred and fifty three. And though being so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'> Jesus said to them, Come, break fast. And no one of the disciples dared to ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'> Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave to them, and in the same way the little fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'> This now is the three times that Jesus was revealed to His disciples, He being raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'> Then when they broke fast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'> Again He says to him, secondly, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He says to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'> Thirdly, He said to him, Simon son of Jonah, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him a third time , Do you love Me? And he said to him, Lord, You perceive all things, You know that I love You! Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'> Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself, and you walked where you desired. But when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you, and will carry you where you do not desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'> But He said this signifying by what death he would glorify God. And having said this, He told him, Follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'> But turning, Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them , who also leaned on His breast at the Supper, and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'> Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, Lord, and what of this one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'> Jesus said to him, If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'> Therefore, the word went out to the brothers that that disciple does not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'> This is the disciple witnessing about these other things, writing these things, and we know that his witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'> And there are also many things, whatever Jesus did, which if they were written singly, I suppose the world itself could not contain the books having been written. Amen.</verse>
