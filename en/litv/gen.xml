        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'> and the earth being without form and empty, and darkness on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moving gently on the face of the waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'> then God said, Let light be! And there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'> And God saw the light, that it was good, and God separated between the light and darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'> And God called the light, Day. And He called the darkness, Night. And there was evening, and there was morning the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'> And God said, Let an expanse be in the midst of the waters, and let it divide between the waters and the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'> And God made the expanse, and He separated between the waters which were under the expanse and the waters which were above the expanse. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'> And God called the expanse, Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'> And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be collected to one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'> And God called the dry land, Earth. And He called the collection of the waters, Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'> And God said, Let the earth sprout tender sprouts, the plant seeding seed, the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whichever seed is in it on the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'> And the earth bore tender sprouts, the plant seeding seed according to its kind, and the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whichever seed is in it. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'> And there was evening, and there was morning the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'> And God said, Let luminaries be in the expanse of the heavens, to divide between the day and the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'> And let them be for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'> And God made the two great luminaries: the great luminary to rule the day, and the small luminary and the stars to rule the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'> And God set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'> and to rule over the day and over the night; and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'> And there was evening, and there was morning the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'> And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarmers having a soul of life; and let the birds fly over the earth, on the face of the expanse of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'> And God created the great sea animals, and all that creeps, having a living soul, which swarmed the waters, according to its kind; and every bird with wing according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; and let the birds multiply in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'> And there was evening, and there was morning the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the soul of life according to its kind: cattle, and creepers, and its beasts of the earth, according to its kind. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'> And God made the beasts of the earth according to its kind, and cattle according to its kind, and all creepers of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'> And God said, let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creepers creeping on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'> And God created the man in His own image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'> And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea, and over birds of the heavens, and over all beasts creeping on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'> And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant seeding seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree seeding seed; it shall be food for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'> And to every beast of the earth, and to all birds of the heavens, and to every creeper on the earth which has in it a living soul, every green plant is for food. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'> And God saw everything that He had made and behold, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'> And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'> And on the seventh day God completed His work which He had made And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'> And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because He rested from all His work on it, which God had created to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that Jehovah God was making earth and heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'> and every shrub of the field was not yet on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not sent rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'> And mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'> And Jehovah God formed the man out of dust from the ground, and blew into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'> And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden to the east; and He put the man whom He had formed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'> And out of the ground Jehovah God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. The Tree of Life was also in the middle of the garden; also the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'> The name of the first was Pishon; it is the one surrounding all the land of Havilah where gold is ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'> the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium gum resin, and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'> And the name of the second river is Gihon. It is the one surrounding all the land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'> And the name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one going east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'> And Jehovah God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden, to work it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'> And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree in the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'> but of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil you may not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'> And Jehovah God said, It is not good, the man being alone. I will make a helper suited to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'> And Jehovah God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the heavens out of the ground. And He brought them to the man, to see what he would call it. And all which the man might call it, each living soul, that  was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'> And the man called names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every animal of the field. But no helper suited to him was found for a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'> And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh underneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'> And Jehovah God formed the rib which He had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'> And the man said, This now at last is bone from my bones, and flesh from my flesh. For this shall be called Woman, because this has been taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'> Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'> And the serpent was cunning above every animal of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Is it true that God has said, You shall not eat from any tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'> And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'> but of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'> And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'> for God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'> And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and the tree was desirable to make one wise. And she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'> And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed leaves of the fig tree, and made girdles for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'> And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down in the garden at the breeze of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the middle of the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'> And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'> And he said, I have heard Your sound in the garden, and I was afraid, for I am naked, and I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'> And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'> And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she has given to me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'> And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'> And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all beasts, and above every animal of the field. You shall go on your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'> And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; He will bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'> He said to the woman, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your conception; you shall bear sons in sorrow, and your desire shall be toward your husband; and he shall rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'> And He said to the man, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat from it, the ground shall be cursed because of you; you shall eat of it in sorrow all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'> And it shall bring forth thorns and thistles for you, and you shall eat the plant of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'> By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until your return to the ground. For you have been taken out of it; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'> And the man called the name of his wife, Eve; because she became the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'> And Jehovah God made coats of skin for the man and his wife, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'> And Jehovah God said, Behold! The man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and also take from the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'> Jehovah God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground out of which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'> And He drove the man out. And He lodged the cherubs at the east of the Garden of Eden, and the flaming sword whirling around to guard the way of the Tree of Life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'> And the man knew his wife Eve. And she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'> And she continued to bear his brother, Abel. And Abel became a shepherd of flocks. And Cain became a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'> And in the end of days, it happened that Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'> And Abel brought, he also, from the firstlings of his flocks, even from their fat. And Jehovah looked to Abel and to his offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'> And He did not look to Cain and to his offering. And Cain glowed greatly with anger, and his face fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'> And Jehovah said to Cain, Why have you angrily glowed, and why has your face fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'> If you do well, is there not exaltation? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is toward you; but you should rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'> And Cain talked with his brother Abel. And it happened as they were in the field, Cain rose up against His brother Abel, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'> And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is your brother Abel? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'> And He said, What have you done? The voice of the blood of your brother cries to Me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'> And now you are cursed more than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'> When you till the ground, it will not again give its strength to you. You shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'> And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'> Behold! You have driven me out from the face of the earth today. And I shall be hidden from Your face. And I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth. And it will be that anyone who finds me shall kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'> And Jehovah said to him, If anyone kills Cain, he shall be avenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him should not kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'> And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah. And he lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and he called the name of the city according to the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'> And Irad was born to Enoch; and Irad fathered Mehujael And Mehujael fathered Methusael; and Methusael fathered Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'> And Lamech took two wives to himself: the name of the first was Adah; and the name of the second was Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'> And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those living in tents, and with cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'> And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the father of all those playing the harp and the organ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'> And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, the hammerer of every engraving tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'> And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech; listen to my words; for I have killed a man because of my wound, and a young man because of my hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'> For Cain is avenged sevenfold, and Lamech seventy seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'> And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son. And she called his name, Seth, for God has appointed to me another seed in place of Abel because Cain killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'> And a son was also born to Seth, and he called his name, Enos. Then it was begun to call on the name of Jehovah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.39.1'> And Joseph was carried down to Egypt. And Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh, the chief of the executioners, an Egyptian man, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had carried him down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.2'> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. And he was in the house of the Egyptian, his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.3'> And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and Joseph was prospering in his hand everything which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.4'> And Joseph fond favor in his sight, and served him. And he appointed him over his house, and he gave all he owned into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.5'> And it came about that from the time he appointed him over his house and over all he owned, Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of Jehovah was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.6'> And he left all he owned in Joseph's hand. And he did not know anything that he had, except the bread which he was eating. And Joseph was beautiful in form and beautiful of appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.7'> And after these things, it happened that his master's wife lifted up her eyes to Joseph, and said, Lie with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.8'> And he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master does not know what is in the house with me, and all that he owns he has given into my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.9'> No one in this house is greater than I, and he has not withheld anything from me except you, because you are his wife. And how should I do this great evil and sin against God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.10'> And it happened, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not listen to her, to lie beside her, to be with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.11'> And it happened on this day, that he went into the house to do his work. And none of the men of the house were there in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.12'> And she caught him by his robe, saying, Lie with me! And he left his robe in her hand and fled, and went outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.13'> And it happened, when she saw that he had left his robe in her hand, and had fled outside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.14'> She called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, Behold! He has brought to us a Hebrew man to mock at us. He came into me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.15'> And it happened when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, he left his robe by me and fled, and went outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.16'> And she kept his robe beside her until the coming of his master to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.17'> And she spoke these same words to him, saying, The Hebrew slave whom you brought in to us came in to me, to mock at me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.18'> And it happened at my raising my voice and crying out, he left his robe beside me and fled outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.19'> And it happened, when his master heard his wife's words which she spoke to him, saying, According to these words your slave did to me, his anger glowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.20'> And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison house the place where the king's prisoners were bound. And he was there in the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.21'> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and extended kindness to him. And He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.22'> And the warden of the prison house gave all the prisoners in the prison house into Joseph's hand. And all which they did there, he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.23'> There was no looking of the warden of the prison house to anything in his hand, in that Jehovah was with him, and Jehovah was prospering what he was doing.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.40'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.1'> And after these things, it happened, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.2'> And Pharaoh was angry against his two eunuchs, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.3'> And he gave them into custody, in the house of the chief of the executioners, into the prison house, the place where Joseph was bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.4'> And the chief of the executioners assigned Joseph to be with them, and he served them. And they were in custody many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.5'> And they dreamed a dream, both of them, each his dream in one night, each according to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker who belonged to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.6'> And Joseph came in to them in the morning. And he looked at them, and, behold, they were sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.7'> And he asked the eunuchs of Pharaoh who were with him in custody, in the house of his lord, saying, Why are your faces sad today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.8'> And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Now tell it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.9'> And the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.10'> And in the vine were three branches. And at its budding, it went up into blossom, its clusters ripened into grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.11'> And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into the cup of Pharaoh; and I gave the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.12'> And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation: the three branches, they are three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.13'> Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will return you to your place. And you will give the cup of Pharaoh into his hand according to the former custom when you were his cupbearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.14'> But make mention of me along with yourself, when it is well with you; and please do kindness with me and mention me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.15'> For truly I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have not done anything that they should have put me into the dungeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.16'> And the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good. And he said to Joseph, I also in my dream saw three baskets of white bread on my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.17'> And in the top basket some from all the food of Pharaoh, the work of a baker. And the birds were eating them from the basket off my head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.18'> And Joseph answered and said, This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.19'> Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh off you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.20'> And it happened, on the third day, the day of Pharaoh's birth, he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the midst of his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.21'> And he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his cupbearer office; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's palm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.22'> And he hanged the chief of the bakers, as Joseph interpreted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.23'> And the chief of the cupbearers did not mention Joseph, but forgot him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.41'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.1'> And it happened at the end of two years of days, Pharaoh was dreaming. And, lo, he was standing by the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.2'> And, behold! Seven cows were going up from the River, beautiful of appearance and fat of flesh; and they were eating in the reeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.3'> And, behold, seven other cows were going up after them from the River, evil of appearance and lean of flesh. And they were standing beside the cows on the lip of the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.4'> And the evil-appearing and leanfleshed cows were eating the seven cows of beautiful and fat appearance. And Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.5'> And he slept and dreamed a second time. And, behold, seven ears of grain were coming up on one stalk, fat and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.6'> And, behold, seven ears of grain, being lean and blasted by the east wind , sprouting forth after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.7'> And the seven lean ears were swallowing the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awakened; and, lo, it was a dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.8'> And it happened in the morning, his spirit was troubled. And he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dream, and there was no interpreter of them to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.9'> And the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, I mention my sin today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.10'> Pharaoh was angry against his servants, and gave me into custody in the house of the chief of the executioners, me and the chief of the bakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.11'> And we dreamed a dream in one night, he and I; we each dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.12'> And a Hebrew youth was with us, a slave to the chief of the executioners. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us; he interpreted to each according to his dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.13'> And it happened, as he had interpreted to us, so it was; he returned me to my place, and he hanged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.14'> And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they rushed him from the dungeon. And he shaved and changed his clothing and came in to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.15'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one to interpret it; and I have heard about you, saying, you hear a dream to interpret it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.16'> And Joseph replied to Pharaoh, saying, Not I! God will answer the welfare of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.17'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, lo, I was standing on the lip of the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.18'> And, behold, seven cows were going up from the River, fat of flesh and beautiful of form, and were feeding in the reeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.19'> And, behold, seven other cows were going up after them, poor and very evil of form, and lean of flesh; I have not seen any like them in all the land of Egypt for badness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.20'> And the cows, the lean and the evil, ate the first seven fat cows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'> And they went into their stomachs, and it could not be seen that they had gone into their stomachs; and their appearance was as evil as at the beginning. And I awakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.22'> And I looked in my dream. And, behold, seven ears of grain were coming up on one stalk, full and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.23'> And, behold, seven ears, withered, lean, blasted by the east wind , sprouting forth after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.24'> And the lean ears were swallowing the seven good ears. And I spoke to the magicians, but not one is making known the meaning to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.25'> And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one. God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.26'> The seven good cows, they are seven years and the seven good ears, they are seven years; it is one dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.27'> And the seven thin and evil-appearing cows going up after them, they are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted by the east wind will be seven years of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.28'> This is the word that I spoke to Pharaoh: what God is about to do, He has shown Pharaoh</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.29'> Behold! Seven years of great plenty are coming in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.30'> And seven years of famine will arise after them and all the plenty of the land of Egypt will be forgotten; and the famine will consume the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.31'> And the plenty in the land will not be remembered because of that famine afterwards; for it will be very severe</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'> And as to the dream being repeated to Pharaoh twice, the thing is settled because it is from God, and God is hastening to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'> And now let Pharaoh look for a man who is intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.34'> Let Pharaoh act and let him appoint rulers over the land and take a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.35'> And let then gather all the food of these coming good years. And let them heap up grain under Pharaoh's hand as food in the cities, ant let them keep it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'> And let the food be for a store for the land, for the seven years of famine which will be in the land of Egypt and let not the land be cut off by famine</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'> And the word was good in Pharaoh's eyes, and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.38'> And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find any man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.39'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has taught you all this, there is no one wise and intelligent like you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.40'> You shall be over my house, and at your mouth all my people shall kiss the hand . Only in respect to the throne will I be greater than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.41'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.42'> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on the hand of Joseph; and he clothed him with fine linen robes, and put a golden chain on his neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.43'> And he caused him to ride in a chariot which was the second to him. And they cried before him, Bow the knee! And he put him over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.44'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without a word from you not a man shall lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.45'> And Pharaoh called Joseph by the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. And He gave him Asenath the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, for a wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.46'> And Joseph was a son of thirty years as he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the face of Pharaoh and passed over in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.47'> And the land produced by handfuls in the seven years of plenty</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.48'> And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and he put food in the cities. The food of the field of the city which was around it, he put in the middle of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.49'> And Joseph heaped up grain like the sand of the sea, exceedingly much, until he ceased to count it, because it was without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.50'> And two sons were born to Joseph before the year of the famine came in, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, bore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.51'> And Joseph called the name of the first born Manasseh; for he said , God has made me forget all my toil, and all the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.52'> And the name of the second he called Ephraim; for he said , God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.53'> And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt were ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.54'> And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.55'> And all the land of Egypt hungered and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all Egypt, Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.56'> And the famine was on the face of all the land. And Joseph opened all which was in them, and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine was strong in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.57'> And all the earth came to Egypt to buy, to Joseph. For the famine was strong in all the earth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.42'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.1'> And Jacob saw that grain was in Egypt. And Jacob said to his sons, Why do you look at each other?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.2'> And he said, Behold! I have heard grain is in Egypt. Go down there and buy for us from there, that we may live and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.3'> And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.4'> And Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he said, Lest harm happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.5'> And among those coming, the sons of Israel came to buy. For the famine was in land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.6'> And Joseph was the potentate over the land, he selling to all the people of the earth. And Joseph's brothers came in and bowed to him, face down to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.7'> And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them; but he remained a stranger to them and spoke harsh things to them, and said to them, From where have you come? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.8'> And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.9'> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them. And he said to them, You are spies! You have come in to see the bareness of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.10'> And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.</verse>
