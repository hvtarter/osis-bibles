      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'> Since many took in hand to draw up an account concerning the matters having been borne out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'> as those from the beginning delivered to us, becoming eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'> it seemed good also to me, having traced out all things accurately from the first, to write in order to you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'> that you may know the certainty concerning the words which you were taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'> In the days of Herod the king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily course of Abijah. And his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'> And they were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'> And no child was born to them, because Elizabeth was barren. And both were advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'> And it happened in his serving as priest in the order of his course before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'> according to the custom of the priests, entering into the Holy Place of the Lord, it was Zacharias' lot to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'> And all the multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'> And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'> And seeing this , Zacharias was troubled, and fear fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'> But the angel said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias, because your prayer was heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'> And he will be joy and exultation to you, and many will rejoice over his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'> For he shall be great in the eyes of the Lord, and he shall not drink wine or strong drink. And he will be filled of the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'> And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'> And he will go out before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah "to turn the hearts of fathers to their children," and disobedient ones to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people having been prepared for the Lord. Mal. 4:5, 6</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'> And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am old and my wife is advanced in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'> And answering, the angel said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you the good news of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'> And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'> And the people were expecting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delay in the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'> But coming out, he was not able to speak to them, and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the Holy Place. And he was making signs to them and continued dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'> And it happened when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'> And after these days his wife Elizabeth conceived. And she hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'> So has the Lord done to me in the days in which He looked on me to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'> And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'> to a virgin who had been betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mariam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'> And entering, the angel said to her, Hail, one having received grace! The Lord is with you. You are blessed among women!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'> And seeing this , she was disturbed at his word, and considered what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'> And the angel said to her, Do not fear, Mariam, for you have found favor from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'> And behold! You will conceive in your womb and bear a Son, and you will call His name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'> This One will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'> And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'> But Mariam said to the angel, How will this be since I do not know a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'> And answering, the angel said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, and for this reason that Holy One being born of you will be called Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'> And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth! She also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'> for nothing shall be impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'> And Mariam said, Behold, the slave of the Lord! May it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'> And rising up in these days, Mariam went into the hill country with haste to a city of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'> And she entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'> And it happened, as Elizabeth heard Mariam's greeting, the babe in her womb leaped, and Elizabeth was filled of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'> And she cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'> And why is this to me that the mother of my Lord comes to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'> For behold, as the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped in exultation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'> And blessed is she believing, because there will be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'> And Mariam said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'> and my spirit exulted in God My Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'> For He looked upon the humiliation of His slave woman. For, behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed. 1 Sam. 1:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'> For the Mighty One did great things to me, and holy is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'> And His mercy is to generations of generations to those fearing Him. Psa. 103:17</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'> He performed mightily with His arm; He scattered proud ones in the thought of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'> He put down powerful ones from thrones, and exalted lowly ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'> He filled the hungry with good things, and He sent the rich away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'> He helped His servant Israel in order to remember mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'> even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'> And Mariam remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'> And the time was fulfilled to Elizabeth for her to bear, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'> And the neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'> And it happened on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child and were calling it by his father's name, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'> And his mother answered, saying, Not so, but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'> And they said to her, No one is among your kindred who is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'> And they signaled to his father, what he might desire him to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'> And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'> And instantly his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'> And fear came on all those living around them. And in all the hill country of Judea all these things were talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'> And all who heard laid them up in their hearts, saying, What then will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'> And his father Zacharias was filled of the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'> Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He visited and worked redemption for His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'> And He raised up a Horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'> even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from the age before :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'> Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all those hating us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'> to execute mercy with our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>  the oath which He swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'> to give to us, that we being delivered out of our enemies' hand, in order to serve Him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'> in consecration and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'> And you, child, will be called Prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, Mal. 3:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'> to give a knowledge of salvation to His people by remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'> through the tender bowels of mercy of our God, in which the Dayspring from on high will visit us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'> to appear to those sitting in darkness and in shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace. Isa. 9:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'> And the child grew, and became strong in spirit. And he was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'> And it happened in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the habitable world to be registered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'> This registration first occurred under the governing of Syria by Cyrenius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'> And all went to be registered, each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'> And Joseph also went from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'> to be registered with Mariam, she having been betrothed to him as wife, she being pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'> And it happened as they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'> And she bore her son, the First-born. And she wrapped Him and laid Him in the manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'> And shepherds were in the same country living in the fields and keeping guard over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'> And, behold, an angel of the Lord came on them. And the glory of the Lord shone around them. And they feared with a great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'> And the angel said to them, Do not fear. For, behold, I announce good news to you, a great joy, which will be to all people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'> because today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born to you in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'> And this is a sign to you: You will find a babe having been wrapped, lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'> Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, good will among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'> And it happened as the angels departed from them into the heaven, even the men, the shepherds, said to one another, Indeed, let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this thing which has occurred, which the Lord made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'> And hurrying, they came and sought out both Mariam and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'> And seeing, they publicly told about the word spoken to them about this Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'> And all those hearing marveled about the things spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'> And Mariam kept all these words, meditating in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they heard and saw, even as was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'> And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child His name was called Jesus, the name called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'> And when the days of her cleansing according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'> as it has been written in the Law of the Lord: Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord; Ex. 13:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'> and to offer a sacrifice according to that said in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two nestlings of doves. Lev. 12:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'> And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, eagerly expecting the Consolation of Israel. And the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'> And it happened to him, having been divinely instructed by the Holy Spirit, he was not to see death before he would see the Christ of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'> And by the Spirit he came into the temple. And as the parents were bringing in the child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the Law concerning Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'> even Simeon received Him into his arms. And he blessed God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'> Now, Master, You will let Your slave go in peace according to Your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'> because my eyes saw Your Salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'> which You prepared before the face of all the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'> a Light for revelation to the nations, and the Glory of Your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'> And Joseph was marveling, also His mother, at the things being said concerning Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'> And Simeon blessed them and said to His mother Mariam, Behold, this One is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'> yea, a sword also will pierce your own soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'> And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in many days, having lived seven years with a husband from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'> and she was a widow of eighty four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'> And coming on at the very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those in Jerusalem eagerly expecting redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'> And as they finished all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to Nazareth their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'> And the Child grew, and became strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'> And His parents went into Jerusalem year by year at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'> And when He was twelve years old , they, going up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the Feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'> and fulfilling the days, in their returning, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'> But supposing Him to be in the company, they went a day on the way. And they looked for Him among the relatives and friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'> And not finding Him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'> And it happened after three days they found Him in the temple sitting in the midst of the teachers, even hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'> And all those hearing Him were amazed at His intelligence and His answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'> And seeing Him, they were astounded. And His mother said to Him, Child, why did You do so to us? Behold, Your father and I were looking for You, greatly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'> And He said to them, Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be busy in the affairs of My Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'> And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'> And He went with them and came to Nazareth and was being subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these words in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'> And Jesus progressed in wisdom and stature and favor before God and men. see 1 Sam. 2:26</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'> And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate governing Judea, and Herod ruling as tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip ruling as tetrarch of Iturea and the Trachonitis country, and Lysanias ruling as tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'> upon the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came on John the son of Zacharias in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'> And he came into the neighborhood of the Jordan proclaiming a baptism of repentance for remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'> as it has been written in the roll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: " the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'> every valley shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made into straight, and the rough into smooth ways;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'> "and all flesh shall see the salvation of God." Isa. 40:35</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'> Then he said to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'> Then bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'> And also the axe is already laid to the root of the trees; therefore, every tree not producing good fruit is being cut down and being thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'> And the crowd asked him, saying, What then shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'> And answering, he said to them, The one that has two tunics, let him give to him that has not. And the one that has foods, let him do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'> And tax collectors also came to be baptized. And they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'> And he said to them, Continue to do no more than that commanded to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'> And also ones serving as soldiers asked him, saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Do not shake violently anyone nor accuse falsely, and be satisfied with your pay.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'> He is like a man building a house, who dug and deepened, and laid a foundation on the rock. And a flood having occurred, the stream burst against that house and could not shake it, for it had been founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'> But he who heard and did not perform, he is like a man having built his house on the earth without a foundation, on which the stream burst, and it immediately fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'> And when He had completed all His words in the ears of the people, He went into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'> And a certain slave of a centurion, one dear to him, having illness, was about to expire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'> And hearing about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that He might come to restore his slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'> And coming to Jesus, they earnestly begged Him, saying, He to whom You give this is worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'> For he loves our nation, and he built the synagogue for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'> And Jesus went with them. But He being yet not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble, for I am not worthy that You come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'> For this reason I did not count myself worthy to come to You. But say in a word, and let my servant be cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'> For I also am a man having been set under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to this one, Go! And he goes. And to another, Come! And he comes. And to my slave, Do this! And he does it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'> And hearing these things, Jesus marveled at him. And turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, I did not find such faith in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'> And those sent, returning to the house, found the sick slave well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'> And it happened on the next day, He went into a city being called Nain. And many of His disciples went with Him; also a great crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'> And as He drew near to the gate of the city, even behold, one having died was being borne, an only son born to his mother; and she was a widow. And a considerable crowd of the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'> And seeing her, the Lord felt pity over her and said to her, Stop weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'> And coming up, He touched the coffin; and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'> And the dead one sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'> And fear took hold of all; and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'> And this word about Him went out in all Judea, and in all the neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'> And His disciples reported to John about all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'> And having called near a certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Are You the One coming? Or should we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'> And having come to Him, the men said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the One coming, or should we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'> And in the same hour He healed many from diseases and plagues and evil spirits. And He gave to many blind ones ability to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'> And answering, Jesus said to them, Going, report to John what you saw and heard: "Blind ones see again;" "lame ones walk about;" "lepers are being cleansed; "deaf ones hear;" dead ones are raised; poor ones are given the gospel.  Isa. 35:5, 6; 61:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'> And blessed is he who is not offended in Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'> And John's messengers going away, He began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out to the wilderness to see? A reed being shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'> But what did you go out to see? A man who had been dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those in splendid clothing and being in luxury are in king's palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, even more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'> This is he about whom it has been written: "Behold, I send My messenger" before Your face, who "will prepare Your way before You." Mal. 3:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'> For I say to you, Among those born of a woman, no prophet is greater than John the Baptist. But the least one in the kingdom of God is greater than he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'> And all the people and the tax collectors hearing, they justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'> But the Pharisees and the lawyers set aside God's counsel as to themselves, not being baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'> And the Lord said, Then to what shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'> They are like children sitting in a market and calling to one another, and saying, We piped to you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'> For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'> The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'> But wisdom was justified from all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'> And a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him that He eat with him. And going into the Pharisee's house, He reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'> And, behold, a woman who was a sinner in the city, knowing that He reclined in the Pharisee's house, taking an alabaster vial of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'> and standing at His feet, weeping behind Him , she began to wash His feet with tears. And she was wiping with the hairs of her head. And she ardently kissed His feet and was anointing them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'> But seeing, the Pharisee who invited Him spoke within himself, saying, This one, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what the woman who touches him is ; for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'> And answering, Jesus said to the man, Simon, I have a thing to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'> There were two debtors to a certain creditor: the one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'> But they not having a thing to pay, he freely forgave both. Then which of them do you say will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'> And answering, Simon said, I suppose the one to whom he freely forgave the most. And He said to him, You have judged rightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'> And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give water for My feet, but she washed My feet with tears and wiped off with the hairs of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'> You gave Me no kiss, but she from when I entered did not stop fervently kissing My feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'> You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'> For this reason I say to you, her many sins are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'> And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'> And those reclining with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'> But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'> And it happened afterwards, even He traveled in every city and village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve were with Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'> also certain women who were healed from evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, having been called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'> and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to Him of their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'> And a great crowd coming together, and those in each city coming to Him, He spoke through a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'> The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the roadside and was trampled; and the birds of the heaven ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'> And other fell on the rock; and sprouting, it dried up because of not having moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'> And other fell in the midst of the thorns; and springing up with the thorns, they choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'> And other fell on the good ground; and springing up, it produced fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, He cried out, The one having ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'> And His disciples questioned Him, saying, What might this parable be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'> And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing, they might not understand. Isa. 6:9</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'> And this is the parable: The seed is the Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'> And those by the roadside are those who hear, then the Devil comes and takes away the Word from their heart, lest believing they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'> And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial draw back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'> And those falling in the thorns, these are those hearing, but under cares and riches and pleasures of life, having moved along, they are choked, and do not bear to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'> And those in the good ground, these are the ones who in a right and good heart, hearing the Word, they hold it and bear fruit in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'> But no one lighting a lamp covers it with a vessel, or puts it underneath a couch, but sets it on a lampstand, that those coming in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'> For nothing is hidden which will not be revealed, nor secret which will not be known and come to be revealed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'> And it was told to Him, saying Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wishing to see You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'> And answering, He said to them, My mother and My brothers are these: the ones hearing the Word of God, and doing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'> And it happened on one of the days that He and His disciples entered into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they put out to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'> And as they sailed He fell asleep. And a storm of wind came onto the lake, and they were being filled and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'> And coming up they awakened Him, saying, Master! Master! We are perishing! And being aroused, He rebuked the wind and the roughness of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'> And He said to them, Where is your faith? And being afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this One, that He commands even the wind and the water, and they obey Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'> And they sailed down to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'> And He going out onto the land, a certain man out of the city met Him, who had demons from a long time. (And he put no garment on; and he did not stay in a house, but among the tombs).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'> And seeing Jesus, and crying out, he fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, What to me and to You, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I beg You, do not torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'> For He charged the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was bound with chains and fetters, being guarded. And tearing apart the bonds, he was driven by the demons into the deserted places .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion (because many demons entered into him).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'> And they begged Him that He not order them to go away into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'> And there was a herd of many pigs feeding there in the mount. And they begged Him that He would allow them to enter into those. And He allowed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'> And coming out from the man, the demons entered into the pigs; and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and was choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'> And seeing the thing, those feeding the pigs fled. And leaving, they reported to the city and to the farms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'> And they went out to see the thing happening, and came to Jesus. And they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and of sound mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'> And those seeing also related to them how the demon-possessed one was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'> And all the multitude of the neighborhood of the Gadarenes were seized with a great fear. And they asked Him to depart from them. And entering into the boat, He returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'> And the man from whom the demons had gone out begged Him, desiring to be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'> Go back to your house and tell what God did to you. And he went away proclaiming through all the city what things Jesus did to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'> And it happened as Jesus returned, the crowd gladly received Him, for they were all waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'> And, behold, a man named Jairus came, and this one was a synagogue ruler. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged Him to come into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'> because an only daughter was born to him, about twelve years old ; and she was dying. And in His going, the crowd pressed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'> And a woman being in a flow of blood from twelve years, who had spent her whole living on physicians, and could not be cured by anyone,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'> And Jesus said, Who was touching Me? And all having denied, Peter and those with Him said, Master, the crowds press on You and jostle. And do You say, Who was touching Me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'> And seeing that she was not hidden, the woman came trembling and kneeled down before Him and told Him before all the people for what reason she touched Him, and how she was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'> And He said to her, Daughter, be comforted. Your faith has healed you. Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'> As He was yet speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler, saying to him, Your daughter has expired. Do not trouble the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'> But hearing, Jesus answered him, saying, Do not fear; only believe and she will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'> And coming into the house, He did not allow anyone to enter, except Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'> And all were weeping and bewailing her. But He said, Stop weeping. She has not died, but is sleeping.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'> And He also spoke this parable to some of those relying on themselves, that they are righteous, and despising the rest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'> Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'> And when they came on the place being called Skull, they crucified Him and the criminals there, one on the right, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast a lot. Psa. 22:18</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'> And the people stood watching. And the rulers with them also scoffed, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this one is the Christ, the elect of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'> And coming near, the soldiers also mocked Him and were offering vinegar to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'> and saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'> And also an inscription was written over Him, in Greek and Latin and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'> And one of the hanged criminals blasphemed Him, saying, If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'> But answering, the other rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, for you are in the same judgment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'> And we indeed justly, for we receive things worthy of what we did. But this One did nothing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'> And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'> And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'> And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the Holy Place was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'> And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, "into Your hands I commit My spirit." And saying this, He breathed out the spirit. Psa. 31:5</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'> And all the crowd arriving together at this sight, watching the thing happening, beating their breasts, they returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'> And all those known to Him stood at a distance, and the women, those who accompanied Him from Galilee, were seeing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'> And, behold, a man named Joseph, being a councillor, a good and righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'> This one was not assenting to their counsel and deed ( he was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews), and who himself was eagerly expecting the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'> coming near to Pilate, this one asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'> And taking it down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed it in a quarried tomb, where no one was ever yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'> And it was Preparation Day, and a sabbath was coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'> And also women were following, who were accompanying Him out of Galilee, who watched the tomb, and how His body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'> And returning, they prepared spices and ointment. And indeed they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'> But on the first of the sabbaths, while still very early, they came on the tomb, carrying spices which they prepared; and some were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'> And they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'> And going in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'> And it happened, as they were perplexed about this, even behold, two men in shining clothing stood by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'> And they becoming terrified, and bowing their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living with the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'> He is not here, but was raised. Remember how He spoke to you, yet being in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'> saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'> And they remembered His words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'> And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'> And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary mother of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'> And their words seemed like foolishness to them, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'> But rising up, Peter ran to the tomb, and stooping down he saw the linen lying alone. And he went away wondering to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'> And, behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village being sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem, which was named Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'> And they talked to each other about all these things taking place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'> And it happened, as they talked and reasoned, coming near, Jesus Himself traveled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'> But their eyes were held so as not to recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'> And He said to them, What words are these which you exchange with each other while walking, and are sad of face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'> And answering, one of them whose name was Cleopas, said to Him, Are you only one who resides in Jerusalem and do not know the things happening in it in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'> And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to the judgment of death, and crucified Him .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'> But we were hoping that He is the One going to redeem Israel. But then with all these things, this third day comes today since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'> And also some of our women astounded us, having been early at the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'> and not finding His body, they came saying to have seen a vision of angels also, who say Him to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'> And some of those with us went to the tomb, and found it so , even as the women also said; but they did not see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'> And He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe on all things which the prophets spoke!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'> Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into His glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'> And beginning from Moses, and from all the prophets, He explained to them the things about Himself in all the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'> And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He seemed to be going further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'> And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day has declined. And He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'> And it happened as He reclined with them, taking the loaf, He blessed, and breaking He gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'> And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him. And He became invisible from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'> And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as He spoke to us in the highway, and as He opened up to us the Scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'> And rising up in the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem, and they found the Eleven, and those with them, having been gathered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'> saying, The Lord really was raised and appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'> And they related the things in the highway, and how He was known to them in the breaking of the loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'> And as they were telling these things, Jesus Himself stood in their midst, and said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'> But being terrified and filled with fear, they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'> And He said to them, Why are you troubled? And why do reasonings come up in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'> See My hands and My feet, that I am He? Feel Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see Me having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'> And saying this, He showed them His hands and feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'> But yet they not believing from the joy, and marveling, He said to them, Have you any food here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'> And they handed a broiled part of a fish to Him, and from a honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'> And taking these before them, He ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'> And He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you yet being with you, that must be fulfilled all the things having been written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'> Then He opened up their mind to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'> and said to them, So it is written, and so the Christ must suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day. No OT passage</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'> And repentance and remission of sins must be preached on His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'> And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'> And, behold, I send forth the promise of My Father on you. But you sit in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'> He led them out as far as to Bethany. And lifting up His hands, He blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'> And it happened as He blessed them, He withdrew from them and was carried into Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'> And worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'> and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
