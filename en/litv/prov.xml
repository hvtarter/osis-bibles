        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'> The of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'> To know wisdom and instruction; to understand the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'> to receive instruction in prudence, justice, and judgment, and uprightness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'> to give sense to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'> The wise hears and increases learning, and the understanding ones gets wise counsel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'> to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their acute sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'> The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'> My son, hear your father's instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'> for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains for your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'> My son, if sinners lure you, do not be willing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'> If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us secretly lurk for the innocent without cause,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'> let us swallow them up alive as Sheol; and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'> we shall find all precious goods; we shall fill our houses with plunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'> cast in your lot among us; one purse shall be to all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'> My son, do not walk in the way with them! Hold back your foot from their path;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'> for their feet run to evil and they haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'> For in vain the net is spread in the sight of every bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'> And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'> So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away its owner's soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'> Wisdom cries aloud outside; she gives her voice in the square;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'> she calls at the head of gathering places; in the opening of the gates, in the city she utters her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'> How long will you love to be simple, you simple ones? And will scorners desire scorn for themselves? And will fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'> Turn back at my warning; behold, I will pour out my Spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'> Because I called, and you refused; I stretch out a hand, and none inclines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'> but you have ignored all my counsel, and you did not desire my warning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'> I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your dread comes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'> when your dread comes like a storm; and your calamity arrives like a tempest, when distress and constraint come on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'> Then they shall call on me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'> Instead they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'> They did not want my counsel; they despised all my reproof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'> and they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'> For the going astray of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'> But he who listens to me shall live securely and shall be at ease from the dread of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'> My son, if you will receive My words, and treasure up My commandments with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'> so that you attend to wisdom, you shall extend your heart to understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'> For if you cry for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'> if you seek her as silver, and search for her as hidden treasures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'> then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah and find knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'> For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth are knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to the ones who walk in integrity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'> to guard the paths of judgment, and He protects the way of His saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'> Then you shall understand righteousness and judgment and honesty, yea , every good path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.10'> When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasing to your soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'> discretion shall keep you, understanding shall watch over you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'> to deliver you from the evil way, from the man who speaks perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'> those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'> who rejoice to do evil; they delight in the perversities of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'> whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>  These will deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'> who forsakes the guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'> For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'> All going in to her do not return, nor do they reach the ways of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'> Then you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'> For the upright shall live in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'> Mercy and truth will not forsake you; tie them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'> and you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'> Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'> In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'> Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'> Healing shall be to your navel and marrow to your bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'> Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'> she is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'> Length of days is in her right hand; riches and honor in her left hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'> She is a tree of life to the ones who lay hold on her; and happy are the ones holding her fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'> Jehovah founded the earth by wisdom; He founded the heavens by understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'> the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds dropped down the dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'> My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'> and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'> then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'> When you lie down, you shall not dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'> Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'> For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'> Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'> Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, or, Tomorrow I will give, when you have it beside you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.29'> Do not plan evil against your neighbor, since he lives securely by you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.31'> Do not envy the cruel man, and choose not among all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.32'> For the perverse one is hateful to Jehovah, but His intimacy is with the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.33'> The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.34'> Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.35'> The wise inherit honor, but the foolish exalt shame.</verse>
