      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'> James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion, greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'> My brothers count it all joy when you fall into various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'> knowing that the proving of your faith works patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'> But let patience have its perfective work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'> But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask from God, who gives to all freely and with no reproach, and it will be given to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'> But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, being driven by wind and being tossed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'> for do not let that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>  he is a double-souled man, not dependable in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'> But let the lowly brother rejoice in his lifting up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'> and the rich one rejoice in his humiliation, because he will pass away like the flower of the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'> For the sun rose with the hot wind and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the beauty of its appearance perished; so also the rich one will fade away in his ways. Isa. 40:6, 7</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'> Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because having been approved he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to the ones loving Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'> Let no one being tempted say, I am tempted from God. For God is not tempted by evils, and He tempts no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'> But each one is tempted by his own lusts, having been drawn out and having been seduced by them .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'> Then being conceived, lust brings forth sin. And sin being fully formed brings forth death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'> Do not go astray, my beloved brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'> every act of good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no change or shadow of turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'> Having purposed, He brought us forth by the word of truth, for us to be a certain firstfruit of His creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'> So that, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'> For the wrath of man does not work out the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'> On account of this, having put aside all filthiness and overflowing of evil, in meekness receive the implanted Word being able to save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'> But become doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'> Because if anyone is a hearer of the Word, and not a doer, this one is like a man studying his natural face in a mirror;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'> for he studied himself, and has gone away, and immediately he forgot of what kind he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'> But the one looking into the perfect law of liberty, and continuing in it , this one not having become a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'> If anyone thinks to be religious among you, yet not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, this one's religion is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'> My brothers, do not with respect of persons have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'> For if a gold-fingered man in splendid clothing comes into your synagogue, and a poor one in shabby clothing also comes in;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'> and you look on the one wearing the splendid clothing, and say to him, You sit here comfortably; and to the poor one you say, You stand there, or, Sit here under my footstool;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'> did you not also make a difference among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'> Hear, my beloved brothers, did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to the ones loving Him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'> But you dishonored the poor one. Do not the rich ones oppress you, and they drag you to judgment seats?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'> Do they not blaspheme the good Name called on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'> If you truly fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well. Lev. 19:18</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'> But if you have partiality to persons, you work sin, having been found guilty as transgressors by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'> For whoever shall keep all the law, but stumbles in one, he has become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'> For He who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You shall not murder." Ex. 20:14, 13; Deut. 5:18, 17 But if you do not commit adultery, but commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'> So speak and so do as being about to be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'> For judgment will be without mercy to the one not doing mercy. And mercy rejoices over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'> My brothers, what is the gain if anyone says he has faith, but he does not have works? Is faith able to save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'> But if a brother or a sister is naked and may be lacking in daily food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'> and any one of you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, but does not give them the things the body needs, what gain is it ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'> So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'> But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith out of my works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'> You believe that God is one. You do well; even the demons believe and shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'> But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'> Was not our father Abraham justified by works offering up his son Isaac on the altar? Gen. 22:9</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'> You see that faith worked with his works; and out of the works the faith was made perfected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'> And the Scripture was fulfilled, saying, "And Abraham believed God, and it was counted for righteousness to him;" and he was called, Friend of God. Gen. 15:6; Isa. 41:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'> You see, then, that a man is justified out of works, and not out of faith only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'> But in the same way Rahab the harlot was also justified out of works, having received the messengers, and sending them out by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'> For as the body is dead apart from the spirit, so also faith is dead apart from works.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'> My brothers do not be many teachers, knowing that we will receive greater judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'> For we all stumble in many ways . If any one does not stumble in word, this one is a mature man, able also to bridle the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'> Behold, we put bits in the mouths of the horses, for them to obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'> Behold, the ships also, being so great, and being driven by violent winds, they are directed by a very small rudder, where the impulse of the one steering purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'> So also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how little a fire kindles how large a forest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'> And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. So the tongue is set among our members, spotting all the body, and inflaming the course of nature, and having been inflamed by Hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'> For every species of beasts, both indeed of birds, of creeping things, and of sea animals, is tamed, and has been tamed by the human species ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'> but no one of men is able to tame the tongue; it is an evil that cannot be restrained, full of death-dealing poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'> By this we bless God and the Father; and by this we curse men having come into being according to the image of God. Gen. 1:26</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'> Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers it is not fitting for these things to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>  Does the fountain out of the same hole send forth the sweet and the bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'> My brothers, a fig tree is not able to produce olives, or a vine figs. So neither can a fountain produce both salt and sweet water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'> Who is wise and knowing among you? Let him show his works by his good behavior, in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'> But if you have bitter jealousy and contention in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'> This is not the wisdom coming down from above, but is earthly, beastly, devilish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'> For where jealousy and contention are , there is confusion and every foul deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'> But the wisdom from above is firstly truly pure, then peaceable, forbearing, yielding, full of mercy and of good fruits, not partial and not pretended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for the ones making peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'> From where do wars and fightings among you come ? Is it not from this, from your lusts warring in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'> You desire greatly and do not have. You murder, and are jealous, and are not able to obtain. You fight and you war, and you do not have, because you do not ask God .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'> You ask, and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, in order that you may spend on your lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'> Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever, then, purposes to be a friend of the world is shown to be an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'> Or do you think that vainly the Scripture says, The spirit which has dwelt in us yearns to envy? No OT passage</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'> But He gives greater grace. Because of this it says, "God sets Himself against proud ones, but He gives grace to humble ones." Prov. 3:34</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'> Then be subject to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'> Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners! And purify your hearts, double minded ones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'> Be distressed, and mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'> Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'> Do not speak against one another, brothers. He that speaks against a brother, and is judging a brother, he speaks against law, and judges law. But if you judge law, you are not a doer of law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'> One is the Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you who judges another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'> Come now, those saying, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and we will spend one year there, and we will trade and will make a profit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'> who do not know of the morrow. For what is your life? For it is a mist, which for a little while appears, and then disappears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'> Instead of you saying, If the Lord wills, even we will live, and we will do this or that;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'> but now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'> Therefore, to anyone knowing to do good, and not doing it , it is sin to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'> Come now, rich ones, weep, howling over your hardships coming on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'> Your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'> Your gold and silver have rusted over, and their poison will be a testimony to you, and will eat your flesh as fire. You heaped treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'> Behold, the wages of the workmen who have reaped your fields cry out, being kept back by you. And the cries of the ones who have reaped have entered "into the ears of the Lord of Hosts." Isa. 5:9</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'> You lived luxuriously on the earth, and lived in self gratification; you nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'> you condemned; you murdered the righteous; he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'> Therefore, brothers, be long-suffering until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being long-suffering over it until it may receive the early and the latter rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'> You also be long-suffering. Set your hearts firmly, because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'> Do not murmur against one another, brothers, that you not be condemned. Behold, the Judge stands before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'> My brothers, as an example of suffering ill, and of longsuffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'> Behold, we call those blessed who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you saw the end of the Lord, "that the Lord is full of tender mercy and pity." Psa. 103:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'> But before all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and the no, no, that you may not fall under judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'> Does anyone suffer ill among you? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him praise in song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'> Is any among you sick? Let him call the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'> And the prayer of faith will cure those being sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he may have committed sin, it will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'> Confess faults to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous one has great strength, having been made effective.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'> Elijah was a man of like feeling to us, and he prayed in prayer for it not to rain; and it did not rain on the earth three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'> And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to sprout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'> If anyone among you goes astray from the truth, brothers, and anyone turns him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'> know that the one turning a sinner from the error of his way will save the soul from death, and will hide a multitude of sins.</verse>
