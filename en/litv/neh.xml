      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'> The words of the son of Hachaliah. And it happened in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'> Hanani came, one of my brothers, he and men of Judah. And I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and about Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'> And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great evil and shame. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'> And it happened, when I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'> And I said, I beseech You, Jehovah God of Heaven, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and mercy to those loving Him, and to keepers of His commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'> let Your ear now be open, and Your eyes open, so that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You today, day and night, for Your servants the sons of Israel; and confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'> We have acted utterly corrupt against You, and have not kept the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which You commanded Your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'> I beseech You, remember the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, If you sin, I will scatter you among the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'> But if you will turn to Me and keep My commandments, and do them, though you were cast out to the outermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to set My name there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'> And these are Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'> O Lord, I beg You, let Your ear be open to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your name. And I beg You, bless Your servant today and grant him mercy before this man. For I was cupbearer to the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'> And it happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him. And I took the wine and gave to the king. And I had never been sad to his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'> And the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'> And I said to the king, let the king live forever. Why should not my face be sad when the place of my fathers' tombs, the City, lies waste and its gates are burned with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'> Then the king said to me, For what do you ask? So I prayed to the God of Heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'> and I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judah to the city of my fathers' tombs, so that I might build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'> And the king said to me, the queen also sitting beside him, For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king, and he sent me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'> An I said to the king, If it is good to the king, let letters be given me to the governors Beyond the River, so that they may let me go through until I come to Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'> also a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, so that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which is for the house, and for the city wall, and for the house into which I shall enter. And the king granted it to me, according to the good hand of my God on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'> Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent army commanders and horsemen with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'> And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, heard. And it grieved them greatly that a man had come to seek the good of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'> So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'> And I rose up in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem. And there was no animal with me except the animal that I rode on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'> And I went out by night by the Valley Gate, even before the Jackal Fountain, and to the Dung Gate. And I examined the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and its gates which were burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'> Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate, and to the King's Pool. But there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'> Then I went up in the night by the torrent, and examined the wall, and turned back, and entered by the Valley Gate, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'> And the rulers did not know where I had gone, or what I was doing. Nor had I told it yet to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the rulers, or to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'> Then I said to them, You see the evil that we are in, how Jerusalem is wasted, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me, and also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they made their hands strong for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'> But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard, then they mocked us and despised us. And they said, What is this that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'> Then I answered them and said to them, The God of Heaven, He will prosper us, and we His servants will arise and build. But you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'> And it happened, when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry, and it was greatly enraging to him, and he mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'> And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they forsake themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day? Will they bring to life the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'> And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox goes up, he will even break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'> O our God, hear. For we are despised. And turn their curse on their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'> And do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You. For they have provoked You to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'> So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to the half of it. For the people had a heart to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'> And it happened, when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that repairing of the walls of Jerusalem had gone up, that the breaks were being closed up, it was very angering to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'> And all of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and do harm to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'> But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'> And Judah said, The strength of the burden carriers is weakening, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'> And our foes have said, They shall not know or see until we come in the middle of them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'> And it happened when the Jews who lived near them came in, they said to us ten times, From all places where you shall return, they will be against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'> So I stationed from the lowest parts of the place, from the back of the wall, in the higher places, even I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'> And I saw. And I rose up and said to the nobles and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'> And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had broken their counsel, all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'> And it happened, from that time on, half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them were holding the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the scale-armor. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'> the ones who built on the wall, and the ones who carried a burden, bearing with one of his hands, a worker in the work; and one holder of the weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'> For each man of the builders had his sword tied by his side, and built. And he who sounded the ram's horn was beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'> And I said to the nobles and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'> In whatever place you hear the sound of the ram's horn, gather there to us. Our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'> So we labored in the work. And half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'> Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let each man with his servant stay inside Jerusalem, so that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'> So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, though each had his vessel of water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'> And there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives, against their brothers the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'> For some were saying, With our sons and our daughters, we are many. let us take up grain for them, so that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>  Some also were saying, We have mortgaged our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses; let us take up grain because of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'> And some were saying, We have borrowed silver for the king's tax, on our fields, and our vineyards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'> yet now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers; as their sons, so are our sons; and, behold, we are bringing our sons and our daughters into bondage, to be slaves; yea, there are some of our daughters brought into bondage. And there is no power for our hand, and our fields and our vineyards are to other men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'> And when I heard their cry, and these words, I was very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'> Then my heart ruled within myself, and I contended with the nobles and the magistrates. And I said to them, You are each man lending at interest, from his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'> And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers, the Jews who were sold to the nations. And will you yet sell your brothers? Or shall they be sold to us? Then they were silent, and did not find a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'> Also I said, The thing you do is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'> Likewise, my brothers and my servants are lending them silver and grain. I beg you, let us leave off this interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'> I beg you, even today give back to them their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses; also the hundredth part of their silver, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that you have taken from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'> And they said, We will restore, and will ask nothing from them. So we will do as you say. Then I called the priests and took an oath from them that they would do according to this word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'> Also I shook my lap, and I said, So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not do this thing; even may he be shaken out this way and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'> And from the time that I was chosen to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brothers did not eat the bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'> The former governors that had been before me were too heavy on the people, and had taken bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not do this, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'> Yea, I also was strong in the work of this wall, nor did we buy a field. And all my servants were gathered there to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'> And at my table were a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from among the nations around us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'> And that which was prepared for me daily was one ox, six fat sheep. Also birds were prepared for me; and between ten days, in all of the wine plentifully. And with this I did not seek the bread of the governor, for the bondage was heavy on this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'> Think upon me for good, my God, according to all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'> And it happened, when it was heard by Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that no break was left in it though at that time I had not set up doors on the gates,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'> Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do evil to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'> And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'> And they sent to me four times in this way. And I answered them in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, in which was written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'> It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says, you and the Jews are thinking of rebelling; for which reason you are building the wall, so that you may be a king to them, according to these words.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'> And it happened, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, so that there should be no burden brought in on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'> And the merchants and sellers of all the wares stayed the night outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'> Then I testified against them and said to them, Why are you staying around the wall? If you do it again, I will send a hand against you. From that time they did not come on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'> And I commanded the Levites that they should be cleansing themselves, and they should come guarding the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. O my God, remember me for this also and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'> In those days I also saw Jews who had dwelt with women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'> And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and to them there was no respecting to speak Jewish, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'> And I contended with them, and put a curse on them, and struck some of them, and I plucked their hair. And I made them swear by the name of God, saying, You shall not give your daughter to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved by his God; and God made him king over Israel. But women from other lands caused even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'> Shall we then listen to you, to do this great evil, to sin against our God in living with foreign women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'> And I cleansed them from all aliens, and appointed watches to the priests and the Levites, each one in his business,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'> and for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</verse>
