      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the word of Jehovah came by the prophet to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah; and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'> So speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'> And the word of Jehovah was by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>  Is it time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses, and this house to lie waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'> And now, so says Jehovah of hosts: Set your heart on your ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'> You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but are not satisfied; you drink, but not to be filled; you dress, but there is no warmth to one. Yea, he who sells himself sells himself for a bag of holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'> So says Jehovah of hosts: Set your heart on your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'> Go up the mountain and bring wood and build this house. And I will be pleased with it, and I will be glorified, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>  You looked for much, and, behold, little! And when you brought it home, then I blew on it. Why, declares Jehovah of hosts? Because of My house that is ruined, and you, each man, run to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'> On account of this, the heavens above you have held back the dew, and the earth is held back from her produce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'> And I called for a drought in the land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground produces, and on man, and on livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'> Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him. And the people feared before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'> And Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, spoke the message of Jehovah to the people, saying, I am with you, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'> And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'> in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'> In the seventh month , on the twenty-first of the month, the word of Jehovah was by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'> Now speak to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'> Who is left among you who saw this house in her former glory? And how do you see it now? When compared to it, is it not as nothing in your eyes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'> Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Jehovah. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong and work, all people of the land, says Jehovah. For I am with you, declares Jehovah of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>  with the Word by whom I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit remains among you; do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'> For so says Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'> And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'> The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'> The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says Jehovah of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'> In the twenty-fourth of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'> So says Jehovah of hosts: Now ask the priests the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'> Behold, one bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches his skirt to the bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'> And said, If the unclean of body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'> And answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before Me, declares Jehovah. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'> And now, I ask you, set your heart on it; from this day and onward: before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'> from then onward, one came to a heap of twenty measures , and there were but ten. One came to the wine vat to draw out fifty from the wine trough, and there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'> I struck you with blight, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not turn to Me, says Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'> Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month , from the day that Jehovah's temple was established. Set your heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>  Is the seed still in the barn? Yes, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless them .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'> And a second time the word of Jehovah was to Haggai, in the twenty-fourth of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'> Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'> And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will come down, each one by the sword of his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'> In that day, says Jehovah of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says Jehovah, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
