      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'> In many parts and in many ways of old, God spoke to the fathers in the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'> in these last days He spoke to us in the Son, whom He appointed heir of all; through whom He indeed made the ages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'> who being the shining splendor of His glory, and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the word of His power, having made purification of our sins through Himself, He sat down on the right of the Majesty on high, Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'> having become so much better than the angels, He has inherited a name more excellent than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'> For to which of the angels did He ever say, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me." Psa. 2:7; 2 Sam. 7:16</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'> And again, when He brought the First-born into the world, He said, "And let all the angels of God worship Him." LXX-Deut. 32:43, MT-No Equiv</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'> And as to the angels, He said, "Who makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;" LXX-Psa. 103:4; MT-Psa. 104:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'> but as to the Son, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'> You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness beside Your fellows." Psa. 45:6, 7</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'> And, "You, Lord, at the beginning founded the earth, and the heavens are works of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'> They will vanish away, but You will continue; and they will all become old, like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'> and You shall fold them up like a covering, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail." LXX-Psa. 101:26-28, MT-Psa. 102:25-27</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'> But to which of the angels did He ever say, "Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies as a footstool of Your feet?" LXX-Psa. 109:1, MT-Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'> Are they not all ministering spirits for service, being sent out because of the ones being about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'> For this reason we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things heard, that we should not slip away at any time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'> For if the word spoken by angels was confirmed, and every transgression and disobedience received a just repayment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'> how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? Which having received a beginning to be spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by the ones hearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'> God bearing witness with them by both miracles and wonders, and by various works of power, even by distribution of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'> For He did not put the coming world under angels, about which we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'> but one fully testified somewhere, saying, "What is man, that You are mindful of him; or the son of man, that You look upon him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'> You made him a little less than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor; and You set him over the works of Your hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'> You put all things under his feet." Psa. 8:4 -6 For in putting all things under him, He left nothing not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see all things being subjected to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'> but we do see Jesus crowned with glory and honor, who on account of the suffering of death was made a little less than the angels, so that by the grace of God He might taste of death for every son .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'> For it was fitting for Him, because of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, bringing many sons to glory, to perfect Him as the Author of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'> For both He sanctifying and the ones being sanctified are all of one; for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'> saying, I will announce Your name to My brothers; I will hymn to You in the midst of the assembly." Psa. 22:22</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'> And again, "I will be trusting on Him." Isa. 8:17 And again, "Behold, I and the children whom God gave to Me." Isa. 8:18</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'> Since, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, in like manner He Himself also shared the same things, that through death He might cause to cease the one having the power of death, (that is, the Devil);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'> and might set these free, as many as by fear of death were subject to slavery through all the time to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'> For indeed He does not take hold of angels, "but He takes hold of" " the seed of Abraham." Isa. 41:8, 9</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'> For this reason He ought by all means to become like His brothers, that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things respecting God, in order to make propitiation for the sins of His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'> For in what He has suffered, being tried, He is able to help those having been tried.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'> For this reason, holy brothers, called to be partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'> "being faithful" to Him who appointed Him, as also "Moses" "in all his house." Num. 12:7</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'> For He was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as the one having built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'> For every house is built by someone; but He who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'> And "Moses" truly " was faithful in all his house" as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things having been spoken; Num. 12:7</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'> but Christ as Son over His house, whose house we are, if truly we hold fast the boldness and rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'> Because of this, even as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'> do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'> there where your fathers tempted Me, testing Me, and saw My works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'> Because of this, I was angry with that generation and said, They always go astray in heart; and they did not know My ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'> so I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest." LXX-Psa. 94:7-11; MT-Psa. 95:7-11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'> Watch, brothers, lest perhaps shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'> But exhort yourselves each day, as long as it is being called today, that not any of you be hardened by the deceit of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'> For we have become partakers of Christ, if truly we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'> as in the saying, "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation." LXX-Psa. 94:7, 8; MT-Psa. 95:7, 8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'> For hearing, some provoked Him , but not all those coming out of Egypt through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'> But with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with the ones sinning, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'> And to whom did "He swear" " they would not enter into His rest," except to those not obeying? LXX-Psa. 94:11; MT-Psa. 95:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'> And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'> Then let us fear lest in any way a promise having been left to enter into His rest, that any of you may seem to come short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'> For, indeed, we have had the gospel preached to us , even as they also; but the word did not profit those hearing it , not having been mixed with faith in the ones who heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'> For we, the ones believing, enter into the rest, even as He said, "As I swore in My wrath, they shall not enter into My rest," though the works had come into being from the foundation of the world. LXX-Psa. 94:11, MT-Psa. 95:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'> For He has spoken somewhere about the seventh day this way, "And God rested from all His works in the seventh day." Gen. 2:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'> And in this place again, "They shall not enter into My rest." LXX-Psa. 94:11; MT-Psa. 95:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'> Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those who formerly had the gospel preached did not enter in on account of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'> He again marks out a certain day, saying in David, Today (after so long a time, according as He has said), "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts." LXX-Psa. 94:7, 8; MT-Psa. 95:7, 8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'> For if Joshua gave them rest, then He would not have afterwards spoken about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'> So, then, there remains a sabbath rest to the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'> For he entering into His rest, he himself also rested from His works, as God had rested from His own. LXX-Psa. 95:11, Gen. 2:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'> Therefore, let us exert ourselves to enter into that rest, that not anyone fall in the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'> For the word of God is living, and powerfully working, and sharper than every two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of both soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge of the thoughts and intentions of the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'> and there is no creature unrevealed before Him; but all things are naked and laid open to His eyes, with whom is our account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'> Then having a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'> For we do not have a high priest not being able to sympathize with our weaknesses but One having been tried in all respects according to our likeness, apart from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'> Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and we may find grace for help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'> For every high priest being taken from men is appointed on behalf of men in the things respecting God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'> being able to feel in due measure for those not knowing and having been led astray, since he also is circled about with weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'> And because of this he ought to offer for sins as concerning the people, so also concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'> And no one takes the honor to himself, but he being called by God, even as Aaron also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'> So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become a high priest, but He speaking to Him, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You." Psa. 2:7</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'> As He also says in another, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek," Psa. 110:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'> who in the days of His flesh was offering both petitions and entreaties to Him being able to save Him from death, with strong crying and tears, and being heard from His godly fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'> though being a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'> and being perfected, He became the Author of eternal salvation to all the ones obeying Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'> having been called out by God as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'> Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to interpret since you have become dull in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'> For indeed because of the time you are due to be teachers, yet you need to have someone to teach you again the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become in need of milk, and not of solid food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'> for everyone partaking of milk is without experience in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'> But solid food is for those full grown, having exercised the faculties through habit, for distinction of both good and bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'> Because of this, having left the discourse of the beginning of Christ, let us be borne on to full growth, not laying down again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'> of the baptisms, of doctrine, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of dead ones, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'> And this we will do, if indeed God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'> For it is impossible for those being once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and becoming sharers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'> and tasting the good Word of God, and the works of power of a coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'> then falling away, it is impossible for them again to renew to repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God, and putting Him to open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'> (For the earth drinking in the rain often coming upon it, and producing plants fit for those for whom it is also worked, receives blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'> "but bearing thorns and thistles," it is deemed unfit and near a curse, of which the end is for burning.) Gen. 3:17, 18</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'> But, loved ones, even if we indeed speak so, we have been persuaded better things concerning you, even holding fast salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'> For God is not unjust, to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed to His name, ministering to the saints, and now are ministering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'> But we desire each of you to show the same eagerness, to the full assurance of the hope to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'> that you not become dull, but imitators of those who through faith and longsuffering are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'> For God having made promise to Abraham, since He had no greater to swear by, " He swore by Himself,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'> saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you." Gen. 22:16, 17</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'> And so, being long-suffering, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'> For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath to make things sure is to them the end of all gainsaying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'> In which way, desiring to more fully declare to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, God interposed by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'> that through two unchangeable things, in which it was not possible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, those having fled to lay hold on the hope set before us ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'> which we have as an anchor of the soul, both certain and sure, and entering into the inner side of the veil, Lev. 16:12</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'> where Jesus entered as forerunner for us, having become a High Priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'> For this "Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God," the one meeting Abraham "returning from the slaughter" "of the kings," "and blessing him;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'> to whom also Abraham "divided a tenth from all" (first being interpreted, king of righteousness; and then also king of Salem, which is, king of peace, Gen. 14:17-20</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'> without father, without mother, without genealogy, nor beginning of days, nor having end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest in perpetuity).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'> Now behold how great this one was , to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'> and indeed those of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood have a command to tithe the people according to Law, (that is, from their brothers, though coming forth out of Abraham's loins),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'> but he not counting his genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and has blessed the one having the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'> But without contradiction, the lesser is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'> And here dying men indeed receive tithes, but there it having been witnessed that he lives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'> and as a word to say, through Abraham Levi also, the one receiving tithes, has been tithed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'> For he was yet in his father's loins when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'> Truly, then, if perfection was through the Levitical priestly office (for the people had been given Law under it), why yet need for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'> For the priestly office having been changed, of necessity a change of law also occurs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'> For the One of whom these things are said has partaken of another tribe, from which no one has given devotion at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'> For it is clear that our Lord has risen out of Judah, as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'> And it is still more abundantly clear that if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'> who has not become so according to a law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'> For it is testified, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." Psa. 110:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'> For a voiding of the preceding command comes about because of its weakness and unprofitableness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'> For the Law perfected nothing, but a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'> And by how much it was not apart from the swearing of an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'> for they have become priests without the swearing of an oath, but He with the swearing through Him who says to Him, " The Lord swore, and will not repent, You are  a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek;" Psa. 110:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'> by so much Jesus has become Surety of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'> And they truly are many priests, being hindered from continuing because of death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'> but He has the priesthood not to be passed on, because of His continuing forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'> From this also He is able to save to perfection those who come to God through Him, ever living to intercede on their behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'> For such a High Priest was fitting for us: holy, harmless, undefiled, and separated from sinners, and having become higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'> who has no need, as do the high priests, to offer sacrifices day by day, first for His own sins, then for those of the people. For He did this once for all, offering up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'> For the Law makes men high priests who have infirmity, but the word of the swearing of an oath, after the Law, appoints the Son forever, having been perfected.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'> Now a summary over the things being said: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right of the throne of the Majesty in Heaven, Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'> Minister of the Holy of Holies, and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'> For every high priest is set in place to offer both gifts and sacrifices; from which it is necessary for this One also to have something which He may offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'> For if indeed He were on earth, He would not even be a priest, there being those priests offering gifts according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'> who serve the pattern of and shadow of heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely warned, being about to make the tabernacle: For He says, "See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you in the mount."  Ex. 25:40</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'> But now He has gotten a more excellent ministry, also by so much as He is a Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'> For if that first was faultless, place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'> For finding fault, He said to them, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, and I will make an end on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah; a new covenant shall be ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'> not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day of My taking hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says  the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'> Because this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'> "And they shall no more teach each one his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know Me, from the least of them to their great ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and I will not at all remember their sins and their lawless deeds." LXX-Jer. 38:31-34; MT-Jer. 31:31-34</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'> In the saying, New, He has made the first old. And the thing having been made old and growing aged is near disappearing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'> Truly, then, the first tabernacle also had ordinances of service, and the earthly holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'> For the first tabernacle was prepared, in which was both the lampstand and the table, and the setting out of the loaves, which is called holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'> But behind the second veil is a tabernacle, that called Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'> having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant covered around on all sides with gold, in which was the golden pot having the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'> and above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat (about which now is not time to speak piece by piece).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'> And these having been prepared thus, the priests go into the first tabernacle through all, completing the services.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'> But into the second the high priest goes alone once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and the ignorances of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'> the Holy Spirit signifying by this that the way of the Holies has not yet been made manifest, the first tabernacle still having standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'> which was a parable for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, but as regards conscience, not being able to perfect the one serving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'> but only on foods and drinks, and various washings, and fleshly ordinances, until the time of setting things right has been imposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'> But Christ having appeared as a High Priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'> nor through the blood of goats and of calves, but through His own blood, He entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having procured everlasting redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'> For if the blood of bulls and goats, and ashes of a heifer sprinkling those having been defiled, sanctifies to the purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'> by how much more the blood of Christ (who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God), will purify your conscience from dead works for the serving of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'> And because of this He is Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having occurred for redemption of transgressions under the first covenant, those having been called out might receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'> For where a covenant is , the death of him having covenanted must be offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'> For a covenant is affirmed over those dead, since it never has force when he who has covenanted is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'> From which neither the first covenant was dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'> For when every command had been spoken according to Law by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and he sprinkled both the scroll and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'> saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you." Ex. 24:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'> And he likewise sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the service vessels with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'> And almost all things are cleansed by blood according to the Law; and apart from shedding of blood no remission occurs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'> Then it was needful for the figures of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'> For Christ did not enter into the Holy of Holies made by hands, types of the true things, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'> not that often He should offer Himself even as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year with blood of others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'> since He must often have suffered from the foundation of the world. But now once for all, at the completion of the ages, He has been manifested for putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'> And as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this Judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'> so being once offered "to bear the sins of many," Christ shall appear a second time without sin to those expecting Him for salvation. Isa. 53:12</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'> For the Law had a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of those things. Appearing year by year with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually, they never are able to perfect the ones drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'> Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because those serving did not still have conscience of sins, having once for all been cleansed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'> But in these there is a remembrance of sins year by year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'> for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'> For this reason, coming into the world, He says, "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but You prepared a body for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'> You did not delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices concerning sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'> "Then I said, Lo, I come, in the heading of the Book, it was written concerning Me, to do Your will, O God." LXX-Psa. 39:7 -9; MT-Psa. 40:6 -8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'> Above, saying, "You did not desire nor were pleased with sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and sacrifices concerning sins," (which are offered according to the Law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'> then He said, "Lo, I come to do Your will, O God." He takes away the first in order that He may set up the second;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'> by which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'> And indeed every priest stands day by day ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'> But He, offering but one sacrifice for sins, "sat down" in perpetuity " at the right hand " of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'> from then on expecting "until His enemies are placed as a footstool" of His feet. Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'> For by one offering He has perfected in perpetuity the ones being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'> And the Holy Spirit witnesses to us also. For after having said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'> "This is the covenant which I will covenant to them after those days, says the Lord: Giving My laws on their hearts, and I will write them on their minds;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'> also He adds , "I will not at all still remember their sins" and their lawless deeds. LXX-Jer. 38:33, 34 MT-Jer. 31:33, 34</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'> But where remission of these is , there is no longer offering concerning sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'> Then, brothers, having confidence for the entering of the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'> which He consecrated for us, a new and living way through the veil; that is, His flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'> and having a Great Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'> let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts having been sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body having been washed in pure water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'> let us hold fast the confession of the hope without yielding, for He who has promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'> And let us consider one another, to incitement of love and of good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'> not forsaking the assembling together of ourselves, as is the custom of some, but exhorting, and by so much more as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'> For if we are willfully sinning after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice concerning sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'> but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and "zealous fire being about to consume the adversaries." Isa. 26:11</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>  If anyone did not regard the Law of Moses, that one dies without pities on " the word of two or three witnesses." Deut. 17:6</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'> How much worse punishment do you think will be thought worthy to receive , the one trampling the Son of God, and having counted common the blood of the covenant in which he was sanctified, and having insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'> For we know Him who has said, "Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay," says the Lord. And again, "The Lord will judge His people." Deut. 32:35, 36</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'> But call to mind the former days in which being enlightened you endured much conflict of sufferings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'> indeed being exposed both to reproaches and to afflictions; and having become partners of those so living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'> For also you suffered together in my bonds; and you accepted the seizure of your possessions with joy, knowing yourselves to have a better and abiding possession in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'> Then do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'> For you have need of patience, that having done the will of God you may obtain the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'> For, yet a very little and the One coming will come, "and will not delay." Hab. 2:3</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'> "But the just shall live by faith;" "and if he draws back," "My soul is not pleased in him." Hab. 2:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'> But we are not of those withdrawing to destruction, but of faith, to the preservation of the soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'> Now faith is the substantiation of things having been hoped, the evidence of things not having been seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'> For by this the elders obtained witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'> By faith we understand the ages to have been framed by the word of God, so that the things seen should not come into being out of things that appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'> By faith Abel offered a greater sacrifice to God than Cain, by which he obtained witness to be righteous, God testifying over his gifts; and through it, having died, he yet speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'> By faith "Enoch" was translated so as not to see death, and "was not found, because God translated him." For before his translation, he had obtained witness to have been pleasing to God. Gen. 5:24</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'> But without faith it is impossible to please God . For it is right that the one drawing near to God should believe that He is, and that He becomes a rewarder to the ones seeking Him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'> Being warned by God about the things not yet having been seen, moved with fear, by faith Noah prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; through which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness according to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'> Having been called out by faith, Abraham obeyed to go forth to a place which he was going to receive for an inheritance; and he went out not understanding where he went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'> By faith he resided as a foreigner in a land of promise, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint-heirs of the same promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'> for he looked forward to a city having the foundations of which the builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'> Also by faith Sarah herself received power for conceiving seed even beyond the time of age, and gave birth; since she deemed the One having promised to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'> Because of this came into being from one (and that from one having died), seed even "as the stars of the heaven" in multitude and countless "as sand by the seaside." Gen. 22:17</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'> These all died by way of faith, not having received the promises, but seeing them from afar, and being persuaded, and having embraced and confessed that they are aliens and tenants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'> For those saying such things make clear that they seek a fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'> And truly if they remembered that from which they came out, they had time to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'> But now they stretch forth to a better, that is, a heavenly land . Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, for Him to be called their God; for He prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'> By faith, being tested, Abraham offered up Isaac; and he receiving the promises was offering up the only begotten,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'> as to whom it was said, "In Isaac your Seed shall be called;" Gen. 21:12</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'> reckoning that God was able to raise even from the dead; from where indeed he obtained him in a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'> By faith concerning things to come Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'> By faith dying Jacob blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and "worshiped on the top of his staff." LXX-47:31</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'> Dying Joseph by faith made mention of the Exodus of the sons of Israel, and he gave orders concerning his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'> Being born, Moses was by faith hidden by his parents three months, because they saw the child was fair; and they did not fear the king's decree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'> Having become great, Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'> having chosen rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than for a time to have enjoyment of sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'> having counted the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he kept on as seeing the Invisible One .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'> By faith he made the Passover, and the sprinkling of blood, that the destroyer of the first-born might not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'> By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as through dry land ; by which attempt the Egyptians taking, they were swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, having been circled during seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'> By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those disobeying, having received the spies with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'> And what more may I say? For the times will fail me telling about Gideon, Barak, and also Samson and Jephthah, and also David and Samuel, and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'> who through faith overcame kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'> quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouths of the sword, acquired power from weakness, became strong in war, made armies of foreigners to yield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'> Women received their dead by resurrection; but others were beaten to death, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'> And others received trial of mockings and of floggings; yea, more, of bonds and of prison:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'> they were stoned; they were tried; they were sawn in two; they died by murder of sword; they went about in sheepskins and in goatskins, being in need, being afflicted, being ill-treated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'> of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, and mountains, and caves, and the holes of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'> And having obtained witness through the faith, these all did not obtain the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'> God having foreseen something better concerning us, that they should not be perfected apart from us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'> So therefore we also, having so great cloud of witnesses lying around us, having laid aside every weight and the easily surrounding sin, through patience let us also run the race set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'> looking to the Author and Finisher of our faith, Jesus, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, "and sat down at the right" of the throne of God. Psa. 110:1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'> For consider Him who had endured such gainsaying of sinners against Himself, that you do not grow weary, fainting in your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.4'> You did not yet resist unto blood, wrestling against sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'> And you have forgotten the exhortation which He speaks with you, as with sons, "My sons, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint while being corrected by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.6'> For whom the Lord loves, He disciplines, and whips every son whom He receives." Prov. 3:11, 12</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'> If you endure discipline, God is dealing with you as with sons; for who is the son whom a father does not discipline?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.8'> But if you are without discipline, of which all have become sharers, then you are bastards, and not sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'> Furthermore, indeed we have had fathers of our flesh as correctors, and we respected them . Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'> For they truly disciplined us for a few days according to the thing seeming good to them; but He for our profit, in order for us to partake of His holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'> And all discipline for the present indeed does not seem to be joyous, but grievous; but afterward it gives back peaceable fruit of righteousness to the ones having been exercised by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.12'> Because of this, "straighten the hands" hanging alongside, "and the enfeebled knees;"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.20'> for they could not bear the thing enjoined: "Even" "if a beast" "touches the mountain, it will be stoned, or shot through" with a dart. Ex. 19:12, 13</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.3'> Be mindful of the prisoners, as having been bound with them ; of those ill-treated, as also being in the body yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.4'> Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but God will judge fornicators and adulterers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.5'>  Set your way of life without money-loving, being satisfied with present things; for He has said, "Not at all will I leave you, not at all will I forsake you," never! Deut. 31:6</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.9'> Do not be carried away by various and strange doctrine; for it is good that the heart be confirmed by grace, not by foods, in which those walking in them were not profited.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.11'> For of the animals whose "blood is brought" by the high priest "into the Holy of Holies" concerning sins, of these the bodies "are burned outside the camp." Lev. 16:27</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.13'> So let us go forth to Him outside the camp bearing His reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.14'> For we do not have here a continuing city, but we seek the city coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'> Then through Him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God always, that is, the fruit of the lips, confessing to His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'> But do not be forgetful of doing good and sharing, for God is well pleased with such sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'> Yield to those taking the lead of you, and submit, for they watch for your souls, giving an account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning; for this would be no profit to you.</verse>
