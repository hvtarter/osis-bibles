      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'> And when the seventh month had come, and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people assembled as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'> Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel in order to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'> From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Jehovah. But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'> They also gave silver to the cutters and to the craftsmen; and food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'> Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests, and the Levites, and all they who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began. And they made to stand the Levites from a son of twenty years and over, to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'> Then Jeshua stood up together with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, to oversee the workmen in the house of God, the sons of Henadad with their sons, and their brothers the Levites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'> But many of the priests and Levites, and heads of the fathers, the aged men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. And many shouted aloud for joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'> So that the people could not tell the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of weeping of the people. For the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'> And when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the exile built the temple to Jehovah the God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'> then they came to Zerubbabel and to the head of the fathers and said to them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as you. And we have not sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'> But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel said to them, It is not for you and for us to build a house to our God. But we ourselves will together build to Jehovah the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'> Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and terrified them in building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'> And they hired counselors against them to break their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'> And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'> And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, wrote to Artaxerxes the king of Persia. And the letter was written in Aramaic, and translated from Aramaic:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'> Rehum, the master of counsel in charge, and Shimshai the scribe, wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'> Then Rehum the master of counsel, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges and the emissaries, the consuls, the officials, the Erechites, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, (that is, the Elamites),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'> and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar exiled and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest of the province Beyond the River, and now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'> this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him, to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, and now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'> let it be known to e king that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding the rebellious and the evil city and are completing its walls, and have joined the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'> Now let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt, and the walls completed, they will not give tax, tribute, and forced labor, and it will cause the king's revenue to suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'> Now because we have partaken of the palace salt, and it is not right for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and notified the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'> so that he may search in the book of the records of your fathers, and you shall discover in the book of the records and shall know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and to provinces; and insurrection was stirred up in it in the past; for which reason this city was destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'> We notify the king that if that city is built, and its walls completed, then you shall have no portion Beyond the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'> The message the king sent to Rehum the master of counsel, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their associates who dwell in Samaria, and to the rest Beyond the River: Peace! And now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'> the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'> And I gave a decree, and search has been made, and it is found that this city has lifted up itself against kings in the past, and rebellion and revolt have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'> There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all Beyond the River. And tax, tribute, and forced labor were paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'> Now make a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be rebuilt until the decree shall be given from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'> And beware of being at fault, to act on this. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'> Then as soon as the copy of the letter of Artaxerxes the king was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they hurried to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them stop working by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'> Then the work of the house of God in Jerusalem stopped. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'> And the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God in Jerusalem. And with them were the prophets of God helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'> At that time Tatnai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-boznai, and their associates, came to them, and said this to them: Who has commanded you to build this house and to complete this structure?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'> Then we spoke to them in this way, What are they, the names of the men building this building?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'> But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they could not cause them to stop until the matter came to Darius. And then they sent back a letter concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'> The copy of the letter which Tatnai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-boznai, and his associates the officials who were Beyond the River, sent to Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'> They sent a letter to him, and this was written in it: To Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'> Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, and it is being built with rolling stones, and timber is being laid in the walls, and that work is being done perfectly, and is prospering in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'> Then we asked those elders, saying said this to them, Who commanded you to rebuild this house, and to complete this structure?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'> And we also asked their names in order to inform you so that we might write the names of the men who are at their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'> And they returned the answer to us this way, saying, We are servants of the God of Heaven and earth. And we are rebuilding the house that was built many years before this, and the great king of Israel built it and finished it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'> But because our fathers had provoked to wrath the God of Heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he tore down this house, and he exiled its people to Babylon.</verse>
