        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'> Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths, all the days of the desolation. And you shall be in the land of your enemies; then the land shall enjoy rest, and shall enjoy its sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'> It shall rest all the days of the desolation, that which it has not rested in your sabbaths while you lived on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'> And those who are left of you, I shall also bring a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they shall fall when no one pursues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.37'> And they shall stumble upon one another, as if it were before the sword, when no one pursues. And you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.38'> And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.39'> And of those who are left of you, they shall putrefy in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, they shall putrefy with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.40'> And if they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass with which they have trespassed against Me; and, also, that they have walked contrary to Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'> I also will walk contrary to them, and I will bring them into the land of their enemies. If their uncircumcised hearts are then humbled, and they then have satisfied for their iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'> then I will remember My covenant with Jacob; and also My covenant with Isaac; and I shall also remember My covenant with Abraham, and I shall remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'> For the land shall be forsaken by them, and shall satisfy for its sabbaths, in the desolation without them. And they shall satisfy for their iniquity, because, even because, they have kicked against My judgments, and their soul has loathed My statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'> And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I hate them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'> Then I shall remember for them the covenant of the first fathers, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God; I am Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'> These are the statutes and the judgments and the laws which Jehovah has given between Him and the sons of Israel, in Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'> Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, When a man makes a difficult vow by your evaluation, the persons shall be Jehovah's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'> And your evaluation shall be of the male from a son of twenty years even until a son of sixty years; then your evaluation shall be fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.4'> And if it is a female, then your evaluation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.5'> And if from a son of five years to a son of twenty years, then your evaluation shall be twenty shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.6'> And if a son of a month even to a son of five years, then your evaluation shall be five shekels of silver for the male and three shekels of silver for the female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'> And if from a son of sixty years and above, if a male, then your evaluation shall be fifteen shekels and for a female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'> but if he is too poor for your evaluation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to the reach of him who vowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'> And if it is an animal of which they bring an offering to Jehovah, all that one gives of it to Jehovah is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'> He shall not replace it, or change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'> And if any unclean animal, or one which they may not bring as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall make stand the animal before the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'> And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you the priest value it, so it shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'> But if he really redeems it, then he shall add its fifth to your evaluation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'> And when a man sanctifies his house as a holy thing to Jehovah, then the priest shall value it, whether good or bad. As the priest values it, so it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'> And if he who is sanctifying shall redeem the house, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of its valuation, and it shall become his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'> And if a man sanctifies a field of his property to Jehovah, then your valuation shall be according to its seed; a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'> If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand according to your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'> And if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall count to him the silver according to the years which are left, to the year of the jubilee. And it shall be deducted from your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'> And if he sanctifying the field really will redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of your evaluation to it, and it shall rise to become his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'> And if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it is not to be redeemed any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'> And the field shall be holy to Jehovah when it goes out in the jubilee, as a field which is devoted. It shall be a possession to the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'> And if he should devote a field of his purchase, which is not of the fields of his possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'> then the priest shall count to him the amount of your valuation to the year of jubilee. And he shall give your valuation in that day, a holy thing to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'> In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom he bought it, to him who owns it in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'> And all your valuation shall be by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'> However, no man shall dedicate a firstling, which is first-born to Jehovah among animals, whether ox or sheep; it is Jehovah's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'> And if among the unclean animals, then he shall ransom it at your valuation, and he shall add its fifth to it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold at your evaluation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'> But any devoted thing which a man devotes to Jehovah from all which belongs to him, of man or of animal, or of the field of his possession, it shall not be sold nor redeemed. Every devoted thing to Jehovah is most holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'> No devoted thing which is dedicated by man shall be ransomed; it shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'> And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, shall be Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'> And if a man really redeems any of his tithes, he shall add its fifth to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'> And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock, all that passes under the rod, a tenth shall be holy to Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'> he shall not search whether it is good or bad, nor shall he change it. And if he at all changes it, then it shall be that it and its substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'> These are the commands which Jehovah has commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, on Mount Sinai.</verse>
