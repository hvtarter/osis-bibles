  <div type='book' osisID='2Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'> Brothers, we are bound to give thanks to God always concerning you, even as it is right, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each one of you multiplies toward one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'> so as for us to boast ourselves in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions, and the afflictions which you endure,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'> a clear token of the just judgment of God, for you to be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you indeed suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'> since it is a just thing with God to pay back tribulation to the ones troubling you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'> and to give you, those being troubled, relief with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from Heaven with angels of His power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'> in flaming fire giving full vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, Isa. 66:15; Jer. 10:25</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'> who will pay the penalty: everlasting destruction from the face of the Lord, "and from the glory of His strength," Isa. 2:20</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'> when He comes to be glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all those who believe in that Day, because our testimony to you was believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'> For which we also continually pray concerning you, that our God would count you worthy of the calling, and would fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness, and work of faith in power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'> so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'> And, brothers, we entreat you, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'> for you not to be quickly shaken in the mind, nor to be disturbed, neither through a spirit, nor through speech, nor through letter, as through us, as if the Day of Christ has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'> Do not let anyone deceive you in any way, because that Day will not come unless first comes the falling away, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'> the one opposing and exalting himself over everything being called God, or object of worship, so as for him "to sit in the temple of God" as God, proclaiming that he himself is God. Dan. 11:36; Eze. 28:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'> Do you not remember that I told you these things, I yet being with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'> And now you know the thing holding back, for him to be revealed in his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'> For the mystery of lawlessness already is working, only he is holding back now, until it comes out of the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'> And then "the Lawless One" will be revealed, "whom" "the Lord" "will consume" "by the spirit of His mouth," and He will bring to nought by the brightness of His presence. Isa. 11:4</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>  His coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and miracles and lying wonders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'> and in all deceit of unrighteousness in those being lost, because they did not receive the love of the truth in order for them to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'> And because of this, God will send to them a working of error, for them to believe the lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'> that all may be judged, those not believing the truth, but who have delighted in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'> But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'> to which He called you through our gospel, to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'> So, then, brothers, stand firm and strongly hold the teachings you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'> But may our Lord Himself, Jesus Christ, and our God and Father, He who loves and gives us everlasting encouragement and good hope by grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'> encourage your hearts, and may He establish you in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'> For the rest, brothers, pray concerning us, that the Word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it has with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'> and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil men. For faith is not in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'> But the Lord is faithful who will establish and will guard you from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'> But we are persuaded in the Lord as to you, that whatever things we have commanded you, you both do and you will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'> And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'> And we charge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to draw yourselves back from every brother walking in a disorderly way, and not according to the teaching which you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'> For you yourselves know how it is right to act like us, because we were not disorderly among you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'> nor did we eat bread from anyone as a gift, but by labor and toil, working night and day in order not to burden anyone of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'> Not that we do not have authority, but that we give ourselves as an example to you, for you to act like us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'> For even when we were with you, we commanded this to you: If anyone does not desire to work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'> For we hear some are walking in a disorderly way among you, not working at all, but being busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'> And we command such and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that working with quietness, they may eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'> And you, brothers, do not lose heart in well doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'> But if anyone does not obey our word through the letter, mark that one, and do not associate with him, that he be shamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'> But do not count him an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'> And may the Lord of peace Himself continually give peace to you in every way. The Lord be with all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'> The greeting of Paul by my hand is the sign in every letter; so I write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
