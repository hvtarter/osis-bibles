      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'> A Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to show to His slaves things which must occur quickly. And He signified by sending through His angel to His slave, John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'> who testified of the Word of God and the witness of Jesus Christ, even as many things as he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'> Blessed is the one reading, and those hearing the words of this prophecy, and keeping the things having been written; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'> John to the seven churches in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven spirits which are before His throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'> even from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the First-born out of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him loving us and washing us from our sins by His blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'> and made us kings and priests to God, even His Father. To Him is the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'> "Behold, He comes with the clouds," and "every eye will see Him, and the ones who pierced" Him, and all the tribes of the earth "will wail on account of Him." Yes, Amen. Dan. 7:13; Zech. 12:10</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, the One who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'> I, even your brother John, and co-sharer in the affliction, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, came to be in the island being called Patmos because of the Word of God, and because of the witness of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'> I came to be in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'> saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; also, What you see, write in a scroll, and send to the seven churches of Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'> And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'> And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of man, having been clothed to the feet, and having been girded with a golden girdle at the breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'> And the hairs of His head were white as white wool, as snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'> and His feet like burnished brass having been fired in a furnace; and His voice as a sound of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'> and having in His right hand seven stars; and a sharp, two-edged sword proceeding out of His mouth, and His face shining as the sun in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'> And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet, as dead. And He put His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not fear. I am the First and the Last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'> and the Living One; and I became dead; and, behold, I am living forever and ever. Amen. And I have the keys to Hades, and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'> Write what things you saw, and what things are, and what things are about to occur after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'> The mystery of the seven stars which you saw on My right, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands you saw are seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'> To the angel of the Ephesian church, write: These things says the One holding the seven stars in His right hand , He walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'> I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and that you cannot bear evil ones; and you tried those pretending to be apostles and are not, and found them to be liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'> And I know you bore up and have patience and on account of My name you have labored and have not wearied,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'> But I have against you that you left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'> Then remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the first works. And if not, I am coming to you quickly, and will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'> But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one overcoming, I will give to him to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'> And to the angel of the church of Smyrna, write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lived:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'> I know your works, and the affliction, and the poverty; but you are rich. And I know the evil speaking of those saying themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'> Do not at all fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil is about to throw you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one overcoming will not at all be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write: These things says the One having the sharp, two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'> I know your works, and where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is . And you hold My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness; who was killed alongside you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'> But I have a few things against you, that you have there those holding the teachings of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'> So you also have those holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'> Repent! But if not, I will come to you quickly, and I will make war with them by the sword of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one overcoming, I will give him to eat from the hidden manna. And I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name having been written, which no one knows except the one receiving it .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'> And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: These things says the Son of God, the One having His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like burnished brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'> I know your works, and the love, and the ministry, and the faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'> But I have a few things against you, that you allow the woman Jezebel to teach, she saying herself to be a prophetess, and to cause My slaves to go astray, and to commit fornication, and to eat idol sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'> And I gave time to her that she might repent of her fornication. And she did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'> Behold, I am throwing her into a bed, and into great affliction those committing adultery with her, unless they repent of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches will know that I am the One searching the inner parts and hearts. And I will give to each of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'> But I say to you and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, and who did not know the deep things of Satan, as they say: I am not casting another burden on you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'> but what you have, hold until I shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'> And the one overcoming, and the one keeping My works until the end, "I will give to him authority over the nations,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'> and "he will shepherd them with an iron staff" (they are "broken to pieces like clay vessels"), as I also have received from My Father. Psa. 2:8, 9</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'> And I will give to him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'> And to the angel of the church in Sardis, write: These things says the One having the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have the name that you live, and are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'> Be watching, and establish the things left, which are about to die. For I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'> Then remember how you received and heard, and keep, and repent. If, then, you do not watch, I will come upon you like a thief and you will not at all know what hour I come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'> You also have a few names in Sardis which did not defile their robes, and they shall walk with Me in white because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'> The one overcoming, this one shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not at all blot his name out of the Book of Life; and I will acknowledge his name before My Father, and before His angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia, write: These things says the Holy One, the True One, the One having "the key of David," "the One opening, and no one shuts; and shuts, and no one opens:" Isa. 22:22</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'> I know your works. Behold, I have given a door being opened before you, and no one is able to shut it, for you have a little power and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'> Behold, I give out of the synagogue of Satan those saying themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but they lie. Behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they shall know that I loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'> Because you kept the word of My patience, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is going to come on all the habitable world in order to try those dwelling on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'> Behold, I am coming quickly. Hold what you have that no one take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'> The one overcoming, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall not go out any more. And I will write the name of My God on him, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem which comes down out of Heaven from My God, and My new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'> And to the angel of the church of Laodicea, write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Head of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'> I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold, or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'> So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'> Because you say, I am rich, and I am made rich, and I have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'> I advise you to buy from Me gold having been fired by fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, and your shame and nakedness may not be revealed. And anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'> I, as many "as I love, I rebuke and I chasten." Be zealous, then, and repent. Prov. 3:12</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'> Behold, I stand at the door and knock: If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will enter to him, and I will dine with him, and he with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'> The one overcoming, I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father in His throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'> The one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'> After these things I saw. And behold, a door being opened in Heaven! And I heard the first voice as a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you what needs to happen after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'> And at once I became in spirit. And, behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and One sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'> And the One sitting was in appearance like a jasper stone, and a sardius; and a rainbow was around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'> And around the throne I saw twenty four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty four elders sitting, having been clothed in white garments. And they had golden crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'> And out of the throne come forth lightnings and thunders and voices. And seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'> and a glassy sea before the throne, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'> And the first living creature was like a lion; and the second living creature like a calf; and the third living creature having a face like a man; and the fourth living creature like an eagle flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'> And the four living creatures each one had six wings around, and within being full of eyes. And they had no rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," the One who  was, and is, and is coming!  Isa. 6:3</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'> And when ever the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to the One sitting on the throne, to the One living forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'> the twenty four elders fall down before Him sitting on the throne; and they will worship the One living forever and ever, and will throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'> Lord, You are worthy to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because You created all things, and through Your will they exist and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'> And I saw on the right of the One sitting on the throne a scroll having been written within and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice: Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loosen its seals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'> And no one in Heaven was able to open the scroll nor to see it, neither on the earth, nor underneath the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'> And I wept much, because no one worthy was found to open and to read the scroll, nor to see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'> And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep, Behold, the Lion being of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, overcame so as to open the scroll, and to loose its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'> And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, was a Lamb standing, as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, having been sent out into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'> And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'> And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having harps, and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'> And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy are You to receive the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and by Your blood purchased us to God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'> and made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'> And I saw, and I heard a sound of many angels around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders, and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'> saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb having been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'> And every creature which is in Heaven, and in the earth, and underneath the earth, and the things that are on the sea, and the things in all of them, I heard saying: To Him sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'> And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty four elders fell down and worshiped the One living forever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'> And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals. And I heard one of the four living creatures, like a sound of thunder, saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'> And I saw, and behold, a white horse! And the one sitting on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went out overcoming, and that he might overcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'> And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'> And another horse went out, red. And it was given to the one sitting on it to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another. And a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'> And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and the one sitting on it having a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'> And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'> And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'> And I saw, and behold, a pale green horse, and the name of the one sitting on it was Death; and Hades followed after him. And authority was given to them to kill over the fourth of the earth with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'> And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those having been slain for the word of God, and for the witness which they had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'> And they cried with a great voice, saying, Until when, holy and true Master, do You not judge and take vengeance for our blood, from those dwelling on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'> And there was given to each one a white robe. And it was said to them that they should rest yet a little time, until might be fulfilled also the number of their fellow-slaves and their brothers, those being about to be killed, even as they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'> And I saw when He opened the sixth seal. And behold, a great earthquake occurred. And the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair; and the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'> and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree being shaken by a great wind casts its unripe figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'> And the heaven departed like a scroll being rolled up. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'> And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the rich ones, and the commanders, and the powerful ones, and every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'> And "they said to the mountains" and to the rocks, "Fall on us," and hide us from the face of the One sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, Hos. 10:8</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'> because the great day of His wrath has come; and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'> And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on every tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'> And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God. And he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to them to harm the earth and the sea, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'> And the nations of the ones saved will walk in its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'> And its gates may not at all be shut by day, for no night will be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'> And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'> And all profaning may not at all enter into it, or any making an abomination or a lie; but only the ones having been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'> And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, coming forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'> In the midst of its street and of the river, from here and from there, was a tree of life producing twelve fruits: according to one month each yielding its fruit. And the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'> And every curse will no longer be. And the throne of God and the Lamb will be in it; and His slaves will serve Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'> And they will see His face; and His name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'> And night will not be there; and they have no need of a lamp or a light of the sun, because the Lord God will shed light on them. And they shall reign forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'> And he said to me, These words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His slaves what must happen quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'> Behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is the one keeping the words of the prophecy of this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'> And I, John, was the one seeing and hearing these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing me these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'> And he said to me, Behold! Stop! For I am your fellow-slave, and of your brothers the prophets, and of the ones keeping the words of this Book. Do worship to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'> And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this Book, because the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'> The one acting unjustly, let him still act unjustly; and the filthy, let him still be filthy; and the righteous, let him still do righteousness; and the holy, let him still be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'> And, behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to each as his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'> Blessed are the ones doing His commands, that their authority will be over the Tree of Life, and by the gates they may enter into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'> But outside are the dogs and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone loving a lie, and making it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'> I, Jesus, sent My angel to testify these things to you over the churches. I am the Root and Offspring of David, the bright and morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And the one hearing, let him say, Come! And the one thirsting, let him come; and the one desiring, let him take of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'> For I testify together with everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add upon him the plagues having been written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'> And if anyone takes away from the words of the Book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the Book of Life, and out of the holy city, and of the things having been written in this Book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'> The One testifying these things says, Yes, I am coming quickly. Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.</verse>
