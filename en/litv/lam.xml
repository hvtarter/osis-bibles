      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'> How alone sits the city that was full of people! She has become like a widow, great among the nations; A noblewoman among the provinces has become a payer of tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'> She bitterly weeps in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks. She has no comforter among all her lovers. All her friends dealt deceit with her; they became enemies to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'> Judah went captive from affliction, and from great slavery. She dwells among the nations; She finds no rest. All her pursuers have overtaken her between the straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'> The roads of Zion are in mourning without any going to the appointed feasts . All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted; and she is in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'> Her foes have become as chief; her haters are at ease. For Jehovah has afflicted her for the multitude of her trespasses. Her children have gone, captive before the foe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'> And from the daughter of Zion all her splendor has departed. Her rulers have become like bucks; they find no pasture; and they have gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>  In the days of her affliction and her wandering, Jerusalem remembers all her desirable things from previous days, when her people fell into the hand of the foe; and there is no ally for her. The foes saw her; they laughed at her annihilations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'> Jerusalem has grievously sinned; on account of this, she has been removed. All the ones knowing her despise her, for they saw her nakedness. Also, she groans and turns backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'> Her uncleanness is in her skirts. She did not remember her end and has gone down astoundingly. She had no comforter. O Jehovah, behold my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'> The enemy has spread out his hand on all her desirable things. Indeed, she has seen the nations enter into her holy place, whom You commanded that they not enter into Your congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'> All her people sigh from seeking bread. They gave their desirable things for food to revive the soul. See, O Jehovah, and look on me , for I have become vile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>  Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which is done to me, with which Jehovah has afflicted me in the day of His burning anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'> From on high He has sent fire into my bones, and subdued it. He spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He gave me desolation. All the days I faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand, they intertwine, they rise on my neck. He caused my strength to falter. The Lord gave me into their hands. I am not able to rise up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'> The Lord has trampled all my mighty ones in my midst. He called a gathering against me to crush my young men. As a winepress, the Lord trod the virgin daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'> I weep for these; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because far from me is a comforter reviving my soul. My sons are desolated because the enemy prevails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'> Zion spreads forth her hands; there is not one comforting to her; Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob that his enemies should be all around him. Jerusalem has become as an impure thing among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'> Jehovah is righteous, for I rebelled against His mouth. I beseech you, all peoples, hear and see my sorrow. My virgins and my young men went into exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'> I called for my lovers; they deceived me. My priests and my elders expired in the city, while they sought food for them to bring back their life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'> Behold, O Jehovah, for I am distressed. My inward parts ferment; my heart is overturned within me; for I have grievously rebelled. On the outside the sword bereaves; in the house it is as death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'> They hear that I sigh; there is no comforter to me. All my enemies have heard my evil; they rejoice that You have done it . You will bring the day that You have called, and they shall be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'> Let all their evil come before You; and do to them as You have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'> How the Lord has clouded over the daughter of Zion in His anger! He cast the beauty of Israel down from the heavens to the earth, and did not remember His footstool in the day of His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'> The Lord swallowed up all of Jacob's dwelling-places, and did not pity. In His wrath He has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He made them touch to the earth. He has defiled the kingdom and its rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'> He cut off all the horn of Israel in hot anger. He has turned back His right hand from the face of the haters, and He burned in Jacob as a flaming fire; it consumes all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'> He trod His bow like an enemy, and set His right hand like a foe; and killed all who were desirable to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion. He poured out His fury like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'> The Lord was like an enemy; He swallowed up Israel; He swallowed up all his palaces and destroyed his strongholds; and He increased mourning and weeping in the daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'> And He violated his booth like a garden and destroyed his meeting-places. Jehovah made meeting-places and sabbaths forgotten in Zion, and He rejected king and priest in the fury of His anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'> The Lord has cast off His altar; He rejected His holy place. He has delivered the walls of her palaces into the hater's hand. They gave a noise in Jehovah's house, as a day of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'> Jehovah willed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out a line. He has not withdrawn His hand from swallowing; and He made rampart and wall lament; they languish together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'> Her gates have sunk in the ground; He has dispersed and shattered her bars. Her kings and her rulers are among the nations. The law is not. Also her prophets have not found a vision from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'> They sit on the ground; the elders of Zion's daughters are silent. They send up dust on their heads, they gird on sack cloths. The virgins of Jerusalem let their heads hang to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'> And my eyes are at an end with tears, my inward parts ferment; my liver is poured on the ground for the ruin of the daughter of my people; in the fainting of children and sucklings in the city's plazas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'> They say to their mothers, Where are grain and wine? In their fainting, they are like the wounded in the plazas of the city, in their pouring out their lives to their mothers' bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'> What can I testify for you? To what will I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I equate you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your crushing is great like the sea! Who can heal you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'> Your prophets have seen false and foolish things for you; and they have not revealed your iniquity, to turn back your captivity. Yea, they visioned for you burdens of falsehood and seductions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'> All who pass by clap their hands at you. They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city which they called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'> All your haters have opened their mouth against you; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed up. Surely this is the day for which we waited; we have found; we have seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'> Jehovah has done what He purposed; He fulfilled His word which He commanded from days of antiquity. He has dashed and not pitied. And He made the hater to rejoice over you; He raised the horn of your foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'> Their heart cried to the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears go out like a torrent by day and by night; do not give relief to yourself; let not the daughter of your eye rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'> Rise up, cry out in the night at the head of the watches; pour out your heart like waters before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands to Him for the life of your children faint with hunger at the head of every open place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'> Behold, O Jehovah, and look! To whom have you done this? Should women eat their fruit, children of tender care? Should priest and prophet be killed in the holy place of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'> Young and old lie on the ground of the plazas. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed in the day of Your anger. You have killed, You have not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'> You have called my terrors all around, as in a day of appointment; and there was not an escaped one or a survivor in the day of the anger of Jehovah. Those whom I have nursed and multiplied, my enemy has consumed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'> I, the man, have seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'> He led me and made me go in darkness and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'> Surely He turned against me; He turns His hand all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'> He has wasted my flesh and my skin. He has shattered my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'> He built against me and has put around me bitterness and hardship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'> He has made me live in dark places like the dead of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'> He walled around me and I cannot go out; He has made heavy my bronze chain .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'> Also, when I cry out and shout for help, He shuts out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'> He walled up my ways with cut stone; my paths are crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'> He was a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'> He has deflected my ways and torn me to pieces; He made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'> He has trod His bow and set me up as a mark for the arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'> He caused the sons of His quiver to enter into my inward parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'> I was a mockery to all my people, their song all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'> He has filled me with bitterness and made me drunk with wormwood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.16'> And He broke my teeth with gravel; He has covered me in the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'> And You cast off my soul from peace; I have forgotten goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'> And I said, My strength and my hope are gone from Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'> Remember my affliction and my roaming, as wormwood and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'> My soul vividly remembers and bows down on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'> I bring back this to my heart. On account of this I hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>  It is by the kindnesses of Jehovah that we are not consumed, for His mercies are not ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.23'>  They are new by mornings; great is Your faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.24'> Jehovah is my portion, says my soul. On account of this I shall hope to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.25'> Jehovah is good to those waiting on Him, to the soul seeking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.26'>  It is good that a man hopes for the salvation of Jehovah, even in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.27'>  It is good for a man that he bear a yoke in his youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.28'> He sits alone and is silent, for He laid it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.29'> He puts his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there is hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.30'> He gives his cheek to Him who strikes him; he is filled with reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.31'> For the Lord will not cast off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.32'> For though He causes grief, He will have pity according to His many kindnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.33'> For He does not afflict from His heart, nor does He grieve the sons of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.34'> to crush all the prisoners of earth under His feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.35'> to turn aside the justice of a man before the face of the Most High,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.36'> to wrong a man in his cause. This, the Lord does not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.37'> Who is this speaking, and it happens when the Lord does not command it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.38'>  Both the evil and the good do not go out from the mouth of the Most High.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.39'> What? Should mankind complain, living man because of his sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.40'> Let us search and examine our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.41'> Let us lift up our heart and palms to God in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.42'> We have transgressed and rebelled; You, You have not forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.43'> You have wrapped Yourself with anger and pursued us; You have slain; You have not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.44'> You have covered with a cloud for You, from any prayer passing through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.45'> You have made us sweepings and garbage in the midst of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.46'> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.47'> Dread and a pit is ours, devastation and ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.48'> Streams of water go out of my eye for the ruin of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.49'> My eye flows out and does not cease, from there not being any relaxing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.50'> until Jehovah shall look down and see from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.51'> My eye deals severely with my soul, from all the daughters of my city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.52'> My haters have hunted me like a bird without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.53'> They have cut off my life in the pit, and they threw a stone at me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.54'> Waters flowed over on my head; I said, I am cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.55'> I called on Your name, O Jehovah, from the lowest pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.56'> You have heard my voice; do not hide Your ear at my relief, at my cry for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.57'> You came near in the day I called You; you said, Do not fear!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.58'> O Lord, You contended for the causes of my soul; You redeemed my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.59'> You have seen my wrong, O Jehovah; judge my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.60'> You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.61'> You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their plots against me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.62'> the lips of those rising up against me, and their scheming against me all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.63'> Look at their sitting and their rising up. I am their song.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.64'> You will give back a recompense to them, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.65'> You will give them an insolent heart as Your curse to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.66'> Pursue and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of Jehovah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lam.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.1'> How the gold dims, the good gold is changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.2'> The precious sons of Zion are weighed against pure gold. How they are counted as earthen vessels, the work of a potter's hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.3'> Even the jackals draw out the breast; they suckle their young. But the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.4'> The tongue of the nursling cleaves to his palate in thirst. The young children ask bread, but there is no breaking for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.5'> Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets; those reared on scarlet embrace dunghills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.6'> And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is heaped more than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were spun on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.7'> Her Nazarites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; they were redder of bone than corals; their cuttings as azure-blue , as lapis lazuli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.8'> Their appearance is darker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it is dried up, it has become like wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.9'> Better are the ones slain by the sword than the ones slain by hunger, those who flow away, pierced because the produce of my fields failed .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.10'> The hands of the compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became food to them in the ruin of the daughter of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.11'> Jehovah has fulfilled His fury; He has poured out His fierce anger and has kindled a fire in Zion; and it has devoured its foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.12'> The kings of the earth and all the world's inhabitants would not have believed that the foe and the hater would go into the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.13'> Because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, shedding the blood of the righteous in her midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.14'> they reeled blind in the streets. They are defiled with blood, so that not any are able to touch their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.15'> They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart! Touch not! Indeed they fled and reeled. They said among the nations, They will not continue to live there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.16'> The face of Jehovah has shared them out; He will not continue to look on them. They did not lift up the face of the priests, they did not favor the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.17'> While we are, our eyes fail for our vain help. In our watching, we have watched for a nation; it does not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.18'> They hunted our steps from going in our open places. Our end came near, our days were fulfilled, for our end had come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.19'> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they hotly pursued us on the mountains; they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.20'> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was captured in their pits; of whom we said, In his shadow we will live among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.21'> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, living in the land of Uz, The cup also shall pass through to you; you shall be drunken and stripped naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.4.22'> Your perversity is complete, daughter of Zion; He will not continue to exile you. He will visit your perversity, daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.1'> O Jehovah, remember what has been to us; look upon and see our shame.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.12'> Rulers were hanged by their hands; the faces of the elders were not honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.13'> They lifted the young men to the hand mill, and the youths stumbled at the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.5.14'> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.5.22'> unless You have utterly rejected us; You are exceedingly angry against us.</verse>
