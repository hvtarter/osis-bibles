      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'> Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to the beloved and our fellow-worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'> and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'> I thank my God always making mention of you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'> hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'> so that the fellowship of your faith may operate in a full knowledge of every good thing in you for Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'> For we have much joy and encouragement over your love, in that the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'> Because of this, having much boldness in Christ to enjoin you to do what is becoming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'> rather because of love I entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'> I entreat you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I fathered in my bonds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'> the one once worthless to you, but now useful to you and to me; whom I sent back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'> Even receive him, that is, my heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'> Whom I resolved to hold with myself, that for you he minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your good might not be by way of necessity, but by way of willingness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'> For perhaps for this he was separated for an hour, that you might receive him eternally;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'> no longer as a slave, but beyond a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'> Then if you have me as a partner, receive him as me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'> And if he wronged you in anything, or owes, reckon this to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'> I, Paul, wrote with my hand; I will repay (that I not say to you that you even owe yourself to me also).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'> Yes, brother, that I may have your help in the Lord, refresh my heart in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'> Trusting to your obedience, I wrote to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'> But at once prepare lodging for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'> Epaphras, my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus, greets you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>  also my fellow-workers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
