      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'> And it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah spoke to the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'> My servant Moses is dead. And now rise up, cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'> Every place on which the sole of your foot shall tread, I have given it to you, as I spoke to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'> From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'> No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor will I forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'> Be strong and brave. For you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'> Only be strong and very brave, so that you may take heed to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may act wisely wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'> This hook of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, and you shall meditate on it by day and by night, so that you shall be on guard to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall prosper your way, and then you shall act wisely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and brave. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for Jehovah your God is with you in all places where you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'> Then commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'> Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare food for you. For within three days you are crossing this Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'> And spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'> Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest, and He has given to you this land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'> your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given to you beyond the Jordan. But you shall cross over armed before your brothers, all the mighty warriors, and shall help them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'> until Jehovah has given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and they, even they have possessed the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them Then you may return to the land of your possession, and may possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to you beyond the Jordan toward the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'> And they answered Joshua, saying, We will do all that you command us; and we will go everywhere you shall send us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'> According to all we heard from Moses, so we will listen to you. Surely Jehovah your God is with you, as He has been with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'> Whoever rebels against your mouth, and will not listen to +your commands in all that you say to him, he shall be put to death. Only, be strong and brave.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'> And the son of Nun sent two men out of Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go look over the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a woman, a harlot; and her name was Rahab. And they lay down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'> And it was reported to the King of Jericho saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the sons of Israel, to search the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'> And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come in to you, who have come into your house. For they have come in to search out all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'> And the woman took the two men and hid them, and said, This way the men came in to me, but I did not know from where they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'> And it happened as the gate was to be shut at dark, even the men went out. I do not know where they have gone. You go after them, and hurry, for you may overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'> But she made them go up on the roof, and hid them with stalks of flax, which she arranged on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'> And the men went after them the way of the Jordan, by the fords. And they shut the gate afterwards, when the pursuers had gone after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'> And before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'> And she said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given the land to you, and that your terror has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'> For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds before you, as you were going out of Egypt; also that which you have done to two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan; to Sihon, and to Og, whom you destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'> And we have heard, and our heart has melted, and there not still rises spirit in any man, because of you. For Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above, and in the earth below.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'> And now, please swear by me by Jehovah, since I have dealt with you in kindness, that you will also deal with my father's house in kindness, and shall give to me a true token;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'> and shall keep alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they own and shall deliver our souls from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'> And the men said to her, Our life is yours. If you do not tell this business of ours, then it shall be, when Jehovah gives this land to us that we shall deal with you in kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'> Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was in the side of the wall, and she lived in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'> And she said to them, Go to the mountain lest the pursuers come upon you. And you shall hide there three days until the pursuers return; and afterward you shall go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'> And the men said to her, We will be guiltless from this oath of yours which you made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'> Behold, we are coming into the land; you shall bind this scarlet thread of line in the window by which you have let us down. And you shall gather your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's house to you, to the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'> And it shall be, anyone who goes outside from the doors of your house his blood shall be on his head, and we shall be innocent. And anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'> But if you reveal this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless from your oath which you make us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'> And she said, Let it be according to your words. And she sent them away. And they went. And she bound the line of scarlet thread in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'> And they departed and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. And the pursuers searched in all the way, but did not find them .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'> And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and crossed over, and came to the son of Nun, and reported to him all that had happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'> And they said to Joshua, Surely Jehovah has given all the land into our hands. And also, all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'> And rose up early in the morning. And they moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel. And they stayed there before they crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'> And it happened, at the end of three days, the officers passed into the midst of the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'> And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, and the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place and shall go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'> Only, keep a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. You shall not come near it, so that you may know the way in which you are to go. For you have not crossed over this way yesterday and the day before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'> And said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'> And spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and go before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'> And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel, so that they shall know that as I was with Moses, I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'> And you shall command the priests bearing the ark of the covenant, saying, When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan you shall stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'> And said to the sons of Israel, Come near here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'> And said, By this you shall know that the living God is among you. And He shall certainly expel from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'> Behold, the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of all the earth shall pass over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'> And now, take for yourselves twelve men out of the tribes of Israel one man for each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'> And it shall be, when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of Jehovah, Lord of all the earth, come to rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters which come down from above. And they shall stand in one heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'> And it happened, as the people moved from their tents to cross over the Jordan, and as the priests bore the ark of the covenant before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'> and as those bearing the ark came into the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the waters (and the Jordan was full, over all its banks all the days of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'> that the waters stood still, those coming down from above rose up into a heap, very far above the city Adam, which is beside Zaretan; and those going down by the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'> And the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan. And all Israel crossed over on dry ground until all the nation had completely passed over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'> And it happened, when all the nation had completely crossed over the Jordan, Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'> Take twelve men for you out of the people, one man of each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'> And charge them, saying, Take twelve stones from this place, from the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the feet of the priests were fixed. And you shall carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place which you stay the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'> And called to the twelve men whom he had readied from the sons of Israel, one man out of each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'> And said to them, Cross over before the ark of Jehovah your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each man of you lift up one stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'> that this shall be a sign among you, when your children ask hereafter, saying, What are these stones to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'> You shall say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as it crossed over into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones are for a memorial to the sons of Israel all the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'> And the sons of Israel did as commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and crossed over with them to the lodging place, and laid them down there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'> even the twelve stones that lifted up in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant stood firm. And they are there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'> And the priests bearing the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was finished everything that Jehovah had commanded to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastened and crossed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'> And it happened, when the people had finished crossing over, the ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'> And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle array before the sons of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'> about forty thousand armed men of the army crossed over before Jehovah for battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'> In that day Jehovah made great in the sight of all Israel. And they feared him all the days of his life, even as they feared Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'> And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'> Order the priests who carry the ark of the testimony, that they rise out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'> And commanded the priests, saying, Rise out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'> And it happened when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests had been lifted to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'> And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and camped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'> And the twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were raised up in Gilgal by Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'> And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons ask their fathers hereafter, saying, What do these stones mean ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'> Then you shall make your sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'> because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you crossed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which He dried up before you until we crossed over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'> so that all the people of the land shall know that the hand of Jehovah is strong, so that you may fear Jehovah your God all the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'> And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan, toward the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the sea, heard how Jehovah dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel, until they crossed over, their heart was melted. And there was not any more spirit in them before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'> At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make for yourself flint knives, and again circumcise the sons of Israel, the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'> And made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'> And this is the reason circumcised: All the people who had come out of Egypt, who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness, in the way, as they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'> For all the people who had come out were circumcised. And all the people who were born in the wilderness, in the way, as they came out from Egypt, had not been circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'> For the sons of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who had come out of Egypt were consumed, those who did not listen to the voice of Jehovah, to whom Jehovah had sworn to them not to show them the land which Jehovah swore to their fathers, to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey; these were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'> And He raised their sons up in their place. circumcised them, for they had been uncircumcised; for they had not been circumcised in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'> And it happened, when all the nation had finished being circumcised, they remained in their places in the camp until they revived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'> And Jehovah said to Joshua, Today I have rolled the reproach of Egypt off of you. And he called the name of that place Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'> And the sons of Israel camped in Gilgal, and prepared the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'> And they ate the old grain of the land on the morrow of the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain , in this same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'> And the manna ceased on the next day after they ate of the old grain of the land. And there was no more manna to the sons of Israel, but they ate the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'> And it happened, when was beside Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked. And, behold! A Man stood in front of him, and His drawn sword was in His hand. And went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us, or for our foes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'> And He said, No, for I now come as the Commander of the army of Jehovah. And fell on his face to the earth and worshiped. And he said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His slave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'> And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your shoe off your foot, for the place on which you are standing is holy. And did so.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'> And Jericho was closed, and was shut in from the face of the sons of Israel; no one going out, and no one coming in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'> And Jehovah said to Joshua, See I have given Jericho and its king, mighty warriors, into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'> And you shall go around the city, all the men of battle, going around the city once; so you shall do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'> And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark. And on the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'> And it shall be, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the ram's horn, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat; and the people shall go up, each man in front of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'> And the son of Nun called the priests and said to them Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'> And he said to the people, Pass on, go around the city, and he who is shall go on before the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'> And it happened, when spoke to the people, the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the ram's horns before Jehovah passed on and blew with the ram's horn. And the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'> And he who was armed went before the priests blowing the ram's horns. And the rear guard after the ark, going on and blowing with the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'> And had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout, nor cause your voice to be heard, nor shall there go from your mouth a word until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'> And the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around one time. And they came into the camp, and remained in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'> And rose early in the morning, and the priests bore the ark of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of the ram's horns were walking before the ark of Jehovah, going on, and were blowing with the rams' horns. And he who was armed went before them. And the rear guard went behind the ark of Jehovah, going on and blowing with the rams' horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'> And they circled the city on the second day one time, and returned to the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'> And it happened on the seventh day, they rose early, at the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same way. Only on that day they circled the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'> And it happened at the seventh time the priests blew with the rams' horns. And said to the people, Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city.</verse>
