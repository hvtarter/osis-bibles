  <div type='book' osisID='Dan'>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'> And the king spoke to Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs that he should bring some of the sons of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'> young men in whom was no blemish, but who were of good appearance and having understanding in all wisdom, having knowledge and understanding learning, even those with strength in them to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the writing and the language of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'> And the king set to them the portion of a day in its day, from the king's food, and the wine of his drinking, even to rear them three years, so that at their end they may stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'> And there were among them of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'> to whom the chief of the eunuchs gave names. For he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'> And laid on his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine of his drinking. So he asked of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'> And God had given kindness and compassion before the chief of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'> And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has chosen your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces worse looking than the boys who are in your term? Then you would forfeit my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'> And said to Melzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'> I beg you, test your servants ten days. And let vegetables be given to us that we may eat, and water that we may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'> Then let our face be seen before you, our look and the look of the boys who eat of the king's food. And as you see, deal so with your servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'> And he listened to them in this matter and tested them for ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'> And at the end of ten days their faces looked better and fatter of flesh than all the boys who were eating the king's food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'> So Melzar took away their food and the wine that they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'> As for these four boys, God gave them knowledge and skill in all writing and wisdom. And had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'> And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'> And the king talked with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'> And in any matter of wisdom and understanding that the king asked from them, he found them ten times better than. all the horoscopists and the conjurers who were in all his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'> And continued to the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar was dreaming dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep was finished on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'> And the king said to call to the horoscopists, and to the conjurers, and to the sorcerers and to the Chaldeans, to tell to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'> And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'> And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will reveal the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The word is certainly gone from me. If you will not make known the dream and its meaning to me, you will be made into mere members, and your houses shall be made an outhouse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'> But if you make known the dream, you shall receive gifts and a present and great honor from before me. Therefore, reveal the dream and its meaning to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'> They again replied and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will reveal its meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'> The king answered and said, For I know that you buy time, that on account of all, you see the thing is certainly gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'> But if you will not make the dream known to me, there is one law for you. For you have agreed upon lying and deceiving words to speak before me until the time has changed. Therefore, tell me the dream, then I shall know that you can reveal the meaning to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'> The Chaldeans replied before the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can reveal the king's matter, because not any king, lord, or ruler has asked such a thing from any horoscopist, or conjurer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'> And the thing that the king asks is rare. And there is no other who may reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'> Then the king was enraged and angered. And he commanded all the wise men of Babylon to be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'> And the law went out that the wise men should be killed. And they looked for and his companions, to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'> Then answered with counsel and insight to Arioch the chief of the king's bodyguard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'> He answered and said to Arioch, the king's officer, Why is the decree so hasty from before the king? And Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'> And went in and asked of the king that he would give him time, and he would show the king the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'> Then went to his house and declared the thing to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'> that they might pray for the mercies of God in Heaven about this secret, that and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'> Then the secret was revealed to in a night vision, and blessed the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'> answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'> And He changes the times and the seasons; He causes to pass away kings, and sets up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who know understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'> He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'> I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has made me know what we ask of You. For You have revealed to us the king's matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'> Then went in to Arioch, whom the king had chosen to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him, Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show the meaning to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'> Then Arioch quickly brought in before the king and spoke this to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make the meaning known to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to reveal to me the dream which I have seen, and its meaning?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'> replied before the king and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot be shown to the king by the wise men, the conjurers, the horoscopists, or the fortunetellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'> But there is a God in Heaven who reveals secrets, and makes known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'> As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen after this. And He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall occur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but so that the meaning might be made known to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'> You, O king, were seeing. And, behold, a certain great image! That great image stood before you with a brilliant brightness, and its form was dreadful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'> The head of this image was of fine gold, its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs were of bronze,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'> its legs were of iron, its feet were partly of iron and partly of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'> You continued until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were together broken to pieces, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away so that no place was found for them. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'> This is the dream, and we will tell the meaning of it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'> You O king are the king of kings. For the God of Heaven has given you the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'> And wherever the sons of men, the animals of the field, and the birds of the sky dwell, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'> And in your place shall arise another kingdom lower than yours, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'> And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron. Inasmuch as iron crushes and smashes all things, and as the iron that shatters all these, it will crush and shatter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'> And as to that you saw, the feet and the toes were partly of potters' clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it the strength of iron, because you saw the iron mixed with clay of the potter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'> And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'> And as you saw the iron mixed with the clay of the clay, they shall be mixed with the seed of men. But they shall not adhere to one another, even as iron does not mix with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'> And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people. It shall break in pieces and destroy all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'> Because you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold in pieces. The great God has made known to the king what shall occur after this. And the dream is certain, and the meaning of it is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'> Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and did homage to Daniel. And he commanded an offering, even to offer incense to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'> The king answered and said, Your God truly is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and a Revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'> Then the king made great and gave many great gifts to him. And he made him ruler over all the province of Babylon, and chief of the prefects over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'> And asked of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits; its breadth, six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges and the justices. And all the officials of the provinces were ordered to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'> Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'> Then the herald cried with strength: To you it is commanded O peoples, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'> at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'> And whoever does not fall down and worship, at that moment they will be thrown into the middle of a burning, fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'> Then at that time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down, worshiping the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'> Then at that time men, Chaldeans, came near and slandered the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'> They answered and said to king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'> You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'> And whoever does not fall down and worship, he should be thrown into the middle of a burning, fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'> There are men, Jews, whom you have set over the business of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not pay attention to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'> Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'> Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you are not serving my gods, nor worshiping the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'> Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and worship the image which I have made. But if you do not worship, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning, fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to return a word to you on this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'> If it is so that our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning, fiery furnace, then He will deliver out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'> And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'> Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usual to heat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'> And he commanded mighty men of valor in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the burning, fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'> Then these men were tied up in their slippers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning, fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'> Then, because the king's command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning, fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was amazed. And he rose up in haste; he spoke and said to his royal officials, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They replied and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'> He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm among them. And the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning, fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the most high God, come out and come here . Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'> And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's officials assembled. And they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power, and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their slippers changed, nor had the smell of fire clung on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'> Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king's words, and have given their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'> And a decree is given by me, that every people, nation, and language who speak anything amiss about the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, he will be made into mere members and his house shall be made an outhouse. Because there is no other God who is able to deliver like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'> Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'> Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, the nations, and the tongues that dwell in all the earth: Your peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'> It seemed good before me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'> How great are His signs! And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His rule is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'> I saw a dream, and it terrified me, and the thoughts on my bed and visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'> So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the meaning of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'> Then the horoscopists, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they did not make its meaning known to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'> But at last came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'> O Belteshazzar, master of the horoscopists, because I now that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'> As to the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and. behold, a tree was in the middle of the earth. And its height was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'> The tree became great and strong, and its height reached to the sky, and its appearance to the end of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'> Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all was in it. The animals of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'> I was looking in the visions of my head on my bed. And, behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from the heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'> He cried with might and said this: Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it, and the birds leave its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'> But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a fetter of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and his portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'> Let his heart be changed from man's, and let the heart of an animal be given to him. And let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'> This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the command by the word of the holy ones, so that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He will. And He sets up over it the lowest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'> I, Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its meaning, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to reveal the meaning to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'> Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, O Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream is to those who hate you, and its meaning is to your foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'> The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heaven and its appearance to all the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'> and its leaves being beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all being in it, under which the animals of the field lived, and in its branches the birds of the sky had their home:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'> It was you, O king, for you have become great and strong. For your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your rule is to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'> And as the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Cut the tree down, and destroy it. Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and his portion be with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'> This is the meaning, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'> And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. And you shall be fed with grass like oxen. And you shall be wet with dew of the heavens; and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and He gives it to whomever He desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'> And in that they that commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots, Your kingdom shall be enduring to you after you have realized that Heaven rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'> So, O king, let my advice be pleasing to you: Even break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by pitying the poor, whether there will be duration to your prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'> All this came on the king, Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'> At the end of twelve months, he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'> The king spoke and said, is this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'> The word was still in the king's voice when a voice fell from the heaven, saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has been taken from you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'> And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field. You shall be fed with the grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He gives it to whomever He desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'> The same hour the thing was fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and he ate the grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles' feathers , and his nails like birds' claws .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'> And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to the heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High. And I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His rule from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'> And all the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing. And He does according to His will among the army of Heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth. And no one is able to strike His hand or say to Him, What are You doing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'> At that time my reason returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my brightness returned to me. And my advisers and my nobles sought to me. And I was reestablished in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of Heaven, for all His works are truth, and His ways are justice. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'> And four great beasts came up from the sea, different from one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'> The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings. I watched until its wings were torn off. And it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'> And, behold, another beast, a second, like a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it, Rise up, eat much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'> After this I was looking, and, behold, another like a leopard, and to it were four wings of a bird on its side. And also to the beast were four heads. And rulership was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'> And after this I was looking in the night visions. And, behold, the fourth beast was fearful and terrifying, and very strong! And to it were great iron teeth. It devoured, and crushed, and stamped what was left with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'> I was thinking about the horns. And behold! Another little horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. And behold! In this horn were eyes like the eyes of the man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'> I was looking until the thrones were thrown up, and the Ancient of Days sat, whose robe was white as snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was like flames of fire, its wheels like burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'> A stream of fire went out and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and a myriad myriads stood before Him. The court was set and the books were opened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'> until the Ancient of Days came. And judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'> And He said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall devour all the earth, and shall trample it down and crush it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'> And I looked in the vision, and it happened when I looked that I was at Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam. And in a vision I looked, and I was by the Ulai Canal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'> Then I lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold! A ram was standing before the canal, having two horns. And the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'> I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, so that no beasts could stand before him, and none could deliver out of his hand. But he did according to his will and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'> And I was considering. And behold! A male of the goats came from the west, over the face of all the earth and did not touch the ground. And the he goat had an outstanding horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'> And he came to the ram with two horns which I had seen standing before the canal. And he ran to it in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'> And I saw him touched beside the ram. And he was moved with anger against him. And he struck the ram and shattered his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him. But he threw him down to the ground and trampled him. And no one could deliver the ram from his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'> Then the he goat became very great. And when he was mighty, the great horn was broken. And in its place came up four outstanding ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'> And out of one of them came a little horn which became very great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the bountiful land .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'> And it became great, even to the host of the heavens. And it caused some of the host and of the stars to fall to the ground, and it trampled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'> Yea, he magnified himself even to the leader of the host. And the regular sacrifice was taken away by him, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'> And a host was given with the regular sacrifice because of transgression. And it threw the truth down to the ground, and it worked and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'> Then I heard a certain holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that one who spoke, Until when is the vision, the regular sacrifice and the desolating transgression, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'> And he said to me, For two thousand, three hundred evenings and mornings, then the sanctuary will be vindicated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'> And it happened when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, then I sought the meaning. And, behold, the form of a man stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.16'> And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, and he called and said, Gabriel, make this one understand the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'> And he came beside my place. And when he came, I feared and fell on my face. But he said to me, O son of man, understand, for the vision is for the time of the end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'> In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'> in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood the number of the years by books, which came as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'> And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek by prayer and holy desires, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'> And I prayed to Jehovah my God. and made my confession, saying, O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and mercy of those who love Him, and to those who keep His commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'> we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done evilly, and we have rebelled, even by departing from Your commandments and from Your judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'> And we have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.7'> O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us the shame of our faces, as it is this day to the men of Judah, and to the dwellers of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near and who are afar through all the lands where You have scattered them for their unfaithfulness which they have done against You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.8'> O Lord, shame of face belongs to us, to our kings, to our rulers and to our fathers, because we have sinned against You.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.11'> Yea, all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside that they might not obey Your voice. For this reason the curse has poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'> And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us, and against our judges who judge us, by bringing on us a great evil. For under the whole heavens it has not been done as it has been done to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.13'> As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we did not make our prayer before Jehovah our God that we might turn from our perversities and understand Your truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.24'> Seventy weeks are decreed as to your people, and as to your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'> Know, then, and understand that from the going out of a word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem, to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in times of affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'> And after sixty two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself. And the people of a coming prince shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end shall be with the flood, and ruins are determined, and war shall be until the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'> And he shall confirm a covenant with the many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. And on a wing of the altar will be abominations that desolate, even until the end. And that which was decreed shall pour out on the desolator.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.10'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'> In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. And the thing was true, and a great conflict. And he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'> In those days, I, Daniel, was mourning three weeks of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'> I ate no food for delight, and no flesh or wine came into my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three weeks of days were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'> And in the twenty fourth day of the first month, as I was by the hand of the great river, which is Tigris,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'> then I lifted up my eyes and looked: And behold! A certain man was clothed in linen, whose loins were wrapped in fine gold from Uphaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'> His body was also like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes were like torches of fire; and his arms and his feet in color like polished bronze; and the sound of his words were as the noise of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'> And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision. But a great trembling fell on them so that they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'> Then I was left alone, and I saw his great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my glory was turned within me into corruption, and I kept no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'> Yet I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard the sound of his words, then I was on my face, stunned, and my face was toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'> And, behold, a hand touched me and set me shaking on my knees and the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'> And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you and stand up. For I am now sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'> And he said to me, Do not fear, Daniel. For from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'> But the king of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty one days. But, lo, Michael, one of the first rulers, came to help me. And I stayed there with the kings of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.14'> Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.15'> And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face to the ground, and I became speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'> And, behold, one in form as the sons of men touched my lips. And I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O lord, my pangs have come over me because of the vision, and I have no strength left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'> For how can the servant of my lord speak this with this my lord? For as for me, there is no power left in me; yea, there is no breath left in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.18'> And again one in form as a man touched me and made me strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.19'> And he said, O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace to you. Be strong. Yea, be strong! And when he had spoken to me I was made strong. And I said, Speak, my lord, for you have made me strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.20'> And he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I have gone out, then, lo, the ruler of Greece shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.21'> But I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. And no one makes himself strong with Me in these things except Michael your ruler.</verse>
