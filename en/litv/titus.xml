  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'> Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of the elect of God and full knowledge of the truth according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'> on hope of eternal life which the God who does not lie promised before the eternal times,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'> but revealed in its own times in a proclamation of His word, with which I was entrusted by the command of our Savior God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'> to Titus, a true child according to our common faith. Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'> For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I ordered you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'> If anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of loose behavior, or disobedient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'> (for the overseer must be blameless as a steward of God), not self-pleasing, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not a quarreler, not greedy of ill gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'> but hospitable, a lover of good, discreet, just, holy, temperate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'> clinging to the faithful word according to the teaching, that he may be able both to encourage by sound doctrine and to convict the ones contradicting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'> For there are indeed many disobedient men, empty talkers and mind-deluders, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'> whose mouth you must stop, who overturn whole houses, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of ill gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'> One of them, a prophet of their own, said: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'> This testimony is true; for which cause convict them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'> not listening to Jewish myths and commandments of men, having turned away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'> Truly, all things are pure to the pure, but to the ones having been defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience has been defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'> They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him , being abominable and disobedient, and worthless to every good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'> But you speak things which become sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'> aged men to be temperate, sensible, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'> aged women likewise in reverent behavior, not slanderers, not having been enslaved by much wine, teachers of good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'> that they might train the young women to be lovers of husbands, lovers of children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'> the younger men in the same way exhort to be discreet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'> having shown yourself a pattern of good works about all things in doctrine, in purity, sensibleness, incorruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>  in sound speech, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may he ashamed, having nothing bad to say about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'> Let slaves be subject to their own masters, well-pleasing in all things , not speaking against them ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'> not stealing, but showing all good faith, that they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'> For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'> instructing us that having denied ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live discreetly and righteously and godly in the present age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'> looking for the blessed hope and appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'> who gave Himself on our behalf, "that He might redeem us from all iniquity" "and purify" "a people" "for His own possession," zealous of good works. Psa. 130:8; Eze. 37:23; Deut. 14:2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'> Speak these things and exhort and convict with all authority. Let no one despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'> Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready in every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'> to speak evil of no one, not quarrelsome, but forbearing, having displayed all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'> For we also once were senseless, disobedient, led astray, slaving for various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'> But when the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'> not by works in righteousness which we had done, but according to His mercy, He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'> whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'> that being justified by His grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'> Faithful is the Word, and concerning these things I desire you strongly to affirm that the ones believing God should take thought to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'> But keep back from foolish questionings and genealogies and arguments and quarrels of law, for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'> After the first and second warning, avoid a man of heresy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'> knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'> When I shall send Artemas to you or Tychicus, hasten to come to me at Nicopolis. For I have decided to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'> Diligently set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, that nothing be lacking to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be without fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'> All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
