      <chapter osisID='Hab.1'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.1'> The burden which the prophet saw:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.2'> O Jehovah, until when shall I cry for help, and You will not hear? I cry out to You, Violence! But You do not save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.3'> Why do You show me evil, and You look upon toil? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.4'> On account of this the law has become helpless, and justice does not continually go forth. For the wicked hems in the righteous, so justice goes forth, being perverted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.5'> Look among the nations and see, and be amazed. Be amazed! For a work is working in your days which you will not believe, though it be told to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.6'> For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, the bitter and impetuous nation which is going into the broad spaces of the land, to possess dwellings not his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.7'> He is terrible and fearful; his judgment and his glory comes from himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.8'> His horses also are swifter than leopards and are fiercer than the evening wolves. And their horsemen spread themselves; yea, their horsemen come from afar; they shall fly as the eagle hurrying to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.9'> All of him shall come for violence; the gathering of their faces is forward; and they gather captives like the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.10'> And he shall scoff against the kings, and officials shall be a scorn to him. He shall scorn every fortress, and he shall heap up dirt and capture it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.11'> Then he sweeps on like a wind; and he transgresses and is guilty, crediting this power of his to his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.12'>  Are You not from of old, Jehovah our God, my Holy One? We shall not die, Jehovah, for You have appointed him for judgment. And, my Rock, You have established him for correction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.13'>  You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and You are not able to look upon vexation. Why do you look on those who deal deceitfully? Will You be silent when the wicked swallows one more righteous than he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.14'> For You make man like the fish of the sea, like creeping things with no ruler over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.15'> He takes up all of him with the hook; he drags him with his net and gathers him with his seine. On account of this he rejoices and exults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.16'> So he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his seine; because by them his portion is fat, and his food rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.1.17'> Shall he therefore empty his net, and shall he not spare to continually slay nations?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.1'> I will stand on my guard and set myself on the tower, and watch to see what He will say against me, and what I shall return on my rebuke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.2'> And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision and engrave it on the tablets, that he who reads it may run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.3'> For the vision is still for the appointed time, but it breathes to the end, and it does not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, because it will surely come; it will not tarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.4'> Behold, the soul of him is puffed up and is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.5'> And also, wine indeed betrays a proud man, and he is not content; who widens his soul like Sheol. And he is like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all the nations to himself, and collects all the peoples to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.6'> Shall not all of these lift up a parable against him. and a mocking riddle to him, and say, Woe to him who increases what is not his! How long, then, shall he load the pledges on himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.7'> Shall not those who strike you rise up suddenly, and those who shake you be aroused, and you become a prize to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.8'> Because you have plundered many nations, all the rest of the people shall plunder you, because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, and the city, and all those dwelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.9'> Woe to him who robs evil booty for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.10'> You have advised shame for your house, to make an end of many peoples, and are sinning in your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.11'> For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam shall answer it from the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.12'> Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.13'> Behold, is it not for Jehovah of hosts that the people labor only for fire? Yea, nations weary themselves only for vanity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.14'> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.15'> Woe to him who causes his friend to drink, pouring out your wineskin, and also making him drunk, so as to look upon their nakedness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.16'> You are filled with shame instead of glory; you drink also, and will be seen as uncircumcised. The cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall turn on you, and disgrace shall be your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.17'> For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the ruin of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, the city, and all those dwelling in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.18'> What does an image profit, for its maker has carved it; a molten image, and a teacher of falsehood? For does the maker trust in his work on it, to make mute idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.19'> Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake! To a mute stone, Rise up, it shall teach! Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but no breath is in its midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.2.20'> But Jehovah is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hab.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.1'> A prayer of the prophet concerning erring ones:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.2'> Jehovah, I have heard Your report; I am afraid, Jehovah. Give new life to Your work in the midst of years, in the midst of years make known; in anger remember compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.3'> God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His majesty covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.4'> And His brightness is as the light; rays from His hand are His, and there was a covering of His strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.5'> A plague goes before Him, and lightning went forth at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.6'> He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations; and the ancient mountains were shattered; the eternal hills bowed down. The goings of eternity are His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.7'> I saw the tents of Cushan under calamity; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.8'> Did Jehovah burn against rivers? Or was Your anger against the rivers? Or Your fury against the sea? For You ride on horses; Your chariots of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.9'> You bare Your bow, naked according to the oaths of the rods of Your word. Selah. You have cut through the earth with rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.10'> They saw You; mountains trembled. The storm of water passed over. The deep gave its voice and lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.11'> The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they go, at the shining of Your gleaming spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.12'> You march into the land in fury. You thresh nations in anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.13'> You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked to bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.14'> You pierced the head of his warriors with his shafts. They rush to scatter me; their rejoicing is to devour the meek in a secret place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.15'> You trod in the sea with Your horses, the foaming of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.16'> I heard, and my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled within myself that I might rest for the day of distress; to come up against the peoples; he cuts him off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.17'> Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the work of the olive fails, and the fields make no food; the flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd is in the stalls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.18'> yet I will exult in Jehovah; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hab.3.19'> Jehovah the Lord is my might, and He sets my feet like hinds' feet , and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer, on my stringed instruments.</verse>
