      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'> The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'> Beloved, in regard to all things, I pray for you to prosper and to be in health, as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'> For I rejoiced greatly at the coming of the brothers, also bearing witness of you in the truth, as you walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'> I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear my children are walking in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'> Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you work for the brothers and for the strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'> who in love bore witness of you before the church, whom you will do well to send forward worthily of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'> For on behalf of His name they went out, taking nothing from the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'> Therefore, we ought to entertain such men , that we may become co-workers in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'> I wrote to the church, but he loving to be first of them, Diotrephes, does not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'> Because of this, if I come, I will recall his works which he does, ranting against us with evil words. And not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers; and those intending it he prevents, and thrusts them out from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'> Beloved, do not imitate the bad, but the good. The one doing good is of God; but the one doing bad has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'> Witness has been borne to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'> I had many things to write, but I do not desire to write by means of pen and ink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'> But I am hoping to see you at once, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
