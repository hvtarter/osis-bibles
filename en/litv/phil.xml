  <div type='book' osisID='Phil'>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'> Paul, and Timothy, slaves of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and ministers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'> I thank my God on all the remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'> always in my every prayer on your behalf making my prayer with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'> over your fellowship in the gospel, from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'> being persuaded of this very thing, that the One having begun a good work in you will finish it until the day of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'> as it is righteous for me to think this of you all because you have me in your heart, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all sharers of the grace with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'> For God is my witness how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'> And this I pray, that your love may yet abound more and more in full knowledge and all perception,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'> for you to distinguish the things that differ, that you may be sincere and without blame for the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'> being filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'> But I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have more fully come to the advancement of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'> so that in all the praetorium, and to all the rest, my bonds have become clearly revealed to be in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'> And the most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident in my bonds, more exceedingly dare to speak the word fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'> Some, indeed, even proclaim Christ because of envy and strife, but some also because of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'> These, indeed, announce Christ out of party spirit, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'> But these others out of love, knowing that I am set for defense of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'> For what? Yet in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is announced, and I rejoice in this; yet also I will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'> For I know that this will result in deliverance to me through your petition and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Job 13:16</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but as always in all boldness even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'> But if I live in the flesh, this to me is fruit of my labor, and what I shall choose I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'> For I am pressed together by the two: having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'> but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on account of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'> And being persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with you all for your advancement and joy of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'> so that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'> Only behave yourself worthily of the gospel of Christ, so that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I hear the things concerning you, that you stand fast in one spirit and one soul, striving together in the faith of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'> and not being terrified in anything by those who oppose, which to them truly is a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and this from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'> because it was granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'> having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'> Then if there is any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tendernesses and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'> fulfill my joy, that you think the same, having the same love, one in soul, minding the one thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>  doing nothing according to party spirit or self-glory, but in humility, esteeming one another to surpass themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'> each not looking at their own things, but each also at the things of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'> For let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'> who subsisting in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'> but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, having become in the likeness of men</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'> and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, having become obedient until death, even the death of a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'> Because of this also God highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'> that at the name of Jesus "every knee should bow," of heavenly ones, and earthly ones, and ones under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'> and "every tongue should confess" that Jesus Christ is "Lord," to the glory of God the Father. Isa. 45:23</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'> So, then, my beloved, even as you always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, cultivate your salvation with fear and trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'> for it is God who is working in you both to will and to work for the sake of His good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'> Do all things without murmurings and disputings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'> that you may be blameless and harmless, children of God, without fault in the midst of a crooked generation, even having been perverted, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'> holding up a word of life, for a boast to me in the day of Christ, that I ran not in vain, nor labored in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'> But if indeed I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice; yea, I rejoice with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'> And you also rejoice in the same and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I may also be of good cheer, knowing the things about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'> For I have no one like-minded, who genuinely will care for the things about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'> For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'> But you know the proof of him, that as a child to a father, he served with me for the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'> Then I hope to send this one at once, whenever I shall see the things about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'> But I thought it needful to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker, and my fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister of my need,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'> since he was longing for you all and has been troubled because you heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'> For indeed he was sick, coming near to death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him, but also me, lest I should have grief on grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'> Therefore, I sent him more eagerly, that seeing him again you may rejoice, and I may be less grieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'> Then receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold such in honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'> that through the work of Christ he drew near to death, having disregarded his life, that he may fill up your lack of service toward me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'> For the rest my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you truly is not tiresome to me, but safe for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'> Look out for the dogs, look out for the evil workers, look out for the concision party .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'> For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God, and who glory in Christ Jesus, and who do not trust in flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'> Though I also might have trust in flesh; if any other thinks to trust in flesh, I more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'> in circumcision, the eighth day, of the race of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to Law, a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'> according to zeal, persecuting the church; according to righteousness in Law, being blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'> But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'> But, nay, rather I also count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them to be trash, that I might gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'> and be found in Him; not having my own righteousness of Law, but through the faith of Christ, having the righteousness of God on faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'> to know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, having been conformed to His death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'> if somehow I may attain to a resurrection out of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'> Not that I already received or already have been perfected, but I press on, if I also may lay hold, inasmuch as I also was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'> Brothers, I do not count myself to have laid hold, but one thing I do , forgetting the things behind, and stretching forward to those things before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'> I press on after the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'> Then as many as are perfect, let us be of this mind; and if you think anything differently, God will also reveal this to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'> Yet as to where we have arrived, walk by the same rule, being of the same mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'> Be fellow-imitators of me, brothers, and consider those walking this way, even as you have us for a pattern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'> For many walk as the enemies of the cross of Christ, of whom I often told you, and now even weeping I say it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'> whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and who glory in their shame, those who mind earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'> For our citizenship is in Heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'> who will transform our body of humiliation, for it to be conformed to His body of glory, according to the working of His power, even to put all things under Himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'> So as, my brothers, ones loved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'> I entreat Euodias, and I entreat Syntyche, to mind the same thing in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'> And I also ask you, true yoke-fellow, help those who struggled along with me and with Clement in the gospel, and the rest, fellow-workers with me, whose names are in the Scroll of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'> Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, Rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'> Let your reasonableness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and by petition with thanksgivings, let your requests be made known to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'> and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'> For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever honorable, whatever is right, whatever pure, whatever lovely, whatever of good report, if of any virtue, and if of any praise, think on these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'> And what things you learned and received and heard and saw in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you revived your thinking of me (although you indeed did think, but lacked opportunity).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'> Not that I speak as to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'> But I know to be humbled, and I know to abound; in everything, and in all things, I am taught both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound, and to lack.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'> I can do all things through Christ, the One giving me power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'> Yet you did well in sharing my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'> And you know, too, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'> Because truly in Thessalonica you sent to my need, both once and twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'> Not that I seek a gift, but I seek the fruit multiplying to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'> But I have all things and more than enough; I have been filled, receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you , an odor of sweet smell, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'> And my God will fill your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'> Now may glory be to our God and Father forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'> All the saints greet you, most of all those of Caesar's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.</verse>
