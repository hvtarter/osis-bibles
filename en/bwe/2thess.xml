        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='2Thess'>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy send greetings to the church people in the city of Thessalonica. This church belongs to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, in their kindness, give you much happiness and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>My brothers, we thank God for you always. It is the right thing to do. You trust him more and more. You all love each other more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>So we are proud of you. We tell the churches of God about you because you are standing strong and you keep on believing in God. Your troubles and hard times do not stop you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>This proves that God will judge right. And he will say that you are good enough for the kingdom of God because you suffer for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>God will do what is right. He will give trouble to those who are troubling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>And he will give rest to you who are having troubles, and to us also. He will give this rest when our Lord Jesus comes back from heaven. The Lord Jesus will come with his strong angels in flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>He will punish those who do not know God, and those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>They will be destroyed for ever. That will be their punishment. They will be for ever separated from the Lord and from his great and wonderful power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>This will happen on the day he comes. On that day his people will show how great and wonderful he is. And all those who have believed in him will be surprised at how great he is. That means you also, because you believed what we told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>That is why we always talk to God about you. We want our God to make you fit for the good work to which he called you. We ask him to finish his good work of faith which trusts in his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>In that way you will make the name of our Lord Jesus Christ great. And he will make you great. This will be because of the kindness of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>My brothers, we want to talk to you about the time when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again and we are taken to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>Do not let your minds be easily upset. Do not be troubled by a spirit, or a message, or a letter. Do not be troubled if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come. Some people will say it came from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Do not let anyone fool you in any way. Before the day of the Lord comes, many people will stop believing God. The Man of Evil will be seen. He is the evil one who will be destroyed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>He will put himself against God. He will put himself above everything to do with God, and above everything that people worship. He will sit in Gods holy place and tell people that he is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>You remember that I told you these things when I was still with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And you know what is holding that evil man back. He will not be seen until it is his time to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>The plan to make people wrong has already begun to work. But someone is holding back that plan. He will stop the law-breaker for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>Then that evil man will be seen. The Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath from his mouth. The coming of the Lord Jesus will be so bright and wonderful that it will put the evil man to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>The coming of the evil man is the work of Satan. He will come in great power with signs that are not true, and wonderful things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>And by his bad tricks he will fool people who are lost. They will not love the true message which would have saved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>That is why God lets them be fooled so that they will believe what is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>They will all be judged. I mean the people who have not believed in the true message but who wanted to do what is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>My brothers, the Lord loves you. We should thank God for you always. Here is why.  From the beginning God chose you to be saved. You were saved because the Spirit made you holy and because you believed the true message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>God called you to be saved by the good news we brought you. He did this so that you would have some of the honour which the Lord Jesus Christ has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>So my brothers, be strong. Hold on to the things we taught you by our words or by letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>God has loved us and made us happy through his kindness. He gave us everlasting comfort and good hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, comfort your hearts and make you strong to do and say everything that is good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>My brothers, please talk to God about us. Ask God that the Lords message may reach many people quickly and that they may receive it gladly as you did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>Ask God that we may be saved from bad people who do wrong things. Not everyone believes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord can be trusted. He will make you strong. He will keep you safe from all that is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>The Lord makes us feel sure about you. We are sure that you are doing, and will do,  what we tell you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>May the Lord lead you to love God and be patient like Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>Now, my brothers, we tell you to do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Have nothing to do with any lazy brother who is not living the way we taught you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>You yourselves know how you should be like us. We were not lazy when we were with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>We did not eat anyones food without paying for it. But we worked very hard day and night because we did not want to trouble any one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>We have the right to be helped. But we wanted to show you what you should do in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>Even when we were with you, we told you this, If any man will not work, do not let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>We hear that some of you are lazy. You do not work, but you trouble other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>We say to such lazy people, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Do your work quietly.  Earn your own food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>My brothers, do not get tired of doing what is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>If any one will not obey what we say in this letter, look at that man and remember him.  Have nothing to do with him, so that he will be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Do not treat him like an enemy. Tell him, as you would tell a brother, what he should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>The Lord gives peace. May he give his peace to you at all times in every way. May the Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>I, Paul, write these words of greeting with my own hand. This is the sign in all my letters that I wrote them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
