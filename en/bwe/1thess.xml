        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>The good news we brought you was not just words. It had power. It had the Holy Spirit.  It made people very sure it was true. And you also know how we lived when we were with you to help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>You tried hard to be like us and like the Lord. You had much trouble because you believed our message. Yet the Holy Spirit made you very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>You have shown all the Christians in the countries of Macedonia and Greece how they should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>People in Macedonia and Greece have heard from you the message about the Lord. And people everywhere have heard that you believe in God. So there is no need for us to write about your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>They tell us how glad you were to see us. They tell us about how you left your idols and turned to God. You worship the God who is the living and true God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>My brothers, you yourselves know that our visit to you was not for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>The people at the city of Philippi treated us very badly. As you know, we had much trouble. But God helped us, and we did not fear to tell you Gods good news. But many things were against us and tried to stop us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>Our message was not a lie. What we told you was not wrong. And we did not try to fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But God chose us to tell people the good news. And so we do not speak to please men,  but to please God. He is the one who knows what is in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>We never said nice things about people that were not true. You know this. We never talked to get something out of it for ourselves. God knows this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>And we did not ask you or anybody else to help us or to praise us. Of course, we are apostles of Christ, and we had the right to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we were kind when we were with you. We were like a woman taking care of her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>Because we loved you, we were glad to give you Gods good news. We were also glad to give you our lives, because we loved you very much.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>We lived in a holy and right way among you Christians. We did nothing wrong to you.  You know this yourselves and God knows it too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>You know how we talked to each of you as a father talks to his children. We comforted,  helped, and taught you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>We told you to live to please God. He called you to his own kingdom and greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>And here is another reason why we always thank God all the time. When you heard Gods word from us, you did not say, That is mens word. But you said, That is Gods word. And it really is Gods word. The word is working in you Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>My brothers, you were like the churches of God in Judea which belong to Christ Jesus.  The people of your own country troubled you in the same way that the Jews troubled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>The Jewish leaders killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets. And they drove us out of their country. They do not please God and they are against all other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>They try to stop us from talking to those people who are not Jews. They do not want them to be saved. So they are always doing wrong things. And now at last, God has become very angry with them. have been away from you for a short time in body, but not in heart. We wanted very much to see you face to face, and we tried hard to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>We wanted to come to you. Twice, I, Paul, wanted to come. But Satan stopped us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>We felt we could not wait any longer. So we thought it best to stay at the city of Athens alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>And we sent our brother Timothy to you. He works for God by telling the good news about Christ. We sent him to help you be strong and to encourage you in what you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>We do not want anyone to give up because of the trouble. You yourselves know that we all will surely have trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>When we were with you, we told you that we would have trouble. Trouble came. And now you know what we said is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>That is why I could not wait any longer. I sent Timothy to find out if you were still believing. I was afraid that Satan had tried you too much. Then our work would have been for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now Timothy has come back to us from you. He has brought us the good news that you are still believing and have love in your hearts. He has told us that you always remember us. He also told us that you want to see us, just as we want to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>My brothers, the way you believe has comforted us in all our troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>It gives us new life now to know that you are standing strong in the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>You know what we told you through the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>So anyone who does not obey is not just disobeying a man, but he is disobeying God.  And it is God who has given us his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>You do not need anyone to write to you about how to love each other. God himself has taught you to be loving towards each other.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>We believe that Jesus died and rose again. And because of what Jesus did, God will bring back with him those who have died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Then we who are still alive on earth will be caught up together with those who were dead. We will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And then we will be with the Lord forever!</verse>
