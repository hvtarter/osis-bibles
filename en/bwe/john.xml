        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='John'>
      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>The Word already was, way back before anything began to be. The Word and God were together. The Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>Before anything began to be, the Word was there with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>God made everything by the Word. Nothing has been made without him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>Life was in the Word. That life was Light for people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>The Light shone where it was dark and the darkness did not stop the Light from shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>God sent a man named John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came to talk about the Light, so that all people might believe in the Light by what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He himself was not that Light, but he was sent to talk about the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true Light which gives light to every person who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He, the Word, was in the world. Yes, he even made the world. And yet the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came into the world that was his own, but his own people did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But there were people who did believe in his name. They did receive him. He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>They were born into Gods family by God. That is, they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world. It was not by any persons will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>The Word became man and he lived among us. We saw with our own eyes that he is great. He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great. We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John talked about him. He called out saying, Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>He was full of loving kindness, and we have all received so much kindness from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>Moses gave the law, but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God. But his only Son is very near to his Fathers heart. He has told us plainly about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked John, Who are you? John told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He did not hide the truth, but he told people plainly. He said, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>So they asked him, Well then, are you Elijah? He answered, No, I am not. They asked,  Are you the Prophet? He answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then those priests said, Who are you? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>John said, I am a voice calling in the desert, "Make the road straight for the Lord." This is what was said by Isaiah, the prophet of God long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>So they asked him, If you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why then are you baptizing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered, I baptize people in water. But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am. I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming to him. Look, said John. See Gods special Lamb!  He takes away the wrong ways of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I myself did not know who he was. But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also said, I saw the Spirit coming from the sky. He came down on him like a dove.  It stayed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I myself did not know who he was. But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me. He said, "You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man. That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>I saw the Spirit coming on him, and I have told you. This man is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day, John was standing with two of his followers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>Jesus walked by. When John saw him, he said, Look, see Gods Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two followers heard what John said, so they went after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Jesus turned. He saw them coming after him. He said to them, What are you looking for? They said, Teacher, where do you live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>Jesus said, Come and see. They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying. The time was about four oclock in the afternoon. They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus. He was Simon Peters brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon. He said, We have found the Messiah! (Messiah means the Christ, the messenger of God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas. (Cephas means Peter, a rock or stone.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day Jesus said, I will go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, Come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were also from that town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip went to find Nathanael. He said We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law. The prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, from Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathanael said, From Nazareth? Can any good thing come from there? Philip said,  Come and see for yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said, Here is a man who is truly of Israel. He does not fool people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael asked, How do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree. That was before Philip called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael said, Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered, I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. Is that why you believe in me now? You will see more wonderful things than that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>I tell you the truth, said Jesus. You will see heaven open. You will see Gods angels going up and down to the Son of Man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in the country of Galilee. Jesus  mother was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus and his disciples were also asked to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>The people needed more wine. Then Jesus mother said to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said, Woman, why are you telling me about it? It is not yet the time for me to do something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Do all that he tells you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Six very large water pots made of stone were standing there. The pots were there because the Jews had a certain law about washing themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said, Fill the pots with water. So they filled them to the very top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Jesus said, Now take some out. Carry it to the one in charge of the feast. They did what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>The man in charge of the feast tasted the water that was now turned into wine. He did not know where it came from, but the servants who drew the water knew. When the man had tasted it, he called the man who was being married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>He said, Other people give the good wine at the beginning of the feast. When people have had all they want, then they give the wine which is not so good. But you have kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This was the first big work that Jesus did. It was in Cana in Galilee. He showed that he was great. And his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went to the town called Capernaum. His mother, his brothers, and his disciples also went with him. They stayed there for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. So Jesus went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the temple he found people buying and selling things. They were selling cows, sheep,  and doves. Others were sitting at tables changing money for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>Jesus tied some pieces of cord together to make a whip. Then he drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. And he drove out the sheep and the cows. He threw down the tables of the money changers and their money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>He said to the people who sold doves, Take these things out of here. Do not make my Fathers house into a market place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that Gods word says, My love for your house is like a fire burning in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The leaders of the Jews said to Jesus, Who gave you the right to do this? What big work will prove it to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them, Break down this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jewish leaders said, It took forty-six years to build this temple. Do you say you will raise it in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But Jesus was talking about the temple which was his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>After Jesus died and had been raised from death, the disciples remembered that he had said this to them. Then they believed what the holy writings say. They also believed what Jesus had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Many people believed in Jesus name when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast.  They believed in him because they saw the big works he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus would not trust himself to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>He knew what all people are like. He did not need anyone to tell him about any person,  because he knew what was in a persons heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, a ruler and leader of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>One night Nicodemus came to Jesus. He said, Master, we know you are a teacher sent by God. We know this because no person could do the big works you are doing if God did not help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. No person can see Gods kingdom if he is not born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he go inside of his mother again and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This new birth is by water and by the Spirit. No person can enter Gods kingdom if he has not been born that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of a person is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>You must not be surprised when I say, "You must be born again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it wants to blow. You can hear the sound of it. But you do not know where it comes from, and you do not know where it goes. It is the same way with everyone who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus asked Jesus, How can such things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered, Are you a teacher of the people of Israel and you do not know this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>I tell you the truth. We know what we are talking about. We talk about the things we have seen. But you will not believe what we tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>You do not believe what I have told you about things on earth. So how will you believe if I tell you about things in heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ever gone up to heaven-only the One who came down from heaven. That One is the Son of Man who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>Moses lifted up a snake on a piece of wood in the desert. So the Son of Man must be lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>Then everyone who believes in him will not die, but will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>God loved the world so very, very much that he gave his only Son. Because he did that,  everyone who believes in him will not lose his life, but will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world. He sent him to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>Everyone who believes in the Son will not be judged. But everyone who does not believe in him is judged already, because he does not believe in the name of Gods only Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>Light came into the world. But people wanted to be in the dark because they did wrong things. They did not want the light. That is why they are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>Everyone who does wrong things hates light. He does not come to the light because he is afraid people will see what he does and will say it is bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But everyone who does what is right comes to the light. He wants people to see that God helps him to do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus and his disciples came into the country of Judea. Jesus stayed there with them and baptized people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John was also baptizing people in the river at Aenon, near the town of Salim. There was much water. People came to him and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>This was before John was put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Johns disciples and the leaders of the Jews were talking about how to be clean, the way God wants us to be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>They came to John and said, Teacher, there was a man with you on the other side of the Jordan River. You were telling people about him. Now he himself is baptizing and all the people are going to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, A man cannot get anything unless God in heaven gives it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves heard what I said. I am not the Christ but I have been sent ahead of the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The wife belongs to the man who has married her. The mans best friend may stand and listen. And when he hears what that man says, he is very glad for him. So what I hear makes me very glad in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must become more and more great, but I must become less and less great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>The one who comes from heaven is greater than all other people. The one who is of the earth talks about things on earth. So the one who comes from heaven is greater than all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He tells what he has seen and heard, but no one wants to believe what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>If a person believes what the one from heaven says, then he also says God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>The one God sent speaks the words of God. God does not give him the Spirit little by little, but he gives the Spirit in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves his Son and has put everything in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son will live for ever. He who does not believe in the Son will not live. God will be very angry with him for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>The Pharisees heard that Jesus was getting people to follow him and was baptizing them.  (Jesus disciples baptized them, not he himself.) He now had more followers than John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>The Lord knew that they had heard about it. So he left Judea and went back to Galilee again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He had to pass through the country of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>He came to a town in Samaria called Sychar. It was near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Jacobs well was there. Jesus was very tired from walking on the road. So he sat down by the well. It was about midday.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>A woman from Samaria came to the well to draw water. Jesus said, Please give me a drink of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>His disciples had gone into the town to buy some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>The woman said to Jesus, Why do you ask me for a drink of water? You are a Jew and I am from Samaria. (The Jews are not friends with the people of Samaria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Jesus answered her, You do not know what God gives people. And you do not know who is asking you for a drink. If you knew him, then it is you who would have asked for a drink of water. He would give you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>The woman said, Sir, you have nothing to draw with. The well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>Are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well? He drank water from this well, also his children and cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Jesus answered her, Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>But anyone who drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirsty. The water I give him will become a well inside of him that will never be dry. It will give him life for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>The woman said, Sir, give me this water. Then I will never be thirsty again. I will not need to come here to draw water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>Jesus said, Go, call your husband, then come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>She said, I have no husband. Jesus said, You say, "I have no husband." That is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>You have had five husbands, but the man you are living with now is not your husband.  You have told the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>The woman said, Sir, this shows me you are a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>Our fathers came to this mountain to worship God. But you people say Jerusalem is the place people must go to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Jesus said, Woman, believe what I say. The time is coming when you will not come to this mountain or to Jerusalem to worship my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>You worship one whom you do not know. But we know whom we worship. The Saviour will come of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>But the time is coming, yes, the time is here already, when those who worship God will worship him in spirit and in a true way. My Father is looking for that kind of people to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>God is Spirit. Those who worship him must do so in spirit and in a true way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>The woman said to Jesus, I know that Messiah is coming. His name is Christ. When he comes he will tell us everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>Jesus said to her, I who am talking to you am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>When Jesus had said this, his disciples came back. They were surprised to hear him talking to a woman. But not one of them asked, What do you want? or, Why are you talking to her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>The woman left her water-pot and went back to the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>She said to the people, Come, I will show you a man who has told me everything I have done. Can this be the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>The people left the town and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>While they were on the way coming to Jesus, the disciples asked him, Teacher, will you please eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Jesus said to them, I have food that you do not know about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>So the disciples asked one another, Has anyone brought him food to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Jesus said to them, My food is to obey the one who sent me and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Do you not say, "In four months it will be harvest time"? Listen, I say. Look up and see the fields. The harvest is ready to cut now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>The one who gathers the harvest receives a reward for it. He gathers a harvest that will live for ever. Then the one who sows and the one who gathers will both be happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>This saying is true here: "One sows and another gathers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>I sent you to gather what you did not help to plant. Other people have worked hard and you have been helped through their work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>Many of the people of the town believed in Jesus because of what the woman told them.  She said, He told me everything I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>When the people from Samaria came, they begged him to stay with them. So he stayed with them for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>Many more people believed in Jesus because of his own word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>They said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you told us, but because of what he himself has told us. We know it is true. This is the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>Two days after this, Jesus left Samaria and went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Jesus himself said, No prophet is honoured by the people in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>When he came to Galilee, the people of that country were glad to see him. They had seen all the things he did when he was at the feast in Jerusalem. They had been at the feast also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So Jesus came back to the town of Cana in Galilee. That was the place where he had changed water into wine. One of the kings officers was there. His son was sick in the town of Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, and he went to Jesus and said, I beg you, come and heal my son. He is dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>Jesus said to him, If you do not see some signs and big works, then you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>The officer said, Sir, I beg you. Come right away before my son dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>Jesus said, Go home. Your son will not die. The man believed what Jesus said and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>On the way, his servants met him. They said, Your son is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>He asked, What time did he begin to get well? They said, Yesterday at one hour after midday the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>The father knew that was the time when Jesus said to him Your son will not die. So he and all his family believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>This was the second big work that Jesus did after he came back from Judea to Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After that, the Jews had a feast and Jesus went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>In Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a wide water hole. The Jews called this water hole Bethesda. It had five places with roofs for people to stand under.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>Many sick people were lying on these places. Some of them were blind. Some were lame. Some were very thin and stiff so that they could not move by themselves. All of them were waiting for the water to move.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>An angel came down into the water at a certain time and made it move. The first person who stepped into the water when it moved was healed of any sickness that he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>A man was there who had been sick for thirty eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus saw the man lying there. He knew that he had been sick for a long time. He said to him, Do you want to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man said to him, Sir, I have no man to put me into the water when it moves.  While I am trying to get in, some other person comes and gets in before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said, Get up. Take up your bed and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>The man was healed right away. He took up his bed and walked. This happened on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the leaders of the Jews talked to the man who was healed. They said, It is the Sabbath day. It is not right for you to carry your bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, The man who healed me said to me, "Take up your bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, Who is the man who told you to take up your bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>The man who was healed said, I do not know who he is. Many people were at the place and Jesus had gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After that, Jesus saw the man in the temple. He said to him, See, you are healed. Do no more wrong things. If you do, something worse may happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and told the leaders of the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>The Jewish leaders made trouble for Jesus because he did this on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father is still working and I am working also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>This was why the leaders of the Jews tried much more to kill Jesus. He had broken the law of the Sabbath day. And also he called God his Father. In that way, he was making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus said to them, l tell you the truth. The Son cannot do anything alone. He sees what his Father is doing and he does the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>My Father loves his Son. He shows him all that he himself is doing. He will show his Son bigger works than these so that you may be surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>My Father raises people who were dead, and gives them life. So his Son gives life to anyone he wants to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>My Father judges no one, but he has made his Son to be the judge of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>He did this so that all people would respect the Son, just as they respect his Father. My Father has sent his Son. Anyone who does not respect his Son does not respect the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>I tell you the truth. The person who hears what I say and believes in him that sent me will live for ever. He will not be judged. He has already passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>I tell you the truth. The time is coming. Yes, the time is here when the dead people will hear the voice of the Son of God. Those who hear his voice will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>My Father has life in himself. And so he has made his Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>He has given his Son power also to judge because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not be surprised at what I say. The time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>They will come out of the graves. Those who have done what is good will come out to live. But those who have done what is wrong will come out to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I have no right to do anything myself. I judge the way I am told to judge. The way I judge people is right. I do not do what I myself want to do, but I do what my Father wants me to do. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I talk about myself, then what I say is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>But someone else also speaks about me. I know what he says about me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent someone to John and he has told you the truth about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>I do not need to listen to what a person says about me. But I tell you this so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>John was a light burning and shining. For a while you were happy to be in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have something greater than John to talk for me. It is the works that I do. My Father has given me works to finish. The works that I do tell that he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And my Father who sent me has himself talked about me. You have never heard him speak and you do not know what he is like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>The word he talks is not in your hearts, because you do not believe the one he sent to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You read holy writings carefully. You think that there you will find out how to live for ever. In the same writings you will read about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And yet you will not come to me for that life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not want people to call me great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know that you do not love God in your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Fathers name, but you will not receive me. If another person comes in his own name, then you will receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe? You are always calling each other great, but you do not want the only God to make you great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will carry a complaint against you to my Father. Moses has already carried the complaint against you. He is the very one you trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>If you really believed Moses, you would believe me too, because he wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>Then Jesus crossed over the sea of Galilee. (Another name for this sea was Tiberias.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>Many people followed him because they saw the big works he had done in healing the sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Jesus went up on a hill and sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>When Jesus looked up, he saw many people coming to him. He said to Philip, Where shall we buy food for these people to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>Jesus knew what he himself would do, but he said this to see what Philip would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, It would take nearly a years wages to buy enough food for them,  even if each one gets only a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of Jesus disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, talked to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>He said, A boy here has five loaves of bread and two small fish. But what can that little bit of food do for so many people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Tell the people to sit down. Much grass was there. The number of men who sat down was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the bread and thanked God for it. He gave it to the disciples and they divided it among those who were sitting. He did the same thing with the fish. The people had all they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they had eaten enough, he said to his disciples, Gather up all the pieces that are left so that nothing will be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They gathered all the pieces of the five loaves. Twelve baskets full were left over after all the people had eaten enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When those men saw the big work that Jesus did, they said, Truly, this is the Prophet that is to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>The people wanted to take Jesus by force to make him a king. When he saw this, he left again and went on the hill by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>In the evening his disciples went down to the lake &lt;FI&gt;called the sea of Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>They got in a boat and crossed over the sea toward the town of Capernaum. It was dark,  but Jesus had not come back to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>A strong wind was blowing. It made the water very rough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>They rowed the boat into the middle of the lake. Then they saw Jesus walking on the water. He came close to the boat. They were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But Jesus said to them, It is I. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were glad to take him into the boat. Then at once the boat reached the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The people who stayed back on the land had seen one boat only. They had seen the disciples get in it and go away without Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>But there were some other boats from Tiberias. It was near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had thanked God for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>The next day the people saw that Jesus and his disciples were not there. Then they went to Capernaum in boats to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they said, Teacher, when did you get here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. You do not want me because you saw the big works I did,  but you want me because you ate all the bread you wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not work for the food that spoils, but work for the food that will never spoil, the food that will give you life for ever. The Son of Man will give you that food. God my Father has chosen him to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They asked him, What works does God ask us to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered them, The work that God asks you to do is to believe in the one whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They said, What big work will you do? We want to see it and believe you. What work are you are going to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate bread in the wilderness. The holy writings say, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. It was not Moses who gave you that bread from heaven. But my Father gives you true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>He who comes down from heaven is the bread that God gives. He is the one who gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said to him, Lord, give us this bread always!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life. Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry.  Anyone who believes in me will never be thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me, and yet you will not believe in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All those whom my Father gives me, they will come to me. I will never turn anyone away who comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>I did not come down from heaven to do what I myself want to do. I came to do what the one who sent me wants me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>My Father sent me. He wants me to lose nothing that he has given me. And he wants me to raise it up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>My Father wants everyone who sees his Son and believes in him to live for ever. I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The leaders of the Jews did not like Jesus to say, I am the bread that has come down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They said, Is he not Josephs son, Jesus? We know his father and mother. How can he say, "I have come down from heaven"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered them, There is no need for you to talk against me to each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me if my Father does not draw him. He sent me. I myself will raise up the one who comes to me. I will bring him back to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>The prophets wrote, "God will teach all people." So then, every person who listens to his words and learns what he says, he will come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>But no person has seen my Father. The only one who has seen him is the one who comes from God. He has seen my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>I tell you the truth. The person who believes in me will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread that gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate bread in the desert long ago, but they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>Here is bread that comes down from heaven. The person who eats this bread will never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the bread that gives life. I came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live for ever. I will give bread so that the world may live. I am that bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The leaders of the Jews began to quarrel with each other about what Jesus said. They said, How can he give us himself to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If you do not eat the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you will not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood will live for ever. I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>I am real food, and my blood is real drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>Anyone who eats me and drinks my blood is in me and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>My Father is living. He sent me. I have my life from him. In the same way, the person who eats of me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This bread which came down from heaven is not like the bread that your fathers ate.  They ate bread but they died. Anyone who eats this bread from heaven will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>Jesus was in the meeting house in Capernaum when he was teaching people these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples heard it. They said, This is a hard teaching. Who can listen to it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus knew that his disciples did not like what he said. He asked, Is this hard for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What would you do if you saw the Son of Man go up to the place where he came from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that gives life. The flesh does not help. The words I say to you are Spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But even so, some of you do not believe me. Jesus knew right from the beginning which ones of them would not believe. He knew who was going to give him over to people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>Then Jesus said, That is why I said to you, "No one can come to me unless my Father lets him come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>After that, many of the followers of Jesus left him and stopped travelling around with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus said to the twelve disciples, Will you also leave me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go? It is you who has told us how we may live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>We believe now, and we know it is true. You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus said to them, Did I not choose you twelve? And one of you is a devil!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to give him over to people who hated him. Judas was one of these twelve disciples.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this, Jesus travelled around in Galilee. He would not travel around in Judea because the leaders of the Jews wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Every year the Jews had a feast to remember the time when their fathers lived in tents in the desert. The time was near for that feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>Jesus brothers said to him, Go away from here to Judea. Let your disciples also see the work you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>When a person wants people to know about him, he does not hide what he is doing. If you are doing these big things, let the world see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>Even his brothers did not believe in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus said to them, It is not yet the time for me to go. But you may go any time you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The people of the world cannot hate you. But they hate me because I say what they do is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go to the feast yourselves. I am not going to the feast until it is the right time for me to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>He said this to them and stayed in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>After his brothers went to the feast, Jesus went also. He did not go with the other people,  but he went by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The leaders of the Jews at the feast tried to find him. They said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>People were talking among themselves about Jesus. Some said, He is a good man.  Others said, No. He is leading people to do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>But they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, so no one talked about him out in the open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>When the feast was half finished, Jesus went to the temple and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews were very much surprised. How can this man know books? He never went to school.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered the people, I am not teaching you my teaching. It is the teaching of the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any man wants to do what God wants him to do, he will know the teaching. He will know if it is Gods teaching or if I am speaking from my own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The person who speaks from his own mind only wants to be great himself. But the person whom God has sent wants to show that God is great. That person is true. He is not a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Not one of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered Jesus, A bad spirit is in you! Who is trying to kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered them, I have done one thing. You are all surprised about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses gave you the law of circumcision. You obey the law, not because it came from Moses, but because it came from the fathers long ago. You circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>You do it on the Sabbath day so that you will not break the law of Moses. If you do that,  then why are you angry with me because I healed a man on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge by what you see, but judge in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Some people from Jerusalem said, Is not this the person they are trying to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>See, he does not fear to speak and yet they say nothing to him! Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>But we know where this man comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus was teaching in the temple. He spoke loudly saying, You know me and you know where I come from. I have not come in my own power. The one who sent me is true. He is the one you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him because I came from him. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then the people wanted to catch him. But no one put a hand on him. It was not yet the time for that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>Many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, When Christ comes, will he do greater works than this man has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard what the people said about him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers to catch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus said, I will stay with you a short time longer. Then I will go back to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will look for me, but you will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said to one another, Where will he go that we cannot find him? Will he go to our people who are living in other countries? Will he teach them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean by this: "You will look for me and will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>The last day of the feast was a big day. On that day Jesus stood up and shouted, If anyone is thirsty, he may come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>If anyone believes in me, the holy writings say, "Rivers of water that give life will flow out of his heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>This is what Jesus meant: those who believe in him would receive the Spirit. At that time no one had received the Holy Spirit because Jesus had not yet been lifted up to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>When some of the people heard this they said, Truly, this is the Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Other people said, This is the Christ. But some said, The Christ will not come from Galilee. Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Do not the holy writings say that Christ will be of Davids family? Will he not come from Bethlehem where David lived?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>The people did not all say the same thing about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them wanted to catch Jesus, but no one put hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The soldiers came back to the chief priests and the Pharisees. They asked the soldiers,  Why did you not bring him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The soldiers replied, No person has ever talked like he does!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees said, Has he fooled you also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>None of the rulers and none of the Pharisees have believed on him, have they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>These poor people do not know the law. They will die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, the man who came to Jesus by night, was one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>He said, Is it right to judge any man by our law before we hear him and learn what he has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered him, Are you from Galilee also? Study what is written. You will see that no prophet is to come from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then every one of them went home.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>Then Jesus went to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early the next morning he came again to the temple. All the people came to him. He sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman to Jesus. They had caught her having sex with a man who was not her husband. They made the woman stand in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>They said, Teacher, this woman has committed adultery. She was caught doing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>The law of Moses tells us that the people who do that should be killed with stones. What do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to see what Jesus would do, because they wanted to find something wrong with him. Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>They kept on asking him. He stood up and said to them, The one among you who has never done any wrong thing may throw the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And Jesus bent down again and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>When the people heard what he said, they went out, one by one. The oldest one went out first. Jesus was left alone with the woman in front of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus looked up and said to her, Woman, where are the people? Has no one judged you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, No one, Sir. Jesus said, I also do not judge you. Go, and do no wrong thing again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Then Jesus talked to the people in the temple. He said, I am the Light of the world. The one who comes with me will never walk in the dark, but he will have light that gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees said, You are talking about yourself. What you say is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus said to them, Even if I do talk about myself, what I say is true. I know where I come from and I know where I am going. But you do not know where I came from, or where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge in the way people judge matters. I do not judge any person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>But even if I do judge, I judge right. I am not alone. My Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>Even in your law it says that when two people say the same thing, it is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I talk about myself, and my Father who sent me talks about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>They asked him, Where is your Father? He said, You do not know me and you do not know my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>When Jesus said these words he was teaching in the temple. He was in the place where the money is kept. No one caught him because it was not yet his time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Jesus talked to them again. He said, I am going away. You will try to find me and will die doing wrong things. You cannot come where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? He says, "You cannot come where I am going."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>Jesus said to them, You are from below. I am from above. You belong to this world. I do not belong to this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>That is why I said, "You will die doing wrong things." If you do not believe that I am who I said I am, then you will die doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said to him, Who are you? Jesus answered, I am what I told you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say to you and to judge you in many things. But he who sent me is true. I tell the world what he has told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>The people did not understand that Jesus was talking to them about his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus said, When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he.  You will know that I do nothing by my own power, but I talk the way my Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>He who sent me is with me always. I always do what he wants me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>Many people believed in Jesus while he was talking this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, If you obey my word, you are truly my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you will understand the truth and the truth will make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They said to him, We are Abrahams children. We have always been free. Why do you say to us, "You will be free"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, I tell you the truth. People who do wrong things are not free.  They become a slave of the wrong things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>A slave does not belong to the family for ever. But a son belongs for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you come from Abraham. But you want to kill me because you do not like what I tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I tell you about the things that I have seen where my Father is, and you do what you have seen your father do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said, If you were Abrahams children, you would do what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But you want to kill me because I told you the truth which I learned from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You are doing your fathers work. Then they said to him, We were not born of an unmarried woman. God is the Father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love me, because I have come from God. I did not come by my own power. God sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand what I say? I will tell you why. It is because you do not want to understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>The bad spirit, the devil, is your real father. You gladly do the wrong things he wants you to do. From the beginning he killed people. He has nothing to do with what is true.  His way is to tell lies. He himself is a liar and all lying comes from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>You do not believe me because I tell you what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which one of you can prove that what I have done is bad? I tell you what is true. Why then do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>The person who comes from God listens to what God says. You do not come from God.  That is why you do not listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The leaders of the Jews answered him, We say what is true. We say that you come from Samaria. And we say that a bad spirit is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus said, I have no bad spirit in me. I respect my Father but you do not respect me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>I do not want to make myself great. There is one who makes me great. He judges the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>I tell you the truth. If anyone obeys my word, he will never die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The leaders of the Jews said to him, Now we know it is true that a bad spirit is in you.  Abraham died. So did the prophets. And yet you say, "If anyone obeys my word, he will never die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham and the prophets of God who died long ago?  Who do you make yourself out to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I make myself great, then I am not great. But my Father makes me great. You say he is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>But you do not know God. I know him. If I say, "I do not know him," I am a liar, just as you people are. But I know him and I obey his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham was glad that he would see my coming. He did see it and he was very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jewish leaders said to him, You are not fifty years old yet. How could Abraham see you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus answered, I tell you the truth. I already was before Abraham was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus got out of their way. He left the temple and they did not know where he went.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>On his way out of the temple Jesus saw a man who had been born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>His disciples asked Jesus, Master, was this man born blind because of the wrong things he did, or was it the wrong things his parents did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, It was not that he or his parents did any wrong thing. But it was so that people would see what God will do in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>There is one who has sent me. I must do his work while it is still daylight. Night is coming. Then it will be too dark to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>When Jesus had said this, he spat on the ground. Then he put some of the wet dirt on the mans eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And he said, Go. wash your eyes in that water hole called Siloam. (Siloam means Sent.)  The man went and washed his eyes. After that, he was able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>His neighbours and other people had seen him when he was blind. They said, Is not this the same man who used to sit here and beg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some people said, Yes, this is the same man. Others said, He is like that man. But the man himself said, I am that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They asked him, How is it that you can see now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered them, That man whose name is Jesus made some mud. He rubbed it on my eyes and told me to go and wash them in the water hole Siloam. And when I had washed my eyes, I could see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Where is the man? they asked. He said, I do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>The day Jesus made the mud and healed the man was the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then the Pharisees also asked the man, How is it that you can see now? He answered them, The man put mud on my eyes. I washed my eyes and now I can see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God. He does not obey the Sabbath day law. The others said, But how can a bad man do such a big work? So the Pharisees did not agree together in what they thought about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>Then they asked the man who had been born blind, What do you say about the man who healed you? He answered, I say he is a prophet from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the leaders of the Jews did not really believe what they heard about the man. They did not believe that first he had been blind and now was able to see. So they called the parents of the man who could now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>Tell us, they said. Is this your son who you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>The parents answered, We know that this is our son. And we know that he was born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>But we do not know how it is that he can now see. We do not know who healed him.  Ask him. He is old enough to talk for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>The parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. They knew that the leaders of the Jews had already agreed that if anyone said Jesus is the Christ, they would be put out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>That is why the parents said, He is old enough to talk for himself. Ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>Then again they called the man who had been blind. They said to him, You must praise God for this. We know that the man who healed you is a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He answered them, I do not know if he is a bad man or not. But one thing I do know. I know that first I was blind, but now I can see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he heal you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, I told you already. You did not listen. Why do you want me to tell you again? Do you also want to be his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>This made them angry. They said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God talked to Moses. But this man, we do not know where he comes from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man who had been blind said, This surprises me! He healed me and yet you do not know where he comes from!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God does not listen to bad people. But God listens to the person who shows him respect and who obeys him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Before this, no one has ever healed a man who was born blind. Such a thing has not been heard of since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man did not come from God, he could not do anything like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered, You have been a bad man ever since you were born! Now are you trying to teach us? And with that they put him out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that the people had put him out. When he found him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, Sir, who is the Son of God? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said, You have already seen him. The person who is talking to you now, he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>The man said, Sir, I do believe. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>Jesus said, I came into the world so that people may be judged. I came so that those who are blind may see. And I came so that those who see may become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some of the Pharisees were with Jesus and heard him say this. They asked him, You mean to say that we are blind also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus answered them, If you agreed that you were blind, you would not be bad people.  But you say, "We can see." So then you are still bad people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Then Jesus went on to say, I tell you the truth. A person must get to the sheep through the door. Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things. He has come to steal the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>But the man who comes in through the door, he is the one who takes care of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>The guard will open the door for him. The sheep will listen to him. He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>When all his own sheep are out of the house, he goes ahead of them. The sheep come behind him because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>They will not go after a stranger. They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>So Jesus told them again. He said, I tell you the truth. I am the door of the sheep house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All those who came before me are bad people and steal things. They came to steal the sheep. But the sheep did not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the door. Anyone who comes in through me will be saved. He will go in and out as he wants to, and will have food to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes only to steal the sheep and to kill them and spoil them. I have come so that people may live and that they may enjoy life to the full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>I am the good shepherd. I am the one who really cares for the sheep. The good shepherd is willing to die to save his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>Some people work for pay. The one who does that is not the one who really cares. The sheep do not belong to him. When he sees a bad animal coming, he will leave the sheep and run away. He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd, the one who really cares for the sheep. I know my sheep and my sheep know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>So my Father knows me and I know him. I am willing to die to save the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice. Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>My Father loves me because I am willing to die. But when I die, I will live again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one kills me. I die only because I choose to die. I have power to die and I have power to live again. This is what my Father has told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, A bad spirit is in him. He is crazy. Why do you listen to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>But others said, A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says. Can a bad spirit make blind people see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple. It was the cold time of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomons resting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>The Jews came around Jesus and said, How long will you keep us wondering about this matter? If you are really the Christ, then tell us plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Then Jesus said, I have already told you and you did not believe it. My Father has given me the power to do big works. These works tell you who I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep. I told you this before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep listen to me. I know them. They come to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>I give them life that lasts for ever. They will never die. No one will take them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father gave the sheep to me. He is greater than anyone else. No one is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>My Father and I are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>So Jesus said to them, I have done many good things that come from my Father. For which one of those are you going to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>Then the Jewish leaders answered him, We do not kill you for doing any good thing. But you do not respect God. You are only a man, and yet you say you are God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, In your own books it is written that God said, "You are gods."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>Nothing can change the words in the holy writings. It is written that God spoke to men and that he called them gods. So he called some men gods. Then why do you say I do not respect God when I say that I am the Son of God? I am the one God chose and sent into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I am not doing my Fathers work, then do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I am doing my Fathers work, believe the work that I do, even though you do not believe me. Then you will know and you will believe that my Father is in me and I am in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Because of what he said, they tried to catch Jesus again. But he got away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River. He went to the place where John &lt;FI&gt;the Baptizer&lt;Fi&gt; was when he first baptized people. Jesus stayed there for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Many people came to him there. They said, John himself did not do any big work. But everything that John said about this man is true.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, Lord, the one whom you love is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus heard the message. He said, The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>After that, he said to his disciples, Let us go back again to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>They said, Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>After he said this, he said also, Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, Let us all go and die with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said, Your brother will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said, I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said, I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out.  They went after her. They said, She is going to the grave to cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>Where have you buried him? he said. Come, Lord, and see, they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Then Jesus cried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Look, the Jews said. He truly loved him very much!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>Then some of them said, This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Take the stone away. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you because you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said this, he shouted, Lazarus, come out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, Take off the cloths and free him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, What are we going to do?  This man is doing many big works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, You know nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year.  God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the Passover Feast Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus lived. This was the Lazarus that Jesus had raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>The people made supper for Jesus. Martha helped give food for the people, and Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary had a jar of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put some of it on Jesus feet. Then she wiped his feet with her hair. The smell of oil went all through the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, was there. He was one of the disciples, the one who was going to give Jesus over to the people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>He said, This oil is worth a years wages! Why did we not sell it and give the money to poor people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Judas did not say this because he cared for poor people. But he used to steal. He carried the disciples money bag and he used to take money out of the bag for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Leave her alone. She has kept this oil for the time when they will bury me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>You will have poor people with you always. But you will not always have me with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Many of the Jews knew that Jesus was at Bethany. So they came because Jesus was there. But they also came to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>Many of the Jews left the priests and believed in Jesus, because of Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day Jesus went to Jerusalem. Many people who were at the feast heard that he was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>So they took branches of palm trees and went to meet him. They shouted, Praise God!  God bless the King of Israel! He is coming in the name of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Then Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it. He did as the holy writings say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Do not fear, people of Jerusalem. Your King is coming. He will be riding on a young donkey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand this at first. But when God had made Jesus great, then they remembered what the holy writings said about him. They remembered that people had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Many people were with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from death. They had talked about what he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>That is why many people went out to meet Jesus. They had heard about the big work he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees said to each other, See, you cannot stop this thing. People everywhere are going after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Some of the people who came to worship God at the feast were Greek people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, Sir, we want to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came to Andrew and told him. Then they both went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus said, The time has come when the Son of Man will be made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>I tell you the truth. If a seed of grain is not put in the ground to die, it will be only a seed.  But if it dies, it will bear many seeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. Anyone who gives up his life in this world will live for ever in the next world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone wants to do my work, he must go where I go. Then he and I will be together.  My Father will honour everyone who works for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now my heart is very sad. Shall I say, "Father, save me from this time of trouble"? No, I have come to this time just so that I might go through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, do what will make your name great. Then a voice from the sky said, I have already done that and I will do it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Some people were standing near. When they heard the voice, they said, It is thundering.  Other people said, An angel talked to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered them, This voice did not come for my sake, but it came for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>It is time now for the world to be judged. The ruler of this world will be put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And as for me, if they lift me up from the earth, I will draw all people to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to show how he would die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered him, Our law book tells us that Christ will stay here for ever. Why do you say, "The Son of Man will be raised up from the earth"? Tell us who this Son of Man is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, You have light for a short time longer. Walk while you have the light so that you will not need to walk in the dark. The person who walks in the dark cannot see where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may be a people who have the light in you. When Jesus had said this, he left them. They did not know where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Even though they had seen Jesus doing many big works, they did not believe in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>So they could not believe. Isaiah said also, God has made them blind. Their hearts have no feeling. They cannot see. They do not understand with their heart. They will not turn to God. If they did turn, he would heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this about the Christ when he saw how great he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Some of the chief rulers believed in Jesus, but they did not tell anyone that they believed in him. They were afraid the Pharisees would put them out of the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>They wanted the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus called out, Anyone who believes in me does not believe just in me, but in the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>Anyone who sees me sees the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am a light and have come into the world. Anyone who believes in me will not be in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If anyone hears what I say and does not believe it, I do not judge him. I did not come to judge the world. I came to save the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>I have not said this from my own mind, but my Father who sent me told me what to say.  He told me what to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>I know that what he told me to say has power to give life for ever. So I say everything my Father has told me to say.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Before the Passover Feast had started, Jesus saw that the time had come for him to leave this world. The time had come for him to go back to his Father. He loved his own people who were in the world. And he loved them the same way right to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>He and his disciples were eating together. The devil had already put it into Judas heart to give Jesus over to people who hated him. (Judas was the son of Simon Iscariot.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>My children, I am with you for a short time longer. You will look for me. What I said to the Jews I say to you now: "You cannot come to the place where I am going."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>I give you a new law. That law is, "Love each other." As I have loved you, so you also love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>This is how all people will know that you are my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where are you going? Jesus answered him, You cannot go with me where I am going now. Later on you will go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>Peter said to him, Lord, why can I not go with you now? I am willing to die for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>Jesus answered him, Will you die for me? I tell you the truth. Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.1'>Jesus said, Do not let anything trouble your heart. You believe in God and you must believe in me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.2'>In my Fathers house are many rooms. If it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to make a place ready for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.3'>If I go to make a place ready for you, I will come again. I will come to take you so that you may be with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.4'>You know where I am going, and you know the way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.6'>Jesus said to him, I am the way. I am the truth. I give life. No one can come to my Father unless I take him there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.9'>Jesus said to him, Philip, you mean to say that I have been with you all this time and yet you do not know me? The person who has seen me has seen my Father also. Why do you say, "Show us your Father"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.10'>Do you not believe that I am in my Father and my Father is in me? The things that I say, I speak not from my own mind. But my Father lives in me and he does the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.11'>I tell you that I am in my Father and my Father is in me. But you do not believe me. So then let the work that I do prove it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.12'>I tell you the truth. The person who believes in me will do the big work that I do. And he will do even bigger work because I go to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.13'>I will do anything you ask of my Father in my name. In that way the Son will make my Fathers name great.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.17'>He will send you the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive the true Spirit because it does not see or know him. You know him because he is with you and will be in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.19'>In a short time the world will not see me again, but you will see me again. Because I live,  you will live also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.20'>At that time you will know that I am in my Father. You are in me, and I am in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.21'>He who knows the things I tell him to do and does them, really loves me. My Father will love him and I also will love him. I will show him who I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.14.23'>Jesus said to him, If a person loves me, he will obey me. My Father also will love him.  And we will come to him and will live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.24'>The person who does not love me does not obey me. The word which you hear is not my word. It is my Fathers word. He is the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.25'>I have told you these things while I am still with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.26'>But the Holy Spirit is the one who will help you. My Father will send him in my name.  He will teach you everything that I have said to you. His Helper will remind you of all that I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.27'>Peace is what I leave for you. I give you my own peace. People of the world also say,  "Peace" to you. I do not say it as they say it. Do not let anything trouble your hearts. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.28'>You heard me say, "I am going away and then I will come back to you." If you really loved me, then you would have been very glad that I am going to my Father. My Father is greater than I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.29'>I have told you this before it happens. Then when it does happen, you will believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.30'>After this I will not talk much with you. The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.14.31'>I will do what my Father tells me to do so that the people of the world may know that I love my Father. Get up now! We must go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.4'>But you must be in me and I will be in you. The branch cannot bear fruit by itself. It must be joined to the tree. And you cannot do any good thing if you are not joined to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.5'>I am the fruit tree and you are the branches. I will be in the person who is in me. That person will have a fruitful life. But you can do nothing without me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.6'>If any person is not in me, he is cut off like a branch and dies. People gather the dry branches and throw them into the fire to be burned.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.16'>You did not choose me, but I chose you. I gave you a big work to do. That work is to go out and do good things and to make the good things that you do remain strong. If you do that, my Father will do anything you ask in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.15.17'>Here is the law I gave you. Love each other.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.15.22'>I came and spoke to them. If I had not done that, then what they did would not have been a wrong thing. But now they have no excuse for doing it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.16.2'>The people will put you out of the meeting place. Yes, the time is coming when someone will kill you and think he is working for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.3'>They will do these things because they do not know my Father nor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.4'>I have told you all these things now. Then when that time comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things in the beginning because I myself was with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.5'>But now I am going back to him who sent me here. Yet not one of you is asking me,  "Where are you going?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.6'>Your hearts are very sad because I have told you these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.7'>Anyway, I am telling you the truth. It is better for you if I go away. If I do not go away,  the one who is to help you will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.8'>When the Helper comes, he will prove this to the people of the world that they are wrong. They are wrong about what they call bad and about what they call good. He will show them how to be right with God. He will show them about Gods judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.9'>He will prove it is a bad thing that they do not believe in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.10'>He will show what really is right, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.11'>He will show them how to judge right, because the ruler of this world himself will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.12'>I have many other things to tell you, but you cannot understand them now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.13'>When the truth-giving Spirit comes, he will show you everything that is true. He will not speak his own message, but he will tell you the things that he has been told to tell you. He will tell you what is going to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.14'>He will make my name great. He will take what is mine and tell it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.15'>Everything that belongs to my Father belongs to me also. That is why I said, "He will take what is mine and tell it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.16'>Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me again,  because I go to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.17'>Some of the disciples talked among themselves and said, He says, "Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me." And he says, "Because I go to my Father." What does he mean by "a little while"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.18'>We do not know what he means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.19'>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him this question. So he said to them, Are you asking each other what I mean by saying, "Very soon you will not see me. Then in a little while after that you will see me"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.20'>I tell you the truth. You people will cry and be very sad, but the people in the world will be very glad. At first you will be sad, but after that you will not be sad. You will be glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.21'>Any woman is sad just before her baby is born. She has much pain because the time has come for the baby to be born. But as soon as the baby is born, she forgets the pain she had. She is very glad because a person has been born into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.22'>So you also are very sad now. But I will see you again. Then you will be very glad. And no one can take your joy from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.23'>When that time comes, you will not ask me for anything. I tell you the truth. My Father will do for you anything you ask in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.24'>You have not asked for anything in my name yet. Ask my Father and he will give it to you. That is what will make you very glad always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.25'>I have told you these things by a story. The time will come when I will not talk by stories. I will tell you about my Father plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.26'>When that day comes, you will ask in my name. I do not say that I will ask my Father for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.27'>My Father himself loves you. He loves you because you have loved me. And he loves you because you have believed that God sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.28'>My Father sent me into the world. And now I will leave the world and go back to my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.29'>The disciples said to him, Yes, now you are telling us plainly. You are not telling us with words we do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.30'>We know now that you know everything. No one needs to ask you questions. This makes us believe that God sent you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.31'>Jesus answered them, Do you really believe now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.32'>Listen, the time is coming. No, the time is here when you will run away. Every man will go to his own home. You will leave me on my own. And yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.16.33'>I have told you these things so that you may have peace. I give you peace. The world will trouble you much. But be glad. I have power over the world.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.18'>
        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had finished saying this, he and his disciples went through the valley called Kidron. There was a garden with trees. He and his disciples went into the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Jesus had gone to this place often with his disciples, so Judas knew where the place was.  He was the one who gave Jesus over to the people who hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers and guards with Judas. They had lamps,  and torches, and things to fight with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. So he went out and said to them,  Who are you looking for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered, Jesus from Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. Judas, who had given Jesus over to them, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When Jesus said to them, I am he, they all drew back suddenly and fell down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>So Jesus asked them again, Who are you looking for? And they said, Jesus from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Then Jesus answered, I have already told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>So his words came true. He had said, I did not lose one of those you gave me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter had a long knife or sword. He took it out and hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword back in its place. Must I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the soldiers, and the captain, and the guards caught Jesus and tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>First they took him to Annas. He was the father of Caiaphas wife. Caiaphas was the high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>This was the same Caiaphas that had talked to the leaders of the Jews. He had said, It is better for one man to die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Simon Peter and one other disciple went after Jesus. The other disciple knew the high priest, so he went right in with Jesus through the gate of the high priests large house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood by the gate outside. The other disciple who knew the high priest talked to the servant at the door and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>The servant at the door said to Peter, Are you one of this mans disciples too? Peter said,  No, I am not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>It was cold there. The servants and the officers had made a small fire. They stood by it and warmed themselves. Peter stood by the fire also and warmed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, I have talked so that anyone who wanted to could hear me. I have always taught in the meeting houses and in the temple. That is where the Jews always go.  I have not said anything in a secret way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you ask me? The people heard me talk. Ask them what I told them. They know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had said this, one of the officers who stood there hit Jesus. He said, Is that the way you answer the high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, If I have said anything bad, tell me plainly what wrong thing I have said. If I have told the truth, why do you hit me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Jesus was still tied up. Annas sent him over to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Simon Peter stayed by the fire and stood warming himself. So the people said to him,  Are you not one of his disciples also? He said, No, I am not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>A servant was there. He was of the same family as the one whose ear Peter had cut off.  He said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Again Peter said, No! And just then a cock called out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the court house. It was early in the day. They themselves did not go into the court house. They did not want to become unclean. They wanted to eat the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate went out to the Jewish leaders and said, What complaint do you bring against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They said to him, If he were not a very bad man, then we would not have brought him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate said, Take him and judge him by your own law. The leaders of the Jews said,  But we are not allowed to kill anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>So this is the way the words of Jesus came true. He had said how he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate went back into the court house again. He called for Jesus and asked him,  Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do you ask me because you yourself think I am, or do you ask me because others said I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests have brought you here to me. Tell me, what have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered him, I am not a king in this world. If I were, my people would fight so that I would not be given to the Jews. But I am not a king in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>So Pilate said, So you really are a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. The reason that I was born was that I should tell what is true. That is why I came into the world. Everyone who likes what is true listens to what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said, What is truth? When he had said this, he went out to the Jews again. He told them, I find nothing wrong in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But at the Passover Feast you always want me to let one prisoner go free for you. Do you want me to let the King of the Jews go free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all shouted again, Not this man, but Barabbas! Barabbas was a man who had stolen things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Pilate took Jesus and had him beaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>The soldiers made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on Jesus head. They put a red gown on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>They said, Greetings, King of the Jews! They beat him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Then Pilate went out to the people again and said to them, See, I bring the man before you. This is to show you that I find nothing wrong in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Then Jesus came out. He had the crown of thorns on his head and had the red gown on him. Pilate said, Here is the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, You take him and nail him to a cross. I find nothing wrong in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The leaders of the Jews answered him, We have a law. That law says he should die,  because he calls himself the Son of God. When Pilate heard what they said, he was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>He went into the court house again and said to Jesus, Where do you come from? But Jesus did not answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said, Do you not answer me? Do you not know that I have power to nail you to a cross, or to let you go free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus said, You would have no power over me if God did not give you power. So then,  the man who gave me up to you has done something worse than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>After that Pilate tried to let Jesus go free. But the Jews shouted, If you let this man free,  you are not Caesars friend! Anyone who makes himself a king is fighting against Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out. Then Pilate sat on the bench where the judge sits. The place was called the Street of Stone. The Jews called it Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>It was about the middle of the day before the Passover Feast. Pilate said to the Jews,  See, here is your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they shouted, Take him away! Take him away! Nail him to a cross! Pilate said to them, Shall I nail your King to a cross? The chief priests answered, Caesar is the only king we have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then Pilate gave them Jesus to be nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>They took Jesus and led him away. Jesus went out carrying his own cross. They went to a place which the Jews called Golgotha. That means the place of the skull bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they nailed Jesus to the cross. Two other people were also nailed to crosses. One was put on each side of Jesus. Jesus was put in the centre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. He wrote, Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this sign. The place where Jesus was nailed to a cross was near the city. The sign was written in the Jewish, Greek, and Latin languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Then the chief priests among the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, "The King of the Jews," but write, "This man said he is King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his clothes. They divided them into four parts and gave each soldier one part. Then they took his coat. It was not sewn together but the cloth was all made in one piece from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So the soldiers said to one another, We will not tear this. But let us gamble for it. What the holy writings say came true. They say, They divided my clothes among them. They gambled for my coat. That is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas,  and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near. He said to his mother, Woman, see your son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>And he said to the disciple, See your mother! From that time on, that disciple took her to live in his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>Jesus now knew that everything had happened that the holy writings said. He said, I am thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A bowl of bad wine was there. They took something called a sponge and made it wet with the wine. Then they put it on a stick and put it to Jesus mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Jesus took the wine. Then he said, It is finished. And he bowed his head and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>It was the day before the Sabbath day. The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day because it was a big day. So they begged Pilate to break the legs of those who had been nailed to crosses. Then they could be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers came and broke the legs of the one nailed to the cross on one side of Jesus.  Then they broke the legs of the one on the other side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. So they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>One of the soldiers stuck a spear into the side of Jesus body. Right away, blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>The man who saw it told what he saw, so that you may believe. What he said is true and he knows that it is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>What the holy writings say came true. They say, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>They also say, They shall look at the one into whom they stuck the spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>A man named Joseph, from the town of Arimathea, was a disciple of Jesus. But he did not say so because he was afraid of the leaders of the Jews. After all this had happened,  he went to Pilate. He asked him to let him take Jesus body away. Pilate let him. So he came and took his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus also came. He was the one who had come to Jesus at night. He brought with him a heavy bag of sweet-smelling spices called myrrh and aloes. It was mixed together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They wrapped linen cloth around the body of Jesus and put the myrrh and aloes in with the cloth. That is how Jews bury a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>There was a garden at the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross. In the garden was a new grave cut in the rock. No one had ever been laid in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>They laid Jesus body there because it was the day before the Sabbath day, and the grave was near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Mary Magdalene came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was early in the morning and not very light. She saw that the stone had been taken away from the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran and met Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved. She said to them, They have taken the Lord out of the grave! We do not know where they have laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Then Peter and that other disciple also went to the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>Both of them ran. The other disciple ran faster than Peter and got to the grave first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>He bent down and looked in. He saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came up behind him. He went into the grave and saw the linen cloths lying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>He also saw the small cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus head. It was not with the other cloths, but it was folded together by itself in another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who got there first, also went in. He saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>Until this time they did not understand the holy writings where it says, He must rise from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside the grave crying. As she cried, she bent down and looked into the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>She saw two angels with white clothes on. They were sitting where Jesus body had been.  One sat at the head and one at the foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, Woman, why are you crying? She said to them, They have taken away my Lord and I do not know where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had said this, she turned around. She saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for? She thought he was the man who took care of the garden. So she said to him, Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him. I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned around again and said, Master!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Do not hold me, because I have not yet gone up to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them that I am going up to my Father. He is your Father also. I am going up to my God. He is your God also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples. She said, I have seen the Lord! And she told them what he had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>It was the first day of the week. In the evening the disciples were in a house together.  The doors were shut because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said to them again, Peace to you! My Father sent me: now I am sending you in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whoever you make free from the wrong things they have done will be free. Whoever you do not make free from the wrong things they have done will not be free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, was called the Twin. He was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples told him about it. They said, We have seen the Lord! Thomas said, I will not believe unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands. I will not believe unless I put my finger on the mark and feel his side with my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Then eight days later his disciples were in the house again. This time Thomas was with them. The doors were shut. Then Jesus came and stood there with them. He said to them, Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here. Look at my hands. Feel my side with your hand. Do not doubt anymore, but believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, You yourself have seen me. Is that why you now believe? God will bless people who believe though they have not seen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Jesus did many other big works when he was with the disciples. They are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. And when you believe in his name, then he will give you power to live.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>The next time the disciples saw Jesus was at the Sea of Tiberias &lt;FI&gt;Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; . This is how Jesus showed himself to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Some of the disciples were in one place. They were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to the others, I am going fishing. The others said, We are going with you also. They went out in a boat right away. That night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Early in the morning, Jesus was standing there by the sea. The disciples did not know it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>He said to them, My children, did you catch any fish? They answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He said to them, Throw out your net on the right side of the boat, then you will catch some. They threw out their net and caught many fish, so that they were not able to bring in the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! As soon as Simon Peter heard it was the Lord, he put on his coat and his belt. He had taken off some clothes to work. Then he jumped into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>The other disciples came in a small boat. They were pulling the net. It was full of fish.  They were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they came to the land, they saw a small fire. Fish and some bread lay on the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went to the boat. He pulled the net to land. It was full of big fish. There were a hundred and fifty three fish. But even with so many fish the net did not break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come and eat. The disciples were all afraid to ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came. He took bread and gave it to them. Then he took fish and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these? He said, Yes, Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He asked him the second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter said, Yes,  Lord. You know that I like you. I am your friend. Jesus said to him, Take care of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>Then he asked Peter the third time, Simon son of John, do you like me? Peter was sad because of the way Jesus asked him the third time. So he answered him, Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you as a close friend Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>I tell you the truth. When you were young, you put on your own belt. You went where you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will put out your hands. Others will put your belt on for you. They will take you where you do not want to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Jesus said this to show how Peter would die and make Gods name great. When he had finished saying this, he said to him, Come and follow me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned around. The disciple whom Jesus loved was coming with Jesus also. He was the one who was at Jesus right side at the supper table. He had said to Jesus, Lord, who will give you over to people who hate you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you? I want you to come and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So the report went around among the brothers that that disciple would not die. Jesus had not said to him, You will not die. But he had said, If I want him to wait till I come, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>The same disciple said these things and wrote them. We know what he said is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Jesus did many other things also. If every one were written down, I think that the world would be too small to hold all the books that would need to be written. Yes, it is so!</verse>
