        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>I am Paul. I am in prison because I belong to Christ Jesus. Our brother Timothy and I send greetings to you, Philemon. We love you very much. And you work with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>We also send greetings to our sister Apphia; to Archippus who is worker in Gods army as we are; and to the people who meet as a church in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in their kindness and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I always thank my God when I talk to him about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>I have heard that you love all of Gods people and that you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>You believe as I do. I ask God that he may help you to know more and more of every good thing that we have in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>My brother, your love made me very glad and it comforted my heart. I know that Gods people were glad because you loved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Because I am Christs apostle, I could tell you what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>But because I love you, I would rather not tell you, but ask you to do this for me. I, Paul,  am an old man and now I am in prison because I belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I am asking you to do something for my son. He became a Christian here in prison. This son is Onesimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>At one time he was no help to you. But now he is a big help to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back to you and it is like sending you my own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I would like to keep him with me. He can help me while I am in prison for the sake of the good news. That would be just as if you were here to help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But I did not want to do anything unless you agreed. I did not want you to do this because you were forced to do it, but because you wanted to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Maybe it was good for him to be away from you for a while. Now you will have him with you for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Now he is not like a slave who must work for you. He is better than a slave. He is a Christian brother and you will love him. I love him very much. But you will love him even more because he belongs to you and he is a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>So if you think of me as a real friend, take him back just as you would take me back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has done you any wrong, or if he owes you a debt, then ask me to pay it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it. I do not need to tell you that you have your life because of what I did for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, my brother, give me some help in the Lord. Make me happy in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>I believe that you will do what I ask you to do. And so I am writing to you. I know that you will do even more than I ask you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time, please make a place ready for me to stay. I know you are asking God to set me free, so I believe he will let me come to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras is in prison with me for the sake of Christ Jesus. He sends greetings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke are working with me. They all send greetings too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>May the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen! May it be so!</verse>
