        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Matt'>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>Here are the names of the people in the family line from which Jesus Christ came. He came from Davids family. He came from Abrahams family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Jesus family line: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Perez (his mother was Tamar), Zezron,  Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz (his mother was Rahab), Obed (his mother was Ruth), Jesse, David the king, Solomon (whose mother was Uriahs wife), Rehoboam,  Abijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joram, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon,  Josiah, Jeconiah and his brothers (at the time the people of Israel were carried away to Babylon), Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Abiud, Eliakim, Azor, Zadok, Achim, Eliud, Eleazor,  Matthan, Jacob and Joseph who was the husband of Mary. Mary was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>There were fourteen families from Abraham to David. There were fourteen families from David to the time the people were taken to Babylon. And there were fourteen families after that until Christ was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>This is the way Jesus Christ was born. Mary, his mother, was promised to Joseph to be his wife. But before they were married, she found out that she was going to have a baby.  It was by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph, the man she was to marry, was a good man. He did not want her to be made ashamed. So he planned to leave her without telling people about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>While he was thinking about this, he had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him. He said, Joseph, Davids son, do not fear to take Mary to be your wife. Her baby is by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She will have a baby son. Name him Jesus, because he will save his people from the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All of this had been told long before by the Lord through his prophet. It came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>The prophet said, A young woman who has not slept with a man is going to have a baby son. His name will be Emmanuel. That means "God is with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do. He took Mary to be his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>But he did not make love with her until her first son had been born. He named him Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in the country of Judea. Herod was the king.  After Jesus was born, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>They asked, Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled. All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting. He asked them,  Where is the Christ to be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They told him, In Bethlehem in Judea. That is what the prophet, the man of God long ago, wrote:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>"Bethlehem in the country of Judah, you are not the least among the leaders in Judah. A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly. He found out from them what time they saw the star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, Go and ask everywhere until you find the child.  When you have found him, come and tell me, so that I myself may go and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After they heard what the king said, they went away. And the star, which they had seen rising, went in front of them. It stopped above the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they were very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>They went into the house, and there they saw the child and Mary his mother. They kneeled down and worshipped him. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts.  These gifts were gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod. So they went home by a different road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him and said, Get up. Take the child and his mother, and go quickly to the country of Egypt. Stay there till I tell you, because Herod will try to find the child and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord told through his prophet long ago, came true. He said I called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him. He was very angry. He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it. They killed all the boys who were two years old or less. Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>So what the prophet Jeremiah said, came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>He said, A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah. Rachel was crying for her children. She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Herod died. Then Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>The angel said, Get up. Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel.  The men who wanted to kill the child are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herods place. So he was afraid to go there. In a dream he was told what to do. He went to the country of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth. The prophets of God long ago had said, He shall be called a man from Nazareth. What they said came true.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>After some years had passed, John the Baptizer came and told Gods word in the desert of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>He said, Stop doing wrong things and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is almost here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>This is the man that Isaiah the prophet of God spoke about long ago. He said, A man is calling in the wilderness, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>People went to him from Jerusalem, from all of Judea, and from all the country near the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>He baptised them in the Jordan River when they said how sorry they were for the wrong things they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>Many of the Pharisee group and the Sadducee group came to him to be baptised. But when he saw them, he said to them, You family of snakes! Who told you to run away from Gods anger that is coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Stop your wrong ways to show that you have turned back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Do not think you can say to your-selves, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God can make children for Abraham from these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>The axe is ready to cut down the trees. Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptise you with water when you stop your wrong ways. But another person is coming after me. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to take off his shoes. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He came to John to be baptised by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>John tried to stop him. He said, I need to be baptised by you. Why do you come to me to be baptised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered, Please do it now. In this way we shall do all that is right. Then John let him be baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>After Jesus was baptised, he came up out of the water right away. The sky opened. He saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>A voice from the sky said, This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert. The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights. Then he was very hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him, If you are Gods Son,  tell these stones to be changed into bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only. He needs to live by every word that God says."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He put him on a high part of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down. The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>The devil took Jesus to a very high hill. He showed him all the countries of the world and how great they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>He said to Jesus, I will give you all these if you kneel down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>But Jesus answered him, Get away, Satan. The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God. and he is the only one you are to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Jesus heard that John was put in prison, so he went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum. It is by the sea (of Galilee) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>So what the prophet Isaiah said came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>He talked about, The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali, the road by the sea, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, Galilee where the people are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>And he said, The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light. Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From then on, Jesus began to tell Gods word to the people. He said, Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is here!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon who later was named Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I will give you will be to catch people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers, James and John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in the boat with their father mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>Jesus called them. Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus went all around through Galilee. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>The people in all the country of Syria heard about him. They brought all who were sick in any way, or had bad spirits in them, and those who could not walk or use their hands.  Jesus healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Many people went with him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea,  and from the other side of the Jordan river.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>When Jesus saw the many people, he went up on a hill. He sat down and his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>He began to teach the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>He said, God makes happy those who know that they need him. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>God makes happy those who are sad. They will have comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>God makes happy those who quietly trust him and do not try to get their own way. The world will belong to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>God makes happy those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right and good. They will be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>God makes happy those who are kind. He will be kind to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>God makes happy those who have clean hearts. They will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>God makes happy those who make peace between people. They will be called Gods sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>God makes happy those who have trouble for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven is for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>God makes you happy when people say wrong things about you, when they trouble you,  and when they say all kinds of lies about you. God makes you happy when it is for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Be happy and glad because God will be good to you in heaven. In the same way people troubled the prophets before your time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are like salt in the world. If salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again?  Salt that has no taste is good for nothing. The only thing to do is to throw it out on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are like light in the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>So also with a lamp. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. But they put it on the place for a lamp. Then all the people in the house can see its light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So, let your light shine to all people. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Do not think that I have come to take away the law and the writings of the prophets. No,  I have not come to take them away. But I have come to do what they say must be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>I tell you the truth. Until the sky and the earth are taken away, not one small part of the law will be taken away, until everything has been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>So anyone who does not obey one of the smallest laws, and teaches other people not to obey it, will have the smallest part in the kingdom of heaven. But any one who obeys and teaches the law, will have a big part in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>I tell you, you must do much better than the scribes and Pharisees. If you do not, then you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard this said to men long ago, "Do not kill. Anyone who kills will be judged in court."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I tell you this. Anyone who is angry with his brother without having a good reason,  will be judged in court. Anyone who says wrong things to his brother will be judged for it in the big court. Anyone who says "You fool!" will be judged to go into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Perhaps you are bringing your gift to God at his altar. There you remember that your brother has something against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>If so, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First, go to your brother and make things right with him. Then come and give your gift to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way.  If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>I tell you the truth, you will not get out of prison until you have paid every piece of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that the law says, "Do not commit adultery &lt;FI&gt;have another man or woman who is not your husband or wife&lt;Fi&gt; ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I tell you that if a man looks at a woman and he wants her, then he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye makes you do wrong, take it out and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>If your right hand makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>The law said, "Any man who does not want to keep his wife must give her a paper to tell others she is no longer his wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I tell you, no man may send away his wife unless she has committed adultery. If he does send her away, he is making her commit adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away from her husband, he commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Also you have heard this said to men long ago, "You must not make a promise in Gods name and break it." And, "You must do for the Lord what you said you would do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I tell you, do not make a promise in Gods name. Do not use the name of heaven,  because that is where God rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Do not use the name of earth, because that is where God rests his feet. Do not use the name of Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Do not make a promise by your head, because you cannot make one hair of your head white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>You must mean "Yes" when you say "Yes". You must mean "No" when you say "No".  To say anything more than that is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that the law says, "Take an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you, do not fight with anyone who does wrong to you. But if someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>If anyone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>If anyone wants you to help carry a load, go with him twice as far.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>When someone asks you for something, give it to him. When someone wants to borrow something from you, let him have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that the law says, "Love your neighbour and hate your enemy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I tell you, love your enemies. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>In that way you will be sons of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun shine on both wrong and good people. He lets the rain fall on people who do right and on people who do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>Do you speak to your brothers only? If so, you are not doing any better than other people. Even people who do not believe in God do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>You must be good in every way, as your Father in heaven is good in every way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Do not do good things so that people will see you do them. If you do, you will get no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>So when you give money to poor people, do not send men in front of you to blow trumpets or horns. Some people do this in the meeting houses and on the streets so that people will praise them. They are not true to themselves. I tell you the truth. They have their pay already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you give money to poor people, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>In this way, what you give to the poor will be secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>When you talk to God, do not be like people who are not true to themselves. They like to stand and talk to God in the meeting houses and at the street corners, so that people will see them. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But when you talk to God, go into your room and shut the door. Then talk to your Father in secret. Your Father sees secret things and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when you talk to God, do not say words that mean nothing, over and over again.  People who do not believe in God do that. They think their god will hear them because they say many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>So talk to your God like this: "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>"May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>"Give us our food for today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>"Forgive us for the wrong things we have done, the way we forgive those who have done wrong things to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>"Do not test us but help us, so that no one will make us do wrong. Deliver us from the evil one. The kingdom and power and praise belong to you for ever. Amen!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>If you forgive others for the wrong things they have done, then your Father in heaven will forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you for the wrong things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>When you are fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; , do not look sad. That is what people do who are not true to themselves. They look sad to show people they are fasting. I tell you the truth. They have their reward already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face as you do at other times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>Then people will not see that you are fasting. But your Father sees secret things, and he will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Do not keep many things for yourself on earth. Insects and rust will spoil them. People will get in and steal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But keep things for yourself in heaven. Insects and rust will not spoil them there. People will not get in and steal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>The place where you keep things is where your heart will be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The body gets its light through the eyes. If you have good eyes, all your body will have light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eyes are bad, all your body will be in darkness. If the light in you is dark, it will be very dark for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No man can work for two masters. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will obey one and despise the other. You cannot work for both God and money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>So, I tell you this. Do not be troubled about what you will eat or drink to keep alive. Do not be troubled about what you will wear on your body. Life itself is worth more than food, and the body is worth more than clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look at the birds that fly in the air. They do not plant or cut or keep any food. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not worth more than birds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Can any one of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you troubled about clothes? See how the flowers grow in the fields. They do not work or make cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is put on the fire. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>So then, do not keep asking, "What shall we eat?" "What shall we drink?" and "What shall we wear?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>It is the people who do not believe in God who work for all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>Work first for Gods kingdom and what he calls good. Then you will have all these things also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>So do not be troubling yourself about tomorrow. Tomorrow will have its own trouble.  Todays trouble is enough for today.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>Why do you look at the spot of dust in your brothers eye? But you do not see a big stick in your own eye!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>You are not true to yourselves! First take the stick out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>Do not give what is holy to dogs. Do not throw your fine stones to pigs. They will walk all over them, and then turn and hurt you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>You are wrong, and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  your Father in heaven will give good things to those who ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>Do to other people what you want them to do to you. That is what the law and the writings of the prophets say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>Go in by the small gate. The gate is big and the road is wide that goes to death. Many people go that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>The gate is small and the road is not wide that goes to life. Not many people find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Take care. There are prophets who are not true. They come to you dressed like sheep,  but inside they are like wolves, bad animals that kill sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You will know them by the things they do. People do not pick fruit like grapes from thistles. They do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>In the same way, every good tree has good fruit. But a bad tree has bad fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree cannot have bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot have good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>Then I will say to them, "I never knew you. Go away from me! What you do is very wrong!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>When Jesus came down from the hill, many people followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>A man who had leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; came and kneeled in front of Jesus and worshipped him. He said to Jesus, Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>Jesus put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to. Be healed. Right away his leprosy was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Jesus said to him, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.  Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it, to prove to people you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>When Jesus came to the town of Capernaum, a Roman army officer came to ask him for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>He said, Sir, one of my servants is in bed at my house. He cannot move and has much pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus said, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The officer said, Sir, I am not good enough to have you come into my house. Just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>I myself am a man who takes orders, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>Jesus was surprised when he heard this. He said to the people who followed him, I tell you the truth. I have not found any Jew who believes as this man does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>I tell you, many people will come from the east and from the west. They will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But those who were born in the kingdom will be put into the darkness outside. There they will cry and make noises with their teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Jesus said to the officer, Go home. What you have believed, will be done. At that very same time the officers servant was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Jesus went into Peters house. There he saw the mother of Peters wife in bed, sick with fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>Jesus took hold of her hand and the fever left her. She got up and began to do things for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>That evening, many people who had bad spirits were brought to Jesus. He spoke to the bad spirits and drove them out. And he healed all the people who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>What the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said, He took away the things that made us weak. He took away the things that made us sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Jesus saw many people around him. So he said, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>A scribe came and said to him, Teacher, I will go anywhere you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Another man who was a follower of Jesus, said to Jesus, Lord, let me go first and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him, Come with me. Let those who are dead bury their own dead people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Jesus got in the boat and his disciples got in with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>A bad storm came on the sea. The waves were high. Water came into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. Lord, save us! they shouted. We will die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>Jesus said to them, Why do you fear? You do not believe in God very much! Then Jesus got up. He said to the winds and the sea, Stop! Then all was quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>The disciples were surprised. They said What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>Jesus came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. There were graves in that place. Two men came from among the graves to meet him. They had bad spirits in them. They were so bad and strong that people feared to pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>They shouted, Jesus, Son of God, what do you want to do to us? Have you come here to punish us before it is our time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Many pigs were eating in a place far from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>The bad spirits begged Jesus, If you drive us out of these men, let us go into the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>Jesus said, Go! The spirits came out of the men and went into the pigs. All the pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>The men who cared for the pigs ran to the town. They told everything and what had happened to the men who had the bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>All the people in the town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to go away out of their country</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Jesus got in the boat and crossed the sea. He came to his own town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>Some men brought a sick man to him. The man could not move his arms or legs. He was lying on a bed. Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, My son, be glad! The wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>Some of the scribes were thinking, This man is not giving respect to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, Why do you think these wrong things in your heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>Which is easier, to say, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done. So he said to the sick man, Get up. Make up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>The man got up and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>Many people saw this and were much surprised. They praised God who had given such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>Jesus went on from there. He saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, Come with me. Matthew stood up and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Jesus was eating in a house. Many tax collectors and bad people came in. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>The Pharisees saw this. They said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and bad people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>Jesus heard it. He said to them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go and learn what this means: "I want you to be kind. I do not want a sacrifice." I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then Johns disciples came to Jesus. They said, We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus answered, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them. But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>People do not put new wine into old wine skins. If they do, the old skins break. The wine is lost and the skins are spoiled. New wine is put into new skins. And so they are both saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While Jesus was telling them these things, a ruler came to him. He bowed down in front of Jesus to worship him and said, My daughter has just died. But if you will come and put your hand on her, she will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>Jesus got up and went with the ruler. His disciples went too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>A woman had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time. She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turned around. He saw her and said, Daughter, be glad. You were healed because you believed. And right away the woman was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>When Jesus came to the rulers house, he saw the music players and people making a noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said to them, Go away. The girl is not dead, but sleeping. They laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>The people were told to go outside. When they were out, he went in and took the girls hand. The girl got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>People in all that part of the country heard about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>When Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, Son of David, help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>When Jesus came into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, Do you believe that I can do this? They said, Yes, sir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then Jesus touched their eyes. He said, As you believed, so will it happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>Then they were able to see. Jesus said to them, Take care, do not tell anyone about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went away and told everybody in that part of the country about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>As they were leaving, people brought a man to Jesus. This man could not talk He had a bad spirit in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>Jesus drove the bad spirit out of the man. Then he could talk. The people were very much surprised. They said, Nothing like this has ever been seen in the country of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, He drives bad spirits out of people by the power of the chief of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Jesus went around to all the cities and towns. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news of the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>He saw the many people and was sorry for them. They were troubled and they could not help themselves. They were like sheep with no one to care for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, The harvest is much. But there are not many people to gather it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Talk to the Lord of this harvest, and ask him to send out people to his harvest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them power over bad spirits so they could drive them out of people. He gave them power to heal people who were sick or weak in any way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.11.9'>Why did you go out? To see a prophet of God? Yes, I tell you, and he is much more than a prophet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.1'>About that time, Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry. They began to pick some of the grain and to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.2'>The Pharisees saw them. They said to Jesus, Look! Your disciples are doing what is not right on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.3'>But Jesus said to them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.4'>He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. Davids men ate it. David did not have the right to eat it, nor the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.5'>Have you never read in the books of the law that the priests in the temple break the Sabbath law on the Sabbath day? They are not punished for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.6'>I tell you, there is someone here who is greater than the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.7'>You do not know what this means, "I want you to be kind; I do not want a sacrifice." If you knew, then you would not have said what they did was wrong. What they did was not wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.8'>The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.9'>Jesus left that place and went into the meeting house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.10'>There was a man whose hand was thin and weak. The people asked Jesus, Is it right to heal a man on the Sabbath day? They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.11'>Jesus said to them, If one of you had a sheep and it fell into a hole on the Sabbath day,  would you not take hold of it and pull it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.12'>A man is worth much more than a sheep. So it is right to do good things on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.13'>Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man held out his hand and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.14'>Then the Pharisees went out and planned together how to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.15'>Jesus knew about their plan, so he went away from there. Many people followed him and he healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.16'>He told them not to tell where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.17'>So what Isaiah the prophet of God said, came true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.23'>All the people were surprised. They said, Is he Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.24'>The Pharisees heard about it. They said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.25'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is broken down. If one part of any city or family fights against the other part of it, it cannot stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.39'>But Jesus answered them, The people today are bad. They have gone away from God.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.40'>Jonah was inside the big sea animal for three days and three nights. So the Son of Man will be in the ground for three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.41'>When people are judged, the men of the city of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. The people of Nineveh stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.42'>When people are judged, the Queen of the South will stand up and speak against the people of today. She came a long way to hear the wise talk of Solomon. And the one who is here is greater than Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.43'>When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.44'>Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came." When he comes back, he finds it is empty, clean, and all fixed up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.3'>He taught the people many things by telling them stories. He said, Listen, a man went out to sow some seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.4'>As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much earth covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.6'>When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>But some seed fell on good ground. The seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>Everyone who has ears, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, Why do you tell the people these stories?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.11'>Jesus answered them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of heaven. But they cannot learn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.12'>Anyone who already has something will get more, and he will have plenty. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>That is why I tell them stories. They look, but they do not see. They listen, but they do not hear or understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>They make what Isaiah the prophet said long ago, come true. Isaiah said: "You will listen and listen, but you will not understand. You will look and look, but you will not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.15'>The hearts of these people have no feeling. They do not hear well with their ears. And they have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand in their hearts. They do not want to turn to me. If they did turn, I would heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>God is blessing your eyes because they see. God is blessing your ears because they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>I tell you the truth. Many prophets and good men wanted to see what you see, but they did not see them. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>So listen to hear what the story means, about the man who sowed the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>People listen to the message about the kingdom of heaven. If anyone does not understand it, the devil comes along and takes the message out of his heart. That person is like the seed which fell on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.20'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. That is like a person who hears the message and right away he is glad to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.21'>But it does not go down deep in his heart. He believes it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, he stops believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>Some seed fell among the weeds. That is like the person who hears the message. But he thinks about the things of this world. He wants to get money to be happy. These things push the message out of his heart. No good comes from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>Some seed fell on good ground. That is like a person who hears the message and understands it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred more seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave thirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>While people were sleeping, a bad man came and sowed weeds among the good seed.  Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.26'>The good seed grew and the plants gave more seeds. Then the weeds grew too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.27'>The servants came and said to the man who owned the field, "Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How did the weeds get here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.28'>He answered them, "A bad man has done this." They asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>"No," said the man. "If you pull up the weeds, then the good plants will come up with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let them both grow together until the harvest time. When it is time to cut it, I will say to the men who cut it, Cut the weeds first. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then put the grain into my storehouse."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Jesus told the people another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man took a mustard seed and planted it in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>A mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. But the plant that grows from it is bigger than other plants. It is like a tree. It is so big that birds come and live in the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Jesus told them another story. He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A woman took yeast and mixed it with many cups of flour. The yeast went all through the flour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>Jesus told the people all these things in stories. He did not tell them anything without a story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>What the prophet of God said long ago, came true. He said, I will use stories. I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jesus left the people and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said,  Tell us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>Jesus answered, The person who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world. The good seed means the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds mean those who belong to the bad one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>The bad man who planted the weeds is the devil. The harvest time is the end of this world. The men who cut the harvest are angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>The weeds are gathered and burned in a fire. That is the way it will be at the end of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send his angels. They will gather everything that is bad and the people who do bad things. They will take them out of his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>They will put them into the big fire. There they will cry and make a noise with their teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the people who are right with God will shine like the sun in their Fathers kingdom.  Everyone who has ears, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. Something worth a lot of money is buried in a field.  A man found it and covered it again. He was so glad that he went and sold everything he had. Then he bought that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. A trader was looking for fine stones called pearls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. A fish net was thrown into the sea. It caught all kinds of fish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>He went back to his home town and he taught people in their meeting house. They were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>They did not understand Jesus. Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet. But the people in his own country and home do not honour him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>His disciples saw him walking on the water. They were afraid, and said, It is a spirit!  Then they shouted loudly because they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>When they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then the men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus. They said, You really are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jesus asked them, Why do you break Gods law so that you can keep your own law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>God said, "Respect your father and your mother." And God said, "Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will surely die."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>Jesus said, Do you still not understand?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart. This is what makes a person dirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>Here is what comes from the heart: wrong thoughts, killing people, all kinds of adultery,  stealing, lying, and saying wrong things about people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These things make a person dirty. To eat with hands that are not washed does not make him dirty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Jesus left that place and went to the country of Tyre and Sidon. 22A woman of the people of Canaan was in that country. She called out, Sir, you are the Son of David.  Help me! My daughter is being troubled very much by a bad spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If they go away hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>People today are wrong. They have gone away from God. They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus went away and left them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>There will be trouble in the world because people make other people do wrong! People will do wrong. But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>If your hand or your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life without hands or feet than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>If your eye makes you do wrong, pull it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.14'>In the same way, my Father in heaven does not want one of these little children to be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>If your brother does something wrong to you, go to him. Talk alone to him and tell him what he has done. If he listens to you, you have kept your brother as a friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.16'>But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you to talk to him. Then two or three people will hear every word and can prove what was said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>If he does not listen to them, tell the church. If he does not listen to the church, treat him as one who does not believe in God and as bad as a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.18'>I tell you the truth. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.19'>I tell you another thing. If two of you on earth agree together to ask for something, my Father in heaven will do it for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.20'>Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.21'>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he does wrong things to me? Should I forgive him seven times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.22'>Jesus answered him, I say not seven times only, but seventy times seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>In that way the kingdom of heaven is like this. A king was ready to finish his business with his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>The first servant was brought in. He owed the king a very large sum of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>He could not pay it. So his master said, "Go sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he has, and pay me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>So the servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Sir, give me time. I will pay everything."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>His master was sorry for him and let him go. He did not make him pay the money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>That same servant went out and met another servant. This man owed him a much smaller sum of money. He caught him by the throat and said, Pay me what you owe me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.29'>Then this servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Give me time. I will pay you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he said, "No." He went and put the man in prison until he could pay what he owed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>The other servants saw what he did. They were very sad. They went and told their master everything that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his master called the first servant to him. He said, "You bad man! I let you go. I did not make you pay all you owed me, because you begged me to be kind to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>You should have been kind to the other servant, as I was kind to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>His master was very angry. He turned the servant over to the prison guards until he could pay all he owed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>That is like what my Father in heaven will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.19'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>When Jesus had finished this talk, he left Galilee. He went away to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>Many people followed him. He healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>The Pharisees came to Jesus to test him. They asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him for any reason?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>Jesus answered, Have you not read this? From the time God first made people, he made them a man and a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>God said, "A man must leave his father and mother and must stay with his wife. The two of them will be like one person."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>So they are not two people any more, but they are one person. Man must not separate what God has joined together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They said to Jesus, Then why did Moses make this law? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard. That is why he let you send your wives away. But in the beginning it was not that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>But I tell you this. No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery. If he does, and if he marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>The disciples said to him, If a man and woman are like that, then it is better not to marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>Jesus said, Not everyone can agree to that. But God has chosen some not to be married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>Some men cannot marry because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others said, "I will not marry, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." Anyone who can do this, should do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them and ask God to bless them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>But Jesus said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>So he put his hands on the children. Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>A man came to Jesus and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>Jesus said, Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to live for ever, you must keep Gods laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>The man said, Which laws? Jesus said, Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>Respect your father and your mother. Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man said, I have kept all those laws. What more must I do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus said, If you want to be all right, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to poor people. For this you will be rich in heaven. Then come and go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth. It is very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>And I tell you this also. It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>When the disciples heard this, they were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it, but God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter said, See, we have left all things and have come with you. So what will we have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. In the new world, the Son of Man will be great.  He will sit on his throne of glory &lt;FI&gt;big chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; to rule. Then you who have come with me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>If anyone has left his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children,  or his farms for my sake, he will receive a hundred times as much as he has left. And he will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.30'>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.20'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.1'>The kingdom of heaven is like this. A man owned a farm. Early in the morning he went out to look for men to work on his farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.2'>He agreed to pay them a days wages and sent them out to his farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.3'>About nine oclock he went out again. He saw some men standing around at the market.  They were not working.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>He said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too. I will pay you what is right." And they went to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>The man went out again at twelve oclock and at three oclock. He did the same as he had done before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>About five oclock he went out again and found other men standing around. He said to them, "Why have you been standing here all day? Why are you not working?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They said, "No man has asked us to work." So he said to them, "You go out to work on the farm too."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.8'>When evening came, the man who owned the farm said to his manager, "Call the workmen and pay them. Begin with those who came last and end with those who came first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.9'>Each of the men who started work at five oclock was paid a days wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.10'>Those who started work first thought they would get more than that. But they also were paid a days wages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>They took it, but they were angry and talked against the man who owned the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>They said, "These men came last, and worked only one hour. Yet you paid them the same as you paid us. We worked all day, when the sun was hot."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.13'>But he said to one of them, "My friend, I am not doing any wrong to you. You agreed that I should pay you a days wages. Did you not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.14'>Take your money and go. I want to give the last man the same pay as I gave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.15'>It is my own money. Can I not do with it as I like? Do you think it is a wrong thing for me to be kind?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.16'>In the same way, people who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples with him, away from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.18'>He said to them, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and scribes. They will judge him and say he must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.19'>They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews. They will make fun of him. They will beat him and nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.20'>Then Zebedees wife came with her sons to Jesus. She bowed down in front of him and asked him to do something for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.21'>Jesus asked, What do you want me to do for you? The woman said, These are my two sons. Promise that in your kingdom one may sit at your right and the other at your left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.22'>But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking for. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink? Yes, they said. We can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.23'>Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink. But I cannot choose who will sit at my right or at my left. My Father has planned who will sit there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.24'>When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with the two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.25'>But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that those who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great men will tell the others what to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.26'>But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great will help the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.27'>Anyone among you who wants to be first will be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.28'>The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.29'>As Jesus and the disciples left the city of Jericho, many people followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.30'>Two blind men were sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was passing that way. So they shouted, Sir, you are the Son of David. Help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.31'>The people said to them, Be quiet! But they shouted louder, Sir, Son of David! Help us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.32'>Jesus stopped and called the men to him. He asked, What do you want me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.33'>They said, Sir, we want to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>Jesus was very sorry for them as he shared in their suffering. He touched their eyes, and right then they were able to see. They went with him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem. They came to the village of Bethphage by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>He said to them, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find a donkey for riding, and her young one. They are tied there. Untie them and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If anyone says anything to you, tell him, "The Lord needs them. He will send them back soon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>This happened, and what the prophet of God said long ago, came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>He said, Tell the people of Zion: See, your king is coming to you. He is not proud. He rides a donkey. It is a young animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>They brought the donkey and her young one. They put their coats on them. Then Jesus got on to ride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves from the palm trees and put them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise the Son of David! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise him in heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When Jesus came into Jerusalem, all the people there were very excited. They said,  Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The people who were with Jesus said, This is Jesus from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Jesus went into the temple of God. He drove out all the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>He said to them, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Blind people came to Jesus in the temple. People who could not walk came to him. And he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>The chief priests and the scribes saw the big works that Jesus did. They saw the children calling out in the temple, God save the Son of David! They were angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>They asked Jesus, Do you hear what they are saying? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read this? "You like the praise of children and babies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany. He stayed there for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>In the morning he went back to the city. On the way he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>Along the road he saw a fig tree. He went to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. He said to the tree, No fruit will ever grow on you again! Right away the tree died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>The disciples saw it and were surprised. They said, So soon the fig tree has died!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Believe God. Do not doubt him. Then you can do what I did to this fig tree. But that is not all. You can even say to this hill, "Go and jump into the sea" and it will be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>When you ask God for anything, believe that you will have it. Then you will have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>He came to the temple and went in and taught the people. The chief priests and the leaders of the people came to him. They asked, What right have you to do these things?  Who gave you the right to do them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answered them, I will ask you a question also. If you answer me, I will answer you. I will tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say to us,  "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," we have the people to fear, because all the people say that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first one and said,  "Son, go and work today on my farm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>The son said, "No, I will not go." But he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>The man went to the second son and said the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of the two sons did what his father wanted him to do? They said, The first one.  Then Jesus said, I tell you the truth. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery by selling their bodies, are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>John came to you to tell you the right way. But you did not believe him. The tax collectors and women who commit adultery believed him. And even when you saw that,  you did not change your minds and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Listen to another story. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes.  He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit.  He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. He let some men pay to use it. Then he went to a country far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When it was near the time to cut the fruit, he sent his servants to those men. He wanted to have some of the fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>The men caught the servants. They beat one of them and killed another one of them.  They threw stones at another one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Then the man sent other servants. There were more than the first time. The men did the same to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>Last of all he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>When the men saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him and we will have it all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>They caught him, dragged him off the farm, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When the owner of the farm comes, what will he do to those men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They answered, He will kill those bad men, and will give the farm to other men who will give him the fruit when it is time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said, Have you never read in the holy writings "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>So I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you. It will be given to the people who do what they should do in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>If anyone falls on this stone, he will be broken to pieces. But if this stone falls on anyone,  it will crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the stories Jesus told, and they knew he was talking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>They wanted to catch him, but they feared the people. The people thought Jesus was a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Jesus told them other stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>He said, The kingdom of heaven is like this. A king made a wedding for his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.3'>The king sent his servants to call the people who had been asked to the wedding. But they would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>He sent other servants to call them. He said, "Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked. The cows and bullocks have been killed. Everything is ready.  Come now to the wedding."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>The people did not listen, but went away. One went to his farm. One went to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>The others caught his servants, treated them very badly, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants.  And he burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready. But those who were asked to come were not good enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Go out on the roads. Call all the people you find to come to the wedding."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants went out on the roads. They brought all the people they could find,  both bad and good people. Then the room was full of people for the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>The king came in to look at the people. He saw one man there who was not wearing the right clothes for a wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>The king said to him, "My friend, why did you come here without putting on the right clothes for a wedding?" The man did not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and his feet. Put him in a dark place outside. People there will cry and grind &lt;FI&gt;make a noise with&lt;Fi&gt; their teeth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>Many people are asked to come, but only a few are chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went away. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>They sent their disciples to him with some of Herods people. They said, Teacher, we know that you are true. We know that you teach the true way of God. You do not fear any person, or care how great he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>So tell us. What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? You are not true to yourselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me a piece of money used for tax. They brought him a piece of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>Whose picture and name is this? he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They said, Caesars.Then he said to them, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God what belongs to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>When they heard that, they were surprised. They left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>They came to ask him a question. They said, Teacher, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and has no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>There were seven brothers among us. The first one married. He died and left no children.  So his brother married the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>The same thing happened to the second brother, and the third one, and all seven of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>Last of all, the woman died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Now then, when people rise from death, which of the seven brothers will have her for his wife? They all married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answered, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>People do rise from death! Have you never read what God said to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." He is not the God of dead people, but of living people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>When the people heard this, they were surprised at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So they got together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>One of them was a man who taught Gods law. He asked Jesus a question to try him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Teacher, he said, which law is the greatest law of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul,  and love him with all your mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and greatest law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>The second law of God is like it. "Love your neighbour as you love yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>All that is written in the books of the law and the books of the prophets is about these two laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them a question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>He said, What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? They said, He is Davids son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>Jesus asked, Then how can David call him "Lord"? He said, by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>No one could answer him a word. And after that day, everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.23'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.1'>Then Jesus talked to the people and to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.2'>He said, The scribes and Pharisees have taken Moses place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.3'>So obey and do everything they tell you to do. But do not do what they do. They say what should be done, but they do it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.4'>They make heavy loads and put them on peoples backs. But they themselves will not put up even one finger to help carry the loads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.5'>They do all their work to be seen by people. They wear bigger and bigger boxes with Gods word in. And they make wider and wider borders on their gowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.6'>They want to sit in the best places at the feasts. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.7'>They want people to greet them in the market, and to call them "Teacher".</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.8'>But people should not call you "Teacher". You have one Teacher. And you are all brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.9'>Do not call anyone on earth your "Father". You have one Father. He is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.10'>People should not call you "Master". You have one Master. He is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.11'>The person who is greatest among you will help the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.12'>Anyone who puts himself up will be brought down. And anyone who puts himself down will be brought up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.13'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You are not true to yourselves! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven so people cannot go in. You yourselves do not go in,  and you stop those who were going in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.14'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. You cover up your wrong ways by talking big to God for a long time. Because of that, you will be punished harder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.15'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You travel over sea and land to win one person to believe what you believe. And when he believes, you make him twice as fit for hell as you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.16'>You blind leaders will have trouble. You say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of the temple, he does not have to keep that promise. But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the gold on the temple, he must keep that promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.17'>You fools and blind men! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.18'>And you say that if anyone makes a promise in the name of Gods altar, he does not have to keep that promise. But if anyone makes a promise in the name of the sacrifice, he must keep that promise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.23.20'>So if anyone makes a promise by Gods altar, he makes his promise by it and by all that is on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.21'>If anyone makes a promise by the temple, he makes his promise by the temple and by God who lives in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.22'>If anyone makes a promise by heaven, he makes his promise by Gods big chair called a throne and by God who sits on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.23'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You give God a tenth part of small garden plants. But you have not done those bigger matters of the law. You have not judged in the right way. You have not been kind. You have not believed God. You should be doing these things and the other things too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.24'>You blind leaders! You take a fly out of your cup, but you drink down a big animal like a camel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.25'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean. But inside they are full of greed and wrong ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.26'>You blind Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish so that the outside will be clean too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.27'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You are like graves that have been painted white. Outside they look very nice. But inside they are full of dead mens bones and all kinds of dirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.28'>So it is with you. You look right on the outside. But inside you are full of lies and wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.29'>You scribes and Pharisees will have trouble. You who are not true to yourselves! You build places to bury the prophets and fix up graves of good men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.30'>You say, "If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have helped to kill the prophets of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.31'>So you prove that you are the sons of the men who killed the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.32'>Finish doing what your fathers started to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.33'>You snakes-a whole family of snakes! You cannot get away! You will be judged and sent to hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.34'>That is why I send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them and nail them to a cross. And you will beat some of them in your meeting houses and trouble them from one town to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.35'>So you will be punished for all the blood of every good man that is on the ground. I mean all the blood from the time of Abel, who was a good man, to Zechariah, the son of Barachiah. You killed him between the temple and Gods altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.36'>I tell you the truth. The people who are still living now will be punished for all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.37'>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets. You throw stones to kill the men who are sent to you! How often I have wanted to gather your people together, as a mother hen gathers her little ones under her wings. But you would not come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.38'>Now you are left alone in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.39'>I tell you this. You will not see me again until the time when you say, "God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.34'>Then the King will say to those who are at his right side, "Come! My Father has blessed you. The kingdom was made ready for you when the world was first made. Come into it now.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>When Jesus had finished telling all these things, he talked to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>He said, You know that after two days it will be time for the Passover Feast. The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, Why was the oil wasted like that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>He said, What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from then on, Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus. Supper</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said, Go into the city to a certain man. Say to him, "The Teacher says, My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>As they were eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>Jesus answered them, The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him. He said,  Master, is it I? Jesus said, Yes, it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, All of you drink from this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>This is my blood. My blood is the blood of the new agreement. It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>I tell you this. I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again, until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This night, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! All the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?  The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>Right then he went to Jesus and said, Greetings, Master! And he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, Friend, why have you come? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But then, how would Gods word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that same time Jesus said to the people, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught.  But you did not try to catch me then.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.  Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>They said, This man said, "I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus answered him, Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think? They said, He should be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>They said, Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, You were also with Jesus of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But Peter said in front of them all, I do not know what you are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Peter said some bad words and then said, I do not know the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, I do not know the man! Right then, a cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me. Then Peter went out and cried very much.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When it was morning, all the chief priests and the leaders of the people made a plan against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>They tied him and took him away. They took him to Pilate, the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Judas was the man who helped them take Jesus. He saw that they had judged Jesus and were going to kill him. He was sorry for what he had done, so he brought the thirty pieces of silver money back to the chief priests and leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>He said, I have done wrong. I have helped you take a good man who should not be killed. They said, What do we care? You look after that!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Judas threw the silver money into the temple. He went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The chief priests took the money. They said, It is not right to put this money in the money box of the temple. It has been used to buy a mans death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>They talked the matter over and bought a field that belonged to a man who made pots.  They bought it for a place in which to bury strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>That is why that field has been called The field of blood until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>What Jeremiah the prophet said long ago, then came true at that time. He said, They took thirty pieces of silver money. That is what the people of Israel said he was worth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>They paid for the potters field. That is what the Lord told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Jesus stood before the ruler. The ruler asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>When the chief priests and leaders brought their complaints, Jesus said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear what these people say against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But Jesus did not answer him, not even one word. Pilate was very much surprised about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free. He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>In the prison at that time was a very bad man named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So while the people were there Pilate asked them, Which one do you want me to let free for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>Pilate knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus. He knew that was why they had brought Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While Pilate was sitting in the court to judge the case, his wife sent a message to him. She said, Do nothing to that good man. I have been troubled very much in a dream about him today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>The chief priests and leaders talked to the people. They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free, but to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The ruler said to the people, Which of these two do you want me to let go free for you?  They said, Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said,  Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>The ruler said, What wrong thing has he done? But they shouted even more, Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Pilate saw that he was not doing any good. And the people were making a lot of loud noise. So he washed his hands in water in front of the people. Then he said, I will not say this man must be killed. You must do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>Then all the people answered, We and our children will do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then Pilate let Barabbas go free. He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then Pilates soldiers took Jesus to a room. They called all the soldiers together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They took off his clothes, and they put a red gown on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they kneeled down in front of him and made fun of him. They shouted,  Greetings, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spat on him. And they took the stick and hit him on the head with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>After they had made fun of him, they took off the red gown. They put his own clothes on him. Then they took him away to nail him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they were going, they met a man named Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him carry Jesus cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>They came to a place called Golgotha. That means, The place of a head bone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter. Jesus tasted it but he would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>Then they nailed him to a cross. They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus  clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then the soldiers sat down on the ground and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>They put the complaint against Jesus above his head. These words were written there:  This is Jesus the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Two bad men were also nailed to crosses. They had stolen money. One man was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>The people who passed by said bad things about him. They shook their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>They said, You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days. Save yourself! If you are really Gods Son, come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders also made fun of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>They said, He saved other people but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. Then we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God. If God wants him, he can save him now. He said, "I am Gods Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>The bad men who were also nailed to crosses with him said the same things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>About midday, the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About three oclock, Jesus called out loud, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That means, My God, my God, why have you left me alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said This man is calling for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Right away, one of them ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The other people said, Wait. We will see if Elijah will come and save him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Jesus called out loud again. Then he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>At that time the thick cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom. The earth shook and big rocks broke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>The graves opened. Many of Gods people who had died rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>They came out of their graves after Jesus rose from death. They went into Jerusalem.  Many people saw them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>The Roman captain and some of his soldiers were guarding Jesus on the cross. When they saw the earth shake and the other things happen, they were very much afraid. They said, Surely this man was Gods Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Many women were there watching from far away. They had come with Jesus from Galilee and had helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among these women were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedees sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>In the evening, a rich man came. He was Joseph from the town of Arimathea. He also believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate said that it should be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body and wrapped a clean linen cloth around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>He put the body in his own new grave which had been cut in a rock. He rolled a very big stone to close the grave. Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there. They sat where they could see the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>The next day was the Sabbath day. The chief priests and Pharisees went to Pilate together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>They said, Sir, that man fooled people. We remember what he said when he was still living. He said that he would rise after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>So give orders that the grave must be guarded for three days. Then his disciples cannot come in the night to carry away his body, and tell people he rose from death. This last trick would be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, Take soldiers. Go and guard the grave as well as you can.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and shut the grave tight. They put a government mark on the big stone. And the soldiers stayed to guard it. This was to make sure the grave would stay shut.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>The Sabbath day was past. Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel talked to the women. He said, Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus,  who was nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there." Now, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy.  They ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>As they were going, Jesus met them. He said Greetings! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city. They told the chief priests all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over.  They gave much money to the soldiers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came and talked to them. He said, All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>So go and make disciples in all countries. Baptise them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teach them to do all the things I have told you to do. I am with you always, even to the end of time.</verse>
