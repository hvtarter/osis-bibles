        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>I am Paul. I am called by God to be an apostle of Jesus Christ. My Christian brother Timothy and I send greetings to the church of God in the city of Corinth. We also send greetings to all of Gods people in the country of Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you with their loving kindness and peace. Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is a very, very kind Father to us. He is a God who always comforts and helps people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>He helps us every time we have trouble. Then we are able to be strong and help other people every time they have trouble. We can do this with the same comfort that God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>We have plenty of the same troubles that Christ had. But we also have plenty of comfort and help from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>When we have trouble, it is for your sake so that you will be helped and saved. When we are comforted, this helps you. Then you will stand strong when you have the same troubles we have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Our hope for you is strong. If you have the same trouble we have had, then you will also have the same comfort and help we have. This we know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>Brothers, we want you to know about the trouble we had in the country of Asia Minor.  We were not strong enough to carry such a load of trouble. It was so heavy we thought we would die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>Yes, we really felt our time had come to die. This was to make us trust, not in ourselves,  but in God. He brings people back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>He saved us from the death that was so near, and he still saves us. We believe that God will keep on saving us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>But you must help us also. You must talk to God about us. When many people ask God to help us, then many people will thank God for the way he has blessed us. ourselves.  Our hearts tell us that we have lived the right way in the world, and even more so toward you. We have lived a clean and true life as God wants us to. We have not trusted in the wise things of men, but in the blessing of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>We write you nothing but what you have been reading out to the people, and what you all know. I hope that you will really know what is right even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>You already know something about us. I hope that you will come to know us fully. On the day when the Lord Jesus comes you will be proud of us. So too will we be proud of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to visit you before. Then you would have had a double blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>I wanted to visit you and then go to Macedonia. I wanted to visit you again when I was on my way back from Macedonia. Then you would send me on my way to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>That was what I wanted to do. Now then, did I act as if I did not know what I wanted?  When I make my plans, do you think I make them like a man of this world? Do I say Yes when I mean to say No?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>As surely as God is true, our message to you was not Yes and No at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Silvanus and Timothy and I told you about the Son of God, Jesus Christ. His word was not Yes and No. It was always Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>To the many promises God has made Christ can say Yes.He can make them all come true. So then, it is because of Christ that we can say, Yes, it is so! when we praise God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>It is God who makes us stand strong with you in Christ. God has chosen us and put his mark on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>He has put his Spirit in our hearts. This is the first part of what we are to receive, and it proves that we will receive all God has promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Let God take my life if what I say is not true. I did not go to Corinth because I did not want to make you sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>We do not rule over what you believe. But we work with you to make you glad. You are strong already by believing as you do.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>I made up my mind that I would not go to visit you again if I had to make you sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sad, who is going to make me glad? No one, but the one I made sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>That is why I wrote the letter. I did not want to come and be made sad by those who should make me glad. I am sure that what makes me glad makes you all glad too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>When I wrote to you, I was in great trouble and my heart was very heavy. I cried with many tears. I did not want you to be sad, but I just wanted to let you know that I love you very much who made me sad. It was not only me that he made sad. It was every one of you, in a way. I say in a way because I do not want to be too strong in what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>That man has been punished enough by what most of you did to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>So now, you ought to forgive him and comfort him. If you do not, then he may be so sad he cannot bear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So I beg you, show your love to him again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Here is why I wrote to you. I wanted to test you to find out if you obey me in all matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. And if I have had anything to forgive, I have already forgiven it for your sakes, just as if we were standing before Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>I have done this so that Satan will not get ahead of us. We know his tricks. of Troas to tell the good news of Christ, the door was open for me to work for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>But my mind was troubled because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to the people there and went on to the country of Macedonia. Christ. And Christ leads us to victory every time. To know Christ is like a sweet smell. And God lets us carry that sweet smell of his truth everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>We are like a sweet smell to God. It is the smell of Christ we have. We have this sweet smell among the people who are saved and among those who are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>To some it smells like death and brings death to those who are lost. To others it smells like life and it brings life to those who are saved. Who is good enough for such things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>We are not like some people. They tell Gods message to make money. But we tell it with a true heart just as God told it to us. We tell it as if we stood before God. And we tell it with Christs help.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do you think we are starting again to tell how good we are? Do we need letters to tell about us, as some teachers do? We do not need letters to you or from you to praise us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You yourselves are our letter. This letter has been written in our hearts. All people can read it and understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>All can see that you are a letter from Christ written by us. It is not written in ink, but it is written in the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on pieces of rock, but on the hearts of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>We can say this because we trust in God. And we trust in God because of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>We are not good enough to think we can do anything ourselves. But God makes us able to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>God has made a new start with people. He has given us a new way back to God. It is not a written law. The Spirit gives it to us. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>The old law that brought death was written on pieces of rock. There was a very bright light when God gave it to the people. The people of Israel could not look at Moses because his face was so bright. And even as they saw it, the light on his face was going away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>Now bringing the law was bright and wonderful. Will not bringing the Spirit be far more bright and wonderful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>Bringing the law was a wonderful thing even though it brought death. So bringing the good news that people can be put right with God is much more wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>The law was so bright and wonderful at first but has no light now. There is something else that is so much more bright and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>The one which does not stay alive for ever came first in a great light. Does not the one which does stay alive have a much brighter light?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Because we believe this, we do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>We are not like Moses. He put a cloth over his face so that the people of Israel would not see that the light from God was dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were made dull. Even today, when the old law of God is read, it is as if a cloth still covers it. It is Christ who takes the cloth away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>Yes, even today, when the books of Moses are read, it is as if a cloth covers their hearts and minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But when a man turns to the Lord, the cloth is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, people are set free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>All of us have no cloth over our faces. People can see that we have some of the bright and wonderful light that the Lord has. And we are becoming brighter and brighter, more and more like him. It is the Lord, the Spirit, who does this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>God in his kindness gave us this work. So we do not give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>We never do wrong things nor do things in secret. We do not fool people nor change Gods message. No, we tell people the truth openly. We let every person judge us for himself. We know that God sees all we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>If the good news which we tell is not clear to some people, it is because they are lost.  They do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>The god of this world has covered their minds so they cannot see. They cannot see with their minds the light of the good news of Christ. They cannot see how bright and wonderful Christ is. He is just like God himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>We do not talk about ourselves, but about Christ Jesus our Lord. And we are your slaves for Jesus sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>God said, Let light shine in the darkness. And he has let light shine in our hearts too. He gave us light that shows how bright and wonderful God is. We see this light when we look at the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>This is something of great value within us, but we are like pots made of earth and clay.  This power is greater than any other power. But it comes from God, not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We have much trouble, but we do not give up. We are in hard places, but help always comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>People trouble us, but God is always with us. We are beaten, but we are not killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>We always feel as if our body is dying, just as Jesus died. Then the life of Jesus also can be seen in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>While we live we are always ready to die for Jesus. And so the life of Jesus is also seen in our bodies which will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then, while death is at work in us, life is at work at the same time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>We believe the same way as the one who wrote, I believed, and so I talked. We also believe, and so we talk to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>We know this. God raised up the Lord Jesus, and he will raise us up also with Jesus. He will bring us all to stand together before God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>The load of trouble we carry now is a little heavy. But this trouble is getting something great and wonderful ready for us which will last for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>We are not looking at things that can be seen, but at things that cannot be seen. The things which can be seen last only a little while. But the things which cannot be seen last for ever.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>Our body is the house in which our spirit lives here on earth. When that house is destroyed, then God will give us another house. That house is not made by mans hand.  But God made it. It will last for ever in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>While we are in the house we have now, we are always crying and wanting to have our house from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>When we have moved into it, then we are sure that we will never be left without a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>While we are in this house, we cry and are troubled. It is not that we want to move out of this house, but we want to move into the other one. Then this body which will die will be changed into one which will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>God is the one who has made us ready for this change. He has already given us the Spirit.  This is the first part of what we are to receive, and it proves that we will get more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>So we always feel sure. While we live in our bodies we are not in our house with the Lord. We know that.</verse>

If we have not done well, our pay will not be good. must be feared, so we try to get people to believe. God knows what we are and what we do. And we hope that in your hearts you, too, know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>No, we are not praising ourselves again. But we are telling you this so that you may really be proud of us. Then you will be ready to answer people who are proud of themselves.  They are proud of the things which can be seen.But in their hearts they have nothing to be proud of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>If we are crazy, it is for Gods sake. If we are right in our minds, it is for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>The love of Christ makes us do what we do to win men. We believe that one man died for all people. &lt;FI&gt;To God&lt;Fi&gt; it is as if we all died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>He died for all, so that those who live would not live to please themselves. But they should live to please him who gave his life for them and rose again from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>So then we no longer know people by what we see on the outside. There was a time when we knew Christ that way, but now we do not know him that way any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So, if any man belongs to Christ, he is a new person. His old life has gone. You see, he has begun a new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>But it is God who has done all this. He sent Christ to make peace with us and to bring us back to himself. Now he has given us the work of bringing other people back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>God was in Christ. He brought the world back to himself. He forgave them for the wrong things they had done. And he gave us the message that will bring people back to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>So we are messengers for Christ. God is using us to call people. So we are standing here for Christ and begging people, Come back to God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Christ did no wrong thing. But for our sake God put the blame for our wrong ways on Christ. So now God sees us as good, because we are in Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>I know that what I wrote in my letter made you sad. But I am not sorry I wrote it.  Perhaps I was sorry at first, but now I am glad I sent it. I see the letter made you sad for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>I do not like to make you sad, but I am glad that it made you sad and made you turn from your wrong ways. You took it all as from God. So then, we did not really hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>When we are sad the way God wants us to be, we turn from our wrong ways. Then we are saved and we can never be sorry about that. But the sorrow of the world brings death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>See what happened. When you were sad, the way God wanted you to be, then you tried to do the right thing. You wanted to free yourself from wrong. You hated what is wrong.  You were afraid. You wanted very much to do what is right. You stood for the right. You punished wrong doing. In every way you showed that you did right in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>So, even though I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the man who did wrong.  And it was not for the sake of the man who had the wrong done to him. But I wrote so that you would see for yourselves, in the sight of God, how much we care for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>And so we have been comforted. Besides this, we were even more happy to see how happy Titus was. All of you really made his heart glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>I told him how proud I was of you. And really, I had nothing to be ashamed of.  Everything we have said to you has been true. So also, what we told Titus about you proved true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>They are being tested by much trouble. But they are always very happy. And they are very poor. Because of these two things, they give to others as if they were rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>I can tell you because I saw it myself. They gave as much as they could and even more than that. They did it all because they wanted to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>They begged us to let them give something to help Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And they did more than we thought they would do. First, they gave themselves to the Lord and to us, because we were doing Gods work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>That is why we asked Titus to see about your gift. He started you off in your giving. And so he is the one to see that you finish it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>We remember how well you do in everything. You do well in believing, in talking, in knowing things, in trying your best, and in the way you love us. So now, do well in giving this gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I am not saying that you must do it. But I want to prove how strong your love is. That is why I have told you how other people show their love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>You know how much love our Lord Jesus Christ had. He was rich, but he became poor for your sakes. Because he became poor, you can become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>I tell you what I think. It is best for you to finish what you started a year ago. You were the first to think of helping, and you started to give money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>So now, finish doing it. You wanted to do it, so now finish it. Give as much as you can.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>We are sending another brother with him. This brother has a good name in all the churches because he tells the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>Not only that, but the churches have chosen him to travel with us as we take care of this gift. We are doing this so that the Lord will be praised. We want to help others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>We do not want anyone to say that we have not done the right thing. So we are taking care of this big gift in the right way. 21We want to do what the Lord says is right, but also what people say is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>And we are also sending another brother with them. We have found him to be glad to help us in many matters, many times. And now he is much more glad to help because he trusts you very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>I want to say this. Titus is my close friend and he works with me. And about our other brothers, they have been sent by the churches. They bring praise to Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>I beg you, do not force me to talk hard words when I come. I have made up my mind to talk hard words against some people. They think we are living for the things in this world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Now, my brothers, in closing I say, Goodbye. Be what you should be. Listen to what I say. Be good to each other. Agree with one another. Live in peace with one another. And the God who gives love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All of Gods people send greetings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>And to all of you I say, May the kindness and blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ be upon you. May God show you his love. May you all have the Holy Spirit with you.</verse>
