        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>From the leader of the church people. I send greetings to the lady whom God has chosen,  and to her children. I love you all because you have the truth about Christ. I am not the only one who loves you. All those who know the truth, love you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>We love you because of the truth we share which is in our hearts and will be with us for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Fathers son, will bless us. They will be kind to us.  They will give us peace. They will do these things because they are true, and they love us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I was very glad to find that some of your children are living in the right way. They are living the way the Father told us to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I want to ask you to do something. I am not telling you to do something new. It is the same law we had from the beginning. It is this, We must love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>We love God when we live the way God has told us. This is the law you heard from the beginning. You must live by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>Many men who fool people have gone out into the world. They believe that Jesus Christ did not come to live as a man with a body. These men belong to the one who fools people. He is against Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Everyone who goes too far, and does not believe what Christ taught, does not believe God. Anyone who believes what Christ taught, believes both the Father and the Son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>Anyone who greets him helps him in the wrong things he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>I have much to write to you. But I do not want to write it on paper. I hope to come to visit you and talk with you. Then we will be very happy.</verse>
