        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>The Word of life always was living, even from the beginning. We heard him. We saw him with our own eyes. We looked at him, and we touched him with our own hands. We are writing to you about this Word of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>This life came to earth. We saw him, and we know about him. And we tell you about this life that lives for ever. This life was with the Father and came to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>We tell you also what we have seen and heard. We tell you so that you also will belong with us. And we belong with the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>We write these things to you so that we all will be very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>God is like light and he is not dark at all. That is the message we heard from him. That is the message we are telling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>Do we say that we belong with him? And at the same time, do we live in the dark? Then what we say is not true, and what we do is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>Do we live in the light, as God is in the light? Then we belong with others who belong to him. And the blood of the death of Jesus Christ makes us clean from all the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>Do we say, We have no wrong ways?Then we are fooling ourselves, and we do not know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>Let us tell God about our wrong ways. God can be trusted. He does what is right. He will forgive us for the wrong things we have done. He will make us clean from all that was wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>Do we say, We have not done anything wrong?This is like saying that God is not true.  That means we do not accept Gods word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not do wrong things. But if anyone does something wrong, we have a Friend to help us. He speaks to God for us. He is Jesus Christ who does what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>He himself is the sacrifice God offered to pay for the wrong we have done. And he pays for the wrong things all people in all the world have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>We can be sure that we know him when we obey his laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>If any man says, I know him and does not obey his laws, he is telling a lie. He does not know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But if any man obeys his word, he really loves God. Here is the way that we may be sure that we belong to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>If any man says he belongs to him, he must live in the same way Christ lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>My dear brothers, I am not writing you a new law. This is an old law. You had it from the beginning. The old law is the word which you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>But in a way, I am writing you a new law. The darkness is going away and the true light is shining already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>Does anyone say he is in the light, and hates his brother? Then he is still in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>The man who loves his brother lives in the light. There is nothing in him to make him do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But the man who hates his brother is in the dark. He lives in the dark. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has made him blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>Children, I am writing to you because God has forgiven the wrong things you have done.  Your wrong ways have been forgiven because of what Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>Fathers, I am writing to you because you know the One who has lived from the beginning. Young men, I am writing to you because you have won the victory over the devil. Children, I write to you because you know Father God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>Fathers, I write to you because you know him, the one who has lived from the beginning.  Young men, I write to you because you are strong. You believe Gods word. You have won the victory over the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world, or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, he does not love the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>Nothing in the world comes from the Father. I mean the wrong things people like to do with their bodies. I mean the things people see and want to have. I mean all the things people are proud of in this life. These things come from the world, not the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world will go away and all the things in it that people like to do. But the person who does what God wants him to do will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Children, we are very near the end of time. You have heard that someone will come who is against Christ. Many who are against Christ have already come. That is how we know that we are very near the end of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They left us, but they did not belong with us. If they had belonged with us, they would have stayed with us. But they left us so that people could see that all of them did not belong with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But the Holy One has given you a gift of understanding so that you all may know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I write to you, not because you do not know what is true, but because you do know. And you know that no lie is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who then is the one who says what is not true? It is the one who says that Jesus is not the Christ. That person is against Christ, because he says there is no Father and there is no Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Everyone who says Jesus is not the Son does not know the Father. And everyone who says Jesus is the Son knows the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>So keep what you have heard from the beginning. If you keep what you have heard from the beginning, you too belong to the Son and to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And he himself has promised us that we will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I have written these things to you about the ones who try to fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>You have a gift of understanding from Christ. That gift stays with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His gift teaches you about everything. It is true. It is not a lie. So stay with him as he has taught you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>Now, my children, stay with Christ. Then we will not be afraid on that day when we see him again. We will not be ashamed to stand before him when he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>You know that he does what is right. So you know also that everyone who does what is right is his child.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>See how much the Father has loved us! We are called Gods children. It is true, we are Gods children. People in this world did not know him and so they do not know us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>My dear brothers, we are Gods children now. No one knows yet what we shall be like.  But we know that when Jesus comes, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>Everyone who has this hope about Christ makes his life holy. He makes his life holy and clean, just as Christ is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who does wrong things is breaking Gods law. Doing wrong things is breaking the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>You know that Christ came to take away the wrong things people have done. He is the one who has done no wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Everyone who stays with him does not do wrong things. Everyone who does wrong things has never seen him and has never known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>My children, do not let anyone fool you. Anyone who does what is good, is good just as Christ is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>Anyone who does what is wrong belongs to the devil. The devil has done what is wrong from the beginning. That is why Gods Son came. He came to stop what the devil does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who is Gods child does wrong things, because Gods life is in him. And he cannot keep on doing wrong things, because he is Gods child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>This is how people can know who are Gods children and who are the devils children.  Everyone who does not do right is not Gods child. And anyone who does not love his brother is not Gods child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>This is the word you have heard from the beginning. We must love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>We must not be like Cain. He was a child of the devil and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? He killed him because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>My brothers, do not be surprised if people in this world hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have gone from death to life. We know this because we love the Christian brothers. Anyone who does not love them has not gone from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Everyone who hates his brother is like a man who kills a person. And you know that no one who kills a person has life that will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>Christ died for us. That is how we know what love is. We also should be willing to die for our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>Perhaps a man has plenty of food and things. He sees that his brother needs some. If he does not want to help his brother, does he love God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My children, we must not only talk about loving people; we must show we love people by what we do for them. We must really love them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And this is how we will know that we are true. This is why we will not be afraid in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>Even if our hearts think we are wrong, God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>My dear brothers, if our hearts do not think we are wrong, we will not be afraid in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>If we ask God for something, we get it. We get it because we obey his laws. We get it because we do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>This is his law. We must believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. And we must love one another as he told us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>If anyone obeys his laws, he belongs to God and God belongs to him. God has given us the Holy Spirit. That is how we know that God is with us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>My dear brothers, do not trust every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they belong to God. There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world.  And that is why the people of the world listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves others is Gods child and he knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>But anyone who does not love others does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>This is how God showed his love for us. He sent his only Son into the world to give us life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>This is love! We did not love God, but he loved us. And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>My dear brothers, if God loved us so much, we must love one another also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No man has ever seen God. But God lives in us if we love one another. And in loving one another, his love is made perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>He has given us of his own Spirit. That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>If anyone says, Jesus is the Son of God, God is in him and he is in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>We know and we believe that God loves us. God is love. And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>That is why we love each other very much. Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged. We are like Christ in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>Where Gods love is, there is no fear. Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love others because God first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If anyone says, I love God,and he hates his brother, he is telling a lie. If he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>God gave us this law. The person who loves God must love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child. And everyone who loves the Father loves his child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>This is how we know we love Gods children. We love God and we obey his laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>We show that we love God when we obey his laws. His laws are not hard to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>Everyone who is Gods child wins a victory over the world. We win because we believe God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who wins a victory over the world? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came. There was not water only, but there was water and there was blood. The Spirit proves this is true, because the Spirit is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>There are three in heaven who prove it is true. They are the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>There are three on earth who prove it is true. They are the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three all prove the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>We believe what people prove to us. But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove. This is what God proved about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>Anyone who believes in Gods Son believes what God says about him. Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true. He has not believed what God says about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>Here is what God says. He has given us life that will last for ever. And this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>So anyone who has the Son has this life. Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God. I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And we are sure God will do this. If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have, he will listen to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything, then we know that we have what we asked him for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong, but not so bad that he must die for it.  The man should ask God and God will let his brother live. God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them. But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them. If he has done such as that, I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>Everything that is wrong is a bad thing. But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that any child of God does not do wrong things. The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>We know that the Son of God has come. He has given us a heart to know him who is true. We belong to him who is true, because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He has the life that will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>My children, have nothing to do with false gods or idols.</verse>
