        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>I am Paul the apostle, a messenger from God. Men did not call me to be an apostle. Men did not make me an apostle. Jesus Christ and God the Father made me an apostle. It was the same God the Father who raised Jesus from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>All the Christian brothers who are with me and I, send greetings. To the churches in the province of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you with his loving kindness and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>Christ gave his life to pay for the wrong things we have done. He did this to set us free from the wrong ways of this world. This is what our God and Father wanted him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>All the praise for this belongs to God for ever and ever. Yes, it does!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am very much surprised. It is so soon, and you are leaving God who called you by the love of Christ. Instead you are listening to another good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>There is really no other good news. But some people are making you think wrong things.  They want to change the good news of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>We are wrong if we tell you a different kind of good news. Even an angel from heaven is wrong to tell you something different. Let a punishment from God come upon us if we tell you a different kind of good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>We have said it before, and I say it again now. A curse be on any one who tells you a kind of good news which is not the good news we have already told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>Now, am I trying to please men or God? If I were still trying to please men, then I would not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>My brothers, I want you to know this. The good news which I told you is not mans good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>No man told it to me. No man taught it to me. But it was Jesus Christ who showed it to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>You have heard how I lived while I was still under the law of the Jews. I troubled the church of God very much. And I even tried to stop the church people altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>I knew more about the law of the Jews than many of my own age among my people. I wanted much more than they did to obey the laws which our fathers passed down to us,  even the ones that were not written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But God chose me to be an apostle before I was born. And he called me by his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>God wanted to show his Son to me so that I might tell people who are not Jews about him. I did not go and ask any other person about the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>I did not go to Jerusalem to the men who were apostles before I was. But I went away into the country of Arabia. Then afterwards, I came back to the city of Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Three years later, I went to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>James, the brother of the Lord, was the only other apostle I saw. I did not see any of the other apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>God knows that what I am writing to you is not a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>After I had been at Jerusalem, I went to the countries of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>At that time the churches of Christ in Judea did not know me. They had never seen me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>They only heard people say, This is the man who used to trouble us and he is now telling others to believe what he once tried to stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And they praised God for what had happened to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem again. This time I went with Barnabas and I took Titus with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>God showed me that I should go. And I told them about the good news which I tell to people who are not Jews. I told those who seemed to be church leaders when I was alone with them. I did not want my work to come to nothing-the work I had done or the work I was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>Titus was with me. He was not a Jew, but they did not force him to be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;have the mark of a Jew made on his body&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But some men got in who were not true brothers. They came in secretly to spy on us to find out things about us. They did not want us to be free the way Christ Jesus has made us free. But they wanted to make us obey the old laws again &lt;FI&gt;which were given to Moses by God&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>But we did not let them tell us what to do, no, not even for one minute. In that way the real good news will be yours always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>Those men who seemed to be leaders did not teach me anything new. It does not matter to me who they were. God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>No, the leaders saw that God called me to take the good news to those who are not circumcised &lt;FI&gt;not Jews&lt;Fi&gt; , just as he called Peter to take the good news to those who are circumcised &lt;FI&gt;Jews&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>The same God who made Peter an apostle to the Jews made me an apostle to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>The leaders saw that God had blessed me. James, Peter, and John seemed to be leaders in the church. They saw that God had blessed me. So they accepted Barnabas and me as fellow workers. They agreed that we should go to the people who were not Jews and they themselves would go to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>One thing they asked us to do was to help the poor Christians. I was very glad to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>One day Peter came to the city of Antioch. Then I had to tell him face to face that he had done wrong. He really was wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>Here is what happened. Peter ate with those who were not Jews. Then some men came whom James had sent. When they came he stopped eating with those who were not Jews. He was afraid of what the Jews might think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>All the other Jewish Christians did the same as Peter did. They acted as if it was not right to eat with those who were not Jews. Even Barnabas did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But I saw they were not doing right. They were not obeying the true teaching of the good news. So I said to Peter in front of them all, You are a Jew. But you live the way people do who are not Jews. How then can you force those who are not Jews to live the way the Jews do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We ourselves were born Jews. We are not of those who still follow wrong ways, those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>Yet we know that God does not call a man good because he tries to obey the law of the Jews. But we know that God puts a man right because he believes in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ. And we are put right with God because we believe in Christ and not because we obey the law. No person will ever be called good by God just because he tries to obey the law of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>We came to Christ to be put right with God. That showed us how much we had been bad men. Was it Christ who made us bad men? No, surely not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>If I build up again what I once broke down, I do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>Through the law I died. Now the law has no power over me so that I may live for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I died when Christ died on a cross. I do not live now, but Christ lives in me. Now while I still live in my body, I live by believing in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>So I do not make the love of God useless. But if a person can be made good by the law,  then Christ died for nothing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O you Galatians, have you no sense at all? Who has fooled you? You knew, just as if you had seen him with your own eyes, that Jesus Christ was killed on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>Here is one thing I want to ask you. You received the Holy Spirit. Was that because you obeyed the law &lt;FI&gt;given to the Jews by Moses&lt;Fi&gt; ? No, it was because you heard Gods word and believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Have you no sense at all? You began living your new life by the power of the Spirit. And are you now trying to finish living it by your own power &lt;FI&gt;to keep the law&lt;Fi&gt; ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>So many things happened to you. Was it all for nothing? Surely it was not for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>God gives you the Spirit. He does wonderful works among you. Does he do this because you obey the law? No, he does it because you heard the word of God and believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>So it was with Abraham. The holy writings say He believed God, and that was why God called him a good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>You see then, the people who believe God are children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>The holy writings say that he will put people right with himself if they believe him, even those who are not Jews. It was written down before God did it. The holy writings told the good news to Abraham ahead of time. It said, God will make you a blessing to all nations and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>Abraham believed God and was blessed. And so those who believe God are blessed too,  along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>A curse is on all people who are trying to become good by obeying the law. The holy writings say, Everyone is cursed who does not always obey everything that is written in the book of the law and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now, you can see this. No man is called a good man by God because he obeys the law.  The holy writings say, Those who are right with God shall live by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>The law does not ask people to believe. It says, He who obeys the laws will live because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has saved us from the curse which the law put on us. He took the curse on himself.  It should have been on us. The holy writings say, A curse be on everyone who hangs on a tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>Christ Jesus did this so that those who are not Jews will have the blessing which Abraham had. He did this so that when we believe, we will receive the Spirit who was promised to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>My brothers, it is the same as when a man makes a promise. He makes it good and strong. Then no one can break it or add anything to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>God made his promises to Abraham and to his Son. The promise does not have the words, and to his sons, for that means many sons. But it says, and to his Son, and that Son is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Here is what I mean. The law was given &lt;FI&gt;to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; four hundred and thirty years after God gave that promise to Abraham. But it cannot break the strong promise which God made. And the law cannot change Gods promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>Do we get what God has promised us by obeying the law? If we do, then we are not getting it by his promise. But God gave it to Abraham by his promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then was the law made? God gave it after he made the promise, because so many people were doing what was wrong. The law was to be in power only until the Son came,  the one to whom the promise was made. The law was handed down by Gods angels with the help of a middle man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>To need the help of a middle man there must be more than one person making the agreement. But God is the only one who made the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law against the promises of God? No, it is not! If a law had been given that could give people life, then surely people would have become good people by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the holy writings say it is like this. The whole world is in prison, kept there by the wrong things they have done. This was done so that people who believe in Jesus Christ would have the blessing. This blessing was promised to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>Before one came for us to believe in, the law held us in prison like slaves. We were kept there until the one to believe in should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>The law watched over us, as if we were children, until Christ came. Then God would put us right with himself through faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now that one has come for us to believe in, the law does not watch over us any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>You are all Gods children because you have believed in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>All of you who have been baptised into Christ have taken Christ as your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is no longer any difference between a Jew and one who is not a Jew; between a slave and a free man; between a man and a woman. When you are in the body of Christ Jesus, you are all alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>If you belong to Christ, you are Abrahams children. And if you are Abrahams children,  you will receive the blessing that God has promised.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Here is what I mean. When a man dies, his son is to receive his property. As long as the son is not grown up, he cannot have it. He has no more right than a servant, even though he really owns all the property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>He still has people who take care of him and he must obey them until the time set by his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So it is with us. Before we were grown up, we were like servants. We were just beginning to learn about the things of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the right time came, God sent his Son to make us free. He was born by a woman during the time when men had to obey the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>God sent him to set the people free who were under the law. God sent him so that we would receive our rights as sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. The Spirit calls out, Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So then, because of what God has done, you are no longer a slave but you are a son. And because you are a son, you will receive what he promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>At first, you did not know God. At that time you obeyed things which are not real gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now you know God. That is, God knows you. Then why do you turn to things that are weak and can do no good? Do you want to obey them again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You have holy days, holy months, holy seasons, and holy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I fear that all my work for you has been for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>My brothers, I beg you, be like me because I am like you. You did me no wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know that I was sick when I first told you the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>My sickness troubled you. But you did not think wrongly of me or turn away from me.  You received me as if I were an angel from God, as if I were Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Why are you not happy any more? I saw myself that you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if you could do such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Do you hate me because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>Other people are trying hard to get you on their side. But they do not mean to help you.  They want to get you away from Christ so that you will listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>Of course, it is good if someone tries to help you, but only if it is for a good reason. It is always good, not only when I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My dear children, I feel pain for you again, like a mother when her child is being born. I will feel pain until Christ lives in your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I wish I could be with you now, and not have to talk this way. But I am troubled about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you people that want the law to control you, why do you not listen to the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>The holy writings say that Abraham had two sons. One was the son of the slave woman.  The other one was the son of the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>The child of the slave woman was born as any child is born. But the child of the free woman was born because God promised he would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>These things have another meaning. These two women are like two agreements. One agreement came from Mount Sinai. The children are born slaves. That agreement is like Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>So Hagar means Mount Sinai in the country of Arabia. She is like the city of Jerusalem today, because Jerusalem is a slave and her children are too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the city of Jerusalem in heaven is free, and that is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>The holy writings say, The woman who has not had a child, be happy! You who do not feel the pain of bearing a child, open your mouth and shout. The woman who is left alone has more children than the woman who has a husband!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>My brothers, we are like Isaac. We are born because God made a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>Abrahams child who was born as any child is born, troubled the other child who was born by the Spirit. It is that way today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the holy writings say? They says, Put away the slave woman and her son.  The son of the slave woman will have nothing when the father dies. The son of the free woman will have everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So, my brothers, we are not the children of the slave woman, but we are children of the free woman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Christ has made us really free. So, stay free! Do not let yourselves be made slaves again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>I, Paul, say to you again that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ is no help to you at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>Again I say to every man who is circumcised, he must obey all the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Some of you are trying to obey the law, so that God will call you good. If you do this,  you have been cut off from Christ. You have lost the blessing of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>But we hope to be made right by believing in Christ. The Spirit helps us to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>So if a man belongs to Christ Jesus, it does not matter if he is circumcised or not. He must show by his love that he believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were doing well. Who stopped you from doing what is right?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>God calls you but he is not the one who made you change your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>Even a little yeast makes all the bread rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>The Lord makes me sure that you will not think any other way. But the teacher who is troubling your minds will be punished. It does not matter who he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>My brothers, am I still telling people to be circumcised? If I am, why are people still troubling me? If it were true, the cross of Christ, which they do not like, has lost its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>These teachers are troubling your minds. How I wish they would cut themselves off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not take that to mean that you can do as you please. But work for each other because you love each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>This one law is the whole law: Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and chew each other, be careful, or you will be killed by each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>So I say, let the Spirit tell you what you should do. Then you will not do the wrong things you yourselves want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>People want to do wrong things that the Spirit does not want them to do. And the Spirit wants people to do things they do not want to do. The Spirit and the wrong things you want to do are against each other, so that you do not do what you yourself want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>If you do what the Spirit wants you to do, then you will be free from the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>It is easy to see the wrong things people want to do. Both married people and those who are not married commit adultery. People make themselves unclean because of their wrong use of sex. They do things they should be ashamed of doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>They worship idols. They use witch-power. They hate. They quarrel. They are jealous.  They get angry. They want their own way. They do not agree together and they join different groups against each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>They want what other people have. They even kill. They drink too much strong drink.  They like to take part in loud drinking and dancing. They do other things like these. I have told you before and I tell you again. Those who do these things will not be in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But these are the things which the Spirit wants you to show: love, joy, peace, patience,  being kind, being good, being true, being gentle, and keeping the body under control.  There is no law that says, These things are wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have stopped doing the wrong things they want to do.  They have stopped them just as if they were killed on a cross. And they have even stopped wanting to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>The Spirit gives us life. And so we should do what the Spirit wants us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>We must not be proud of ourselves. We must not make one another angry. We must not want what other people have.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>My brothers, perhaps a man has done something wrong. If so, you who are strong in the Spirit must help him to do the right thing again. Help him in a gentle way. Take care yourself, that you are not tried and will want to do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Help each other in your troubles. In that way you obey Christs law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>A man who thinks that he is an important person when he is not, that man fools himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>Let every man test his own work. Then he will be proud of his own work. He will not be proud because he thinks his own work is better than someone elses work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>Each man must carry his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>People are taught the word of God. They should give some of all the good things they have to those who teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be fooled about this. God cannot be fooled. A man gets what he plants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>The man who plants the wrong things he wants to do will get death, because of those wrong things. But the person who plants what the Spirit wants him to do will live for ever,  because of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>We must not get tired of doing good things. If we do not stop doing them, we will get something back when the right time comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, when we can, we should do good to all people. But most of all, we should do it to those who are in Gods family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>(See, I am writing this to you in big letters with my own hand.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>Some people want to do things that can be seen. They try to force you to be circumcised.  They want to hide from trouble which would come to them if they talk about the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>Even those who are circumcised do not obey the law. But they want you to be circumcised. Then they can be proud that they made you do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But I will not be proud of anything but of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of it, the things of the world have become dead to me, and I have become dead to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>It does not matter if a person is circumcised or not, but he must become a new person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>May all who live by this rule have peace. And may God bless them. They are the true people of Israel and they belong to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>From now on, please do not trouble me. For I have marks on my body that show I belong to the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>My brothers, may the kindness and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ bless your spirit. May he do it!</verse>
