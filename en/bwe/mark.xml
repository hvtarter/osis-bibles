        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, Gods Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>The men of God, called prophets, long ago wrote about it this way: God said, See, I send my man ahead of you to tell about you. He will make the way ready for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A man is calling out in the desert, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He told the people, Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee. John baptised him in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>As soon as he came up out of the water, Jesus saw the sky open. He saw Gods Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>A voice from the sky said, You are my dear Son. I am very pleased with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Right away, the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>Jesus was in the desert for forty days. All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong.  Jesus was with wild animals. Angels came and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>John was put in prison. Then Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news of Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>The time has come, he said. The kingdom of God is here. Stop your wrong ways, turn back to God and believe the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew.  They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I give you will be to catch people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Jesus called them. Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>They went to the town of Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath day, Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>He called out, Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>Jesus said to the spirit, Be quiet! Come out of him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>The bad spirit threw the man around. It called out loud and then it came out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>The people were all surprised. They said one to another, What is this? Is not this a new teaching? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they came out of the meeting house, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew. James and John went also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Simons wifes mother was sick and was lying down. She had a fever. Right away they told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>Jesus went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her right away,  and she began to do things to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>That evening when the sun went down, people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>All the people in the city crowded around the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He healed many sick people. He drove the bad spirits out of people. And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight. He went out to a place by himself.  There he talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Simon and his friends went out after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found him they said, Everyone is looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>Jesus said, We must go to the next towns. I must tell the good news to the people there too. That is why I came here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee. He also made the bad spirits come out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>A man who was sick with leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; came to him. He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Jesus was very sorry for him. He put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to.  Be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>As soon as he said this, the disease left the man and he was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>He said, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed. Give it to prove to people that you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him. Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>After a few days he came back to Capernaum. People soon heard that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>Many came together right away. The house was full. There was no more room, not even outside near the door. Jesus was telling them Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Four men brought a sick man to Jesus. The man could not move his arms or legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. They made a hole in the roof. Then they let down the mat with the sick man on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to the sick man, Son, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Some of the scribes were sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>They were thinking, Why does this man say such wrong things against God? He is not giving God respect! Who can forgive the wrong things people do? No one but God can do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus understood in his spirit what the scribes were thinking. He said right away, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the sick man, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven,"  or to say, "Get up. Take up your mat and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive the wrong things people do. So he said to the sick man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I tell you, get up! Take up your mat and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his mat and went home. They were all very much surprised, and they praised God. They said, We have never seen anything like this before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Jesus went out again by the seaside. Many people came to him. So he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. He was sitting at the place where people come to pay taxes. Jesus said to him, Come with me. Levi stood up and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Jesus was eating in Levis house. Many tax collectors and bad people also came. They sat down to eat with Jesus and his disciples. There were many who went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>The scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus ate with these people. They said to the disciples, Why does he eat and drink with bad people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus heard it. He said to them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him. I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Johns disciples and the Pharisees disciples were fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .  Some people came to Jesus and said, The disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast.  Why do your disciples not do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus answered them, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No person sews a piece of new cloth on an old coat. If he does, the new cloth will tear the old coat. Then the hole is bigger than it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No person puts new wine into old wine skins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins. Then the wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled. New wine is put into new skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath day. His disciples began to pick some of the seed (to eat) as they went along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to Jesus, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men who were with him were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>He went into Gods house when Abiathar was the high priest. Some bread was there for God. It was not right for them to eat it. Only the priests have the right to eat it. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the people who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>Jesus went on to say, The Sabbath was made for the good of man. Man was not made for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So the Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>Jesus went into the meeting house again. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>The Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Stand here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he spoke to the Pharisees. He said, Is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so they will live, or to let them die? But the Pharisees said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>Jesus was angry as he looked at them. And he was sad that their hearts were so hard.  Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so, and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out. Right away they and the servants of King Herod planned together how to kill Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>Jesus and his disciples went away to the sea of Galilee. Many people went with Jesus.  They came from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from the other side of the Jordan River. And many more people came also, a great many from around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. They also had heard about the great works that Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>Jesus saw that the crowd was very big. He told the disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would have more room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>He did this because he healed many people. All who were sick tried to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>When the bad spirits saw Jesus, they bowed down before him. They shouted, You are Gods Son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>He told them they must not tell anyone who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Then Jesus went up on the hill. He wanted some of the people to come with him. So he called them and they came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He chose twelve disciples to stay with him. He wanted to send them out to other places to tell people Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>He gave them power to heal people and to drive bad spirits out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>One of the twelve was Simon, whom Jesus called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>He also chose James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, whom he named Boanerges, which means "Men of Thunder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>He also chose Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon of Canan, and Judas Iscariot, the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him. Then Jesus and his disciples went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>So many people came again that they could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When Jesus family heard about this, they came to take him away. They said, He is crazy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The scribes who came from Jerusalem also talked about Jesus. They said, Beelzebub,  the chief of bad spirits, is in this man. He drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>Jesus called the people and talked to them in stories. He asked, How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If one part of a country fights against another part of the country, that country cannot be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>If one part of a family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>If Satan fights against himself and the bad spirits fight against each other, he cannot stand.  It will be the end of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>If anyone wants to go into a strong mans house and steal his things, he must first tie the strong man. Then he can steal his things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>I tell you the truth. All wrong things that people do and say about anyone will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But people who say wrong things against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. A person who does that will be punished for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Jesus said all this because the scribes said, A bad spirit is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Jesus mother and brothers came to him. They stood outside. They sent someone to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>Many people were sitting around him. They said, See, your mother and your brothers are outside. They want you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>Jesus asked them, Who are my mother and my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Then he looked at the people who sat around him. He said, These people are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Anyone who obeys God is my brother, my sister, and my mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Jesus began to teach people by the sea again. Many people came to him. So he got in a boat on the sea and sat down. The people were by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He told the people stories and taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>He said, Listen. A man went out to sow some seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much ground covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. So no seeds grew on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But some seed fell on good ground. That seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>Jesus said to them, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>Later, Jesus was alone. Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But we must use stories to tell the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>They may look and look, but they will not see. They may listen and listen, but they will not understand. If they did understand, they would turn back to God and he would forgive them for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>Jesus said also, Do you not understand this story? How then are you going to understand all the stories?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The man who sows the seed tells Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>Those beside the road are like people who hear the message. But as soon as they hear it,  Satan comes and takes it out of their hearts</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>The seed that fell on the stony ground is the same. It is like people who hear the message and as soon as they hear it they are very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>They believe it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, they stop believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>The seed that fell among the weeds is like people who hear the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and other things to be happy. These things push the message out of their hearts. No good comes from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>But some seed fell on good ground. That is like people who hear the message and understand it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that made thirty seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>Then Jesus said to them, People do not bring a light and put it under a basket or under a bed. But they put it on the place for a lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And Jesus said, Take care how you listen. How much you give to others is how much will be given to you. You who obey God will get more than you give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And Jesus said, The kingdom of God is like this. A man sows some seed in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>Then he goes on just as he did before. He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning.  The seed begins to grow but he doesnt know what makes it grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The ground itself makes the seed grow. First the plant comes up. Then it begins to have seed of its own. After a while the harvest is ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>When the harvest is really ready, he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And Jesus said, What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like this. A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant. It puts out very big branches. The birds come and live in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>Jesus told the people many stories like this. He told them as much of Gods words as they were able to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>He did not tell them anything without a story. When he was alone with his disciples, he told them the meaning of the stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>In the evening of that day, Jesus said to his disciples, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>The disciples left the people and took Jesus away in the boat he was in. Other little boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>A very strong wind began to blow. Water came in the boat. It began to fill up with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>Jesus was in the back end of the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The disciples woke him up. Master, they shouted. We will die! Do you not care?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>Then Jesus got up. He said to the wind and the sea, Stop! The wind stopped. Then all was quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>Then he said to the disciples, Why do you fear? Do you not believe in God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>The disciples were surprised. They said to each other, What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>There were graves in that place. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man came from among the graves to meet him. The man had a bad spirit in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>The man lived among the graves. No person could tie him, not even with chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Many times people had tied him with strong ropes and chains. But he broke the chains and tore the ropes into many pieces. No person was strong enough to hold the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>All the time he stayed in the hills where the graves were. He screamed day and night and cut himself with sharp stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>Jesus was still far from him, but when he saw Jesus he ran to him. He kneeled down in front of Jesus and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the High God, what are you going to do to me? I beg you not to hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>He said this because Jesus had said to him, You bad spirit, come out of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Jesus asked, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>He begged Jesus saying, Do not send us out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Many pigs were feeding on the hill there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>The bad spirits begged Jesus saying, Send us to the pigs so that we can go into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>Jesus let them go right away. The bad spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs.  The pigs ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water. The number of pigs was about two thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Then the men who cared for the pigs ran away. They told the people in the city and all around the country about it. The people went out to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>They came to Jesus. They saw the man who had the many bad spirits in him. He was sitting with clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Those who had seen it told them what had happened to the man who used to have many bad spirits. And they told about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then the people began to beg Jesus to go away out of their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>So Jesus got into the boat again. The man who used to have the bad spirits in him begged to go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus did not let him. He said, Go home. Tell your friends what the Lord has done for you. Tell them that he has helped you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So the man went away and told people in the Ten Towns what Jesus had done for him.  All the people were surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Jesus crossed over the sea again to the other side. Many people came to him while he was near the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>One of the rulers of the meeting house came to him. His name was Jairus. When he saw Jesus, he kneeled down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>He said, My little daughter is dying. I beg you, come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>So Jesus went with Jairus. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>Many doctors tried to heal her. She spent all the money she had to pay them. She was not better, but was getting worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind him. Then she reached out and touched his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>She said to herself, If only I touch his clothes, I will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>The bleeding stopped right away. She could feel that she was healed of her trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Jesus knew right away that power to heal went out from him. He turned around among the people and said, Who touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>But his disciples said to him, You see all these people pushing around you. Why do you ask, "Who touched me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>He looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>The woman was afraid and trembled. She knew what had happened to her. She kneeled down in front of Jesus and told him the truth about herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled. You are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While Jesus was still talking, some people came from the rulers house. They said, Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>Jesus heard it. He said to the ruler, Do not fear. Only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>Jesus did not let anyone go with him only Peter, James, and his brother John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>They came to the rulers house. Jesus saw that there was trouble. People were crying and making much noise because the rulers daughter had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>When he came into the house, he said to them, Why do you make so much noise and cry? The girl is not dead, but is sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>They laughed at him. So he sent them all outside. Then he took the girls father and mother and the three disciples into the room where the girl was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>He took her hand and said, Talitha cumi! That means, Little girl, I tell you, get up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>The girl got up right away and walked around. She was twelve years old. The people were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>Jesus said, Do not tell anyone about this. Give the girl something to eat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Jesus left that place and went back to his home town. His disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>On the Sabbath day he began to teach in the meeting house again. Many people who heard him were very much surprised and said, Where did he learn all this? Where did he get the power to do these big works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is he not the carpenter? Is not Mary his mother? Are not James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon his brothers? Are not his sisters here with us? The people did not understand Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>Jesus said to them, Other people honour a man who is a prophet of God. But the people in his own country, his own home, and his family, do not honour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>Jesus could not do any big works in that place. But he put his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He was surprised that the people did not believe him. He went out to the villages,  teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He called the twelve disciples to him and sent them out two by two. He gave them power to drive bad spirits out of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He said, Take only a walking stick with you when you go. Do not take anything else. Do not take any food, or a bag, or money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>Wear shoes, but do not take extra clothing with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>When you go into a certain house, live there until you leave the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>In some places the people will not take you in. They will not listen to what you say.  When you leave such a town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a warning to them. I tell you the truth. On the day when people are judged, the people in that town will be punished harder than the people in the country of Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>The disciples went out and told the people that they should stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They drove bad spirits out of many people. They also put oil on many sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard about these things. People were talking about Jesus everywhere.  Herod said, John the Baptizer is risen from death. That is why he is able to do such great works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Other people said, It is Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet like the prophets of God who lived long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>Herod heard what other people said, so he said, I cut off Johns head. He is alive again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>Herod had sent his people to catch John. They tied him and put him in prison to please Herodias. Herod had married her, but she was his brother Philips wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>John had told Herod, It is wrong for you to have your brothers wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>So Herodias hated John. She wanted to kill him. But she could not because Herod liked John. He knew that John did what was right and was a good man. So he kept John safe.  When he heard John speak he was troubled in his heart, and yet he was glad to hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>rod made a feast on his birthday. He called all his rulers and the captains and the leaders of Galilee to come to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them. This pleased Herod and the people at the feast. Then the king said to the girl, Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He made a promise which he would not break. He said, Anything that you ask me for I will give you, even if you ask me for half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>The girl went to her mother and said, What shall I ask for? Her mother said, Ask for the head of John the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>The girl came quickly to the king and said, I want you to give me the head of John the Baptizer on a plate. Give it to me right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>The king was very sorry. But he had made a promise and all the people at the feast had heard him promise. He wanted to do what he promised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>Right away he sent one of the soldiers who was standing on guard. He told him to bring Johns head. The soldier went to the prison and cut off Johns head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>He brought the head on a plate and gave it to the girl. She gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When Johns disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and buried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles came back to Jesus. They told him all they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>Jesus said to them, Come away with me. Let us go alone to a quiet place and rest for a while. Many people were coming and going. They could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they went away in a boat to a lonely place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>The people saw them going. Many people knew them. The people ran from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When the boat got there, Jesus saw the many people. He was very sorry for them because they were like sheep with no one to care for them. He began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him. They said, This is a lonely place and the time is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send these people away to farms and villages to buy food for themselves. They have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>Jesus said, You give them food to eat. They said, Shall we go and buy a lot of bread and give them to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said, Go and see how much bread you have. When they knew, they told him, We have five loaves of bread and two fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Jesus told the disciples to make all the people sit on the green grass in groups.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>The people sat down in groups. Some groups were a hundred people and some were fifty people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke them in pieces. He gave them to the disciples to give to the people. Then he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>They all ate and had enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>Then they gathered twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>The number of men who ate was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Then Jesus said to the disciples, You get into the boat right away and go over to Bethsaida. I will send the people away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>When he had sent the people away, he went up on the hill to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>In the evening the boat was far out on the water. Jesus was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>He saw the disciples working hard rowing the boat. The wind was blowing the wrong way. When it was almost morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He was walking on the water. He was going to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought it was a spirit. They shouted loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>They all saw him and were very much afraid. He spoke to them right away. He said, Be glad! It is I. Do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he got in the boat with them. The wind stopped. They were very much surprised and did not know what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>They did not understand the lesson about the bread because their minds were too slow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>They crossed over the sea and came to the land at Gennesaret. They came to shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>As soon as he got out of the boat, the people knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They went quickly to all the country around. They brought sick people in their beds to the place where they heard Jesus was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>They laid sick people by the road in villages, towns, and farms and every place he went.  They begged him to let them touch his clothes. And all the people who touched him were healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They saw some of the disciples eating food. They had not washed their hands before they ate. The Pharisees said that was wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>They and all the Jews keep the laws made by men. God did not give them those laws.  They do not eat until they wash their hands very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>When they come from the market, they do not eat until they have washed themselves.  They also keep many other laws such as washing cups, pots, brass pans, and beds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, Why do your disciples not keep the law our fathers made? Why do they eat with hands that are not clean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>Jesus said to them, Isaiah spoke the truth about you people! You are not true to yourselves! He wrote about you this way: "These people respect me with their mouths.  But their hearts are far from me. They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me. Their teachings are only words of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>You do not keep the law of God, but you keep the laws made by people. Those laws are about washing pots and cups. You do many other things like that also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>The disciples talked to one another about the matter. They said, He says that because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Jesus knew what they were saying. He asked, Why are you saying, "We have no bread"? Do you not yet understand? Are your minds so slow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Can you not see with your eyes or hear with your ears? Do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke five loaves for five thousand people, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather? They said, Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>He said, When I broke seven loaves for four thousand people, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you gather? They said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He said to them, How is it that you do not yet understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>Then they came to Bethsaida. Some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged him to touch the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spat on his eyes and put his hands on him. Then he asked, Do you see anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>The man looked up and said, I see men, but they look like trees that are walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Jesus put his hands on him again. He made him look up. Then he was healed and could see everybody clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Jesus sent the man away to his home. Do not go into the village and do not tell it to anyone, he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Jesus went with his disciples to the villages in Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, Who do people say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They answered, People say that you are John the Baptizer. Others say that you are Elijah. And others say that you are one of the prophets from long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Then he asked them, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>Then he began to teach them. He said, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. After three days he will rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>Jesus said this very plainly. Peter took him to one side and began to tell him not to say such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>Jesus turned around and saw the disciples. Then he talked to Peter. He said, Get away from me, Satan! You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Jesus called the people and the disciples to him. He said, If anyone wants to come with me he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be ready to carry his own cross and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake and for the sake of the good news will find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>What can a person give to get back his soul? People have gone away from God and are full of wrong ways. If anyone in this time is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of Man will come with his holy angels, and be great like his Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God come with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days after this, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him. He led them up a hill by themselves. Jesus was changed in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His clothes were white like light. No person on earth could make them so white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Then they saw Elijah and Moses talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter said to Jesus, Master, this is a good place for us. We will make three places,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>Peter did not know what to say because they were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then a cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>They quickly looked around but they saw no one except Jesus there with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>So they kept these things to themselves, asking each other what he meant about rising from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>Then they asked Jesus, Why do the scribes &lt;FI&gt;who know all about the holy writings&lt;Fi&gt; say that first Elijah must come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said, Elijah does come first. He will get everything ready. But why do the holy writings say that the Son of Man must have much trouble? They say, "He will have much trouble and the people will not respect him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>I tell you that Elijah has come. The people did to him just what they wanted to do. They did just as it is written about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When they came to the disciples, they saw many people around them. Some scribes were talking with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>The people were all very much surprised when they saw Jesus. They ran to him and greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>Jesus asked his disciples, What are you talking about with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>One of the people said, Teacher, I brought my son to you. A bad spirit is in him so he cannot talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>Wherever it takes hold of him, it throws him around. It makes him foam at his mouth. It makes him make noises with his teeth. He is getting weak and thin. I asked your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>So they brought the boy to him. As soon as the bad spirit saw him, he threw the boy around. The boy fell on the ground and rolled around. Foam was coming from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Jesus asked the father, How long has he had this spirit? He answered, Since he was a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>Often it has thrown him in the fire and in the water. It has tried to kill him. If you can do anything for him, show us that you share our suffering by helping us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him, You say, "If you can." Anything can be done for the person who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Right away the father of the child, with tears in his eyes, said loudly, I do believe! Help me to believe more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>Jesus saw many people come running together. He talked to the bad spirit: You bad spirit who stops the boy from hearing and talking! I tell you, come out of him and do not go into him again!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>The bad spirit screamed and threw the boy around. Then it came out of him and left him like a dead person. Many of the people even said, The boy is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took his hand and helped him to get up. The boy stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>Jesus went into the house. His disciples were alone with him. They asked him, Why could we not drive out the bad spirit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>Jesus said to them, This kind of bad spirit does not come out unless people talk to God and fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Then they left that place and went through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>He taught his disciples. He said to them, The Son of Man will be given over to men.  They will kill him. When he is killed, he will rise after three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>The disciples did not understand what he said and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked the disciples, What were you talking about on the way coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they said nothing, because on the road they had been talking among themselves about who was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>He sat down and called the twelve disciples to him. He said, The way to be first is to put yourself last and be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>Jesus took a child and had him stand in front of them. Then he took the child in his arms and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. If anyone takes in me, he takes in the One who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John said to him, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name, but he is not one of us. So we told him to stop because he is not one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who can do a great work in my name will not be quick to say wrong things about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>He that is not against us is on our side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>I tell you the truth. If anyone gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, he will not lose his reward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand makes you do wrong, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life with one hand than to have two hands and go into hell. Hell fire never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>If your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life with one foot than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. Hell fire never dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>If your eye makes you do wrong, take it out. It is better for you to go into Gods kingdom with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>In hell their worm will not die and the fire will not stop burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>Everyone must be tested by fire. Every sacrifice must have salt on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>Salt is good. But if the salt has lost its taste, how can it be made salty again? You must have salt in yourselves and live in peace with one another.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Jesus left that place and went through the country of Judea on the other side of the Jordan river. Many people came to him there again. He taught them as he always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>The Pharisees came to him and asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him? They asked this to test Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>Jesus answered, What law did Moses give you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said, Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>From the time God first made people, he made them man and woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.8'>The two of them will be like one person. So they are not two people any more, but they are one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>Man must not separate what God has joined together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>When they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>So Jesus said, If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery against her. &lt;FI&gt;He takes another woman who is not his wife.&lt;Fi&gt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>They brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>When Jesus saw what the disciples did, he did not like it. He said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>Jesus took the children up in his arms. He put his hands on them and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>Jesus started on the way again. A man came running and kneeled down before him. He said, Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>Jesus said, Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the laws: "Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.  Do not cheat. Respect your father and your mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>The man answered Jesus. He said, Teacher, I have kept all those laws since I was a boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Jesus looked at him. He loved him. He said, You need one thing more. Go home. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor people. You will be rich in heaven. So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Then Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them, It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were surprised at his words. But Jesus said again, Children, it is very hard for people who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>It is easier for a big animal to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>They were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it but God can, because God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter began to speak and said to him, See, we have left all things and have come with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.29'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.30'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If any man has left his house, or his brothers, or his sisters, his mother, or his father, or his children, or farms, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, he will receive his pay in this life. He will have a hundred times as many houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and farms. He will have trouble also. But in the next world he will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.31'>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>Jesus and his disciples were on the road to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking in front of them.  The disciples were surprised. And the people who came behind were afraid. He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>He said, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will judge him and say he must die. They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.34'>They will make fun of him. They will spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. After three days, he will rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, Master, we want you to do for us anything we ask you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>They said, Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>Yes, they said. We can. Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left. It has been planned who will sit there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>Jesus called them and said, You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great will tell the others what to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, many people followed him. A blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. He was begging for money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing. So he shouted, Jesus, Son of David! Help me!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>The disciples said what Jesus had told them to say. So they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. He got on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.8'>Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut leaves and branches from the fields and put them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.9'>People in front of him and people behind him shouted, Praise God! God bless him who comes in the name of the Lord!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>And so Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. He looked at everything. Then he went out with the twelve disciples to Bethany. It was late already.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>He saw a fig tree a little way off with leaves on it. So he went to see if it had figs. He came to the tree. There was no fruit on it, only leaves. It was not the time for figs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>They reached Jerusalem. Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple. He threw down the tables of the money changers. He pushed down the seats of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>He would not let anyone carry anything through the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>He taught the people, saying, The holy writings say, "My house shall be called a house for all tribes and nations, where people talk with God." But you have made it a place for people who steal!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>The chief priests and scribes heard what he said. They wanted to find some way to kill him. They feared Jesus because all the people were surprised at his teaching.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>The next morning they passed the fig tree again. They saw that it had died from the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>Peter remembered about it. He said, Look Master, you cursed the fig tree and it has died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>Jesus said, Believe in God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.30'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men? Answer me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>So they talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>But what if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it"? They feared the people because they all believed that John was a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know. Then Jesus said, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.12'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Jesus then began to speak to the disciples in stories. A man planted a farm of vines for growing fruit called grapes. He put a fence of small trees around it. He dug a place to press the juice from the fruit. He built a high house from which men could watch over the farm. Then he let some men pay to use it and went to a country far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>At harvest time the owner sent one his servants to get some of the fruit from the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>The men took the servant and beat him. They sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>He sent another servant. They hurt this one also, and cut his head. The things they did to him were very wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>So he sent another servant. The men killed him. He sent many others, and the men beat some and killed others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>There was one left. He was his own son. He sent him last. He said, "They will respect my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But the men said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>They killed him and threw his body outside the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What will the man who owned the farm do to them? He will come back and kill the men in the farm. And he will give the farm to other men to use.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not read this writing: "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief stone of the corner. The Lord did this. It looks wonderful to us."?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They tried to catch Jesus but they feared the people. They knew that Jesus had spoken this against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>They sent some Pharisees and some of Herods people to Jesus. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>They came and said to him, Teacher, we know that you are true. You do not fear any person or care how great he is. But you teach the true way of God. Tell us, is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we pay taxes or not? Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? Bring me a piece of money.  Let me look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>They brought one to him. He asked, Whose picture and name is this? They answered,  Caesars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>So he said, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give to God what belongs to God.  The Pharisees and Herods people were much surprised at Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death. They asked Jesus a question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: if a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>e second brother married the wife. He also died and left no child. It was the same with the third one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>All seven brothers married her. They all had no children. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>Now then when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>People do rise from death! Have you never read what Moses wrote? It is in the place where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses tells how God said to him, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. The way you look at things is wrong altogether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>One of the scribes heard them talking. He saw that Jesus gave them a good answer. Then he came and asked, Which law is the greatest law of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, The greatest one is, "Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your mind. And love him with all your strength."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second law is this: "Love your neighbour as you love yourself." No law is greater than these laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>Then the scribe answered Jesus, Teacher, what you say is right. There is one God.  There are no other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>Love God with all your heart. Love him with all your understanding. Love him with all your strength. That is much better than to burn offerings and make sacrifices. Love your neighbour as you love yourself. That is better than any of these offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jesus saw that the scribe was wise. So he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. After that everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Jesus was teaching people in the temple. He said, How can the scribes say that Christ is Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>The Holy Spirit spoke through David and he himself said: "The LORD said to my Lord,  Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son? Most of the people were glad to hear Jesus teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>Jesus went on to teach them. He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you by the way they do things. They like to walk about with long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>They want to sit in the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up the wrong things they do by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Jesus sat down in the temple near the place where people put in their money. He saw how the people put in money. Many rich people put in much money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>A poor woman, whose husband was dead, came. She put in two small pieces of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>Jesus called his disciples. He said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more money than all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>When Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said, Look Master, see those big stones and the wonderful houses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>Jesus said, You see these big houses? I tell you, not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>Afterwards, he was sitting on the hill called the Mount of Olives, near the temple. Peter,  James, John, and Andrew came to him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>They said, Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign when these things are going to be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>Then Jesus began to talk to them. He said, Take care. Do not let anyone fool you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>Many men will come in my name. They will say, "I am Christ." They will fool many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>You will hear about wars. You will hear that war is coming. But do not fear. These things must happen, but that is not yet the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>One tribe will fight against another tribe. And one country will fight against another country. The earth will shake in many different places. People will have no food to eat.  These troubles are only the beginning of the troubles that will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But you must take care. Men will take you to court. They will beat you in their meeting houses. They will take you to rulers and kings because you are true to me. You will talk to them about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>The good news must first be told to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>When men take you to court, do not be troubled about what you will say. Say whatever comes to your mind at that time. It is not you who speak, but it is the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>A brother will take his brother to be killed. A father will take his child. The children will talk against their father and mother and have them killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>All people will hate you because you are true to me. But the person who keeps on being true to me until the end will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>Daniel the Man of God said that people would put something very bad in the temple.  (Let the one who reads this understand it.) When that happens, the people in Judea must go quickly to the hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.15'>A person who is on the top of a house must not go down into the house to get things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.16'>Those who are working in the fields must not go back to get their coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.17'>In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child. It will be very hard for mothers who have babies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.18'>Ask God that you may not have the trouble in the cold time of the year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.19'>The trouble then will be bigger than any trouble since God made the world. And there never will be any trouble as big as that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.20'>No person would be saved if the Lord did not make the time of trouble shorter. He will make it shorter for the sake of his chosen people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.21'>If anyone says to you then, "Look, here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" do not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.22'>People will come and say they are the Christ. People will come and say they are prophets of God. But they are not true to themselves. They will show big signs and do wonderful things that will fool people. They will fool Gods chosen people if they can.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.31'>The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.32'>But no one knows the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Even the angels in heaven and the Son do not know. Only the Father knows.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>The Passover Feast and the feast with bread that has no yeast in it was two days later.  The chief priests and the scribes planned how to catch Jesus by some trick. They wanted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in Simons house. Simon had leprosy.  While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She broke the bottle and poured the oil on Jesus head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some people there were angry. They said, Why was this oil wasted like that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>The oil might have been sold for a lot of money. Then the money could have been given to poor people. They said to the woman, You should not have done this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, Leave the woman alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good thing to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>You will always have poor people with you. Any time you want to, you can do good to them. But I will not always be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>They were glad when they heard that. They promised to give him money. So he watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast. His disciples asked Jesus Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>He sent two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the city. There you will meet a man who is carrying a pot of water. Follow him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>The Son of Man will go just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to them. They all drank some of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! They all said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus said to his disciples, Sit here. I will go and talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>He took Peter, James, and John along with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>Jesus went on a little farther. He fell on the ground and asked God that, if it could be so,  this big trouble might pass by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>He said, Oh, my Father, you can do all things. Take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want, but what you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Jesus went back and found the disciples sleeping. He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>All of you must watch and talk with God so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>What he has said is wrong! What do you think? They all said, He should be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Some people began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him. They laughed at him and said, Tell us if you know who hit you! The guards took him away and hit him as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl who worked for the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>She saw Peter warming himself by the fire. She looked at him and said, You were also with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But Peter said, I do not know or understand what you are talking about. Peter went out to the gate. Then a cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>A girl saw Peter there and said to the other people standing by, This man is one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again Peter said he was not. A little while after, those standing around said to Peter,  Surely you are one of them also. You come from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then Peter began to curse and say bad words. He said, I do not know this man you are talking about!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>Right then the cock called a second time and Peter remembered that Jesus had said,  Before the cock calls two times, you will say three times that you do not know me.  Then he broke down and cried.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>As soon as it was morning, the chief priests, leaders, and the scribes talked together.  They tied Jesus and took him before Pilate to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus answered, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>The chief priests brought many complaints against Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Then Pilate asked him, Have you nothing to say? These people are bringing many complaints against you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus said nothing. Pilate was very much surprised about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>At the feast Pilate used to let one prisoner free. He let the people choose the man they wanted to go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>In the prison was a man named Barabbas. He had led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>He knew that the chief priests did not like Jesus. He knew that was why they brought Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests talked to the people. They told them to ask Pilate to let Barabbas go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>Pilate asked them, Then what shall I do with the man whom you call King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They shouted back, Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilate then asked, Why, what wrong thing has he done? But they shouted even more,  Nail him to a cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>Pilate wanted to please the people, so he let Barabbas go free. He told the soldiers to beat Jesus and nail him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers took Jesus to a room. They called all the soldiers together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>They put a red gown on Jesus. They made a big ring of thorns like a crown and put it on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>Then they began to speak to him as if he were a king. They shouted, Greetings, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>They hit him on the head with a stick and spat on him. They kneeled down before him as if to give him great respect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>When they had made fun of him, they took off the red gown and put his own clothes on him again. Then they took Jesus out of the city to nail him to a cross.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>They wanted Jesus to drink wine mixed with something bitter. But Jesus would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>Then they nailed him to a cross. They gambled to see how they should divide Jesus  clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was nine oclock in the morning when they nailed him on the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>They put the complaint they had against him above Jesus head. It was, The King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>They also nailed two bad men on crosses there. One was put on the right side of Jesus and one was put on the left side of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>The holy writings say, He was counted as one of the bad people. It came true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>The people who passed by said wrong things about him. They shook their heads and said, Ha, ha! You are the man who said you could break down the temple and build it again in three days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>The chief priests and the scribes also made fun of him. He saved other people, but he cannot save himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>If he is the Christ, the king of the people of Israel, he should come down from the cross now. We want to see it and believe! The bad men who were also nailed to crosses said the same things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>About midday the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>About three oclock, Jesus called out loud, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? That means,  My God, my God, why have you left me alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some of the people standing there heard what Jesus said. They said, Listen, he is calling for Elijah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>One man ran to get something called a sponge. He made it wet with sour wine and put it on the end of a stick. With it he gave Jesus a drink. He said, We will see if Elijah will come and take him down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>Then Jesus called out loud. Then he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces. It was torn from the top down to the bottom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>It was now evening of the day before the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea was a member of the court. He was a good man. He also was looking for the kingdom of God. He was not afraid, but went to Pilate and asked him for Jesus body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was dead already. He called the captain and asked him if Jesus was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>The captain told him that he was. Then Pilate let Joseph take the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>Joseph went to buy some cloth. Then he took Jesus down and wrapped him in the cloth.  He laid him in a grave that had been cut in a rock. Then he rolled a very big stone to close the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where they laid Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>The Sabbath day was past. Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome came to the grave. They brought spices that smelled very nice to put on the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>They came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was very early in the morning.  The sun was beginning to shine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>One woman said to the other, Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>The stone was very big. When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>So they went in the grave. They saw a young man dressed in a white gown. He sat at the right side. They were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>He said, Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross. He is risen. He is not here. Look, here is where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>Go and tell his disciples and Peter. Tell them he is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there as he said to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>Then they left the grave quickly. They were trembling and afraid. They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Jesus rose early on the first day of the week. He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told the disciples that she had seen him. They were still crying because Jesus was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>Mary told them that he was living. She had seen him. But they would not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this, Jesus came to two disciples. He looked like a different person. They were walking out in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>They went back and told the rest of the disciples, but they would not believe them either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow. He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>Then Jesus said to them, Go into every part of the world. Tell the good news to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved. But he who does not believe will be judged and punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>These signs will be with those who believe. They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name. They will speak new languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They will take up snakes. If they drink poison, it will not make them sick. They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them, he went up into heaven and sat down beside God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked.</verse>
