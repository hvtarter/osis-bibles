        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Many people have tried already to write down the things that have happened among us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>These things were told us by men who saw them happen from the time they began to happen. And these men helped tell the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>I have tried to find out all that has happened from the beginning. And so, Theophilus,  great ruler, I myself will write you the whole story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>Then you will know that the things people have told you are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He was one of a group of priests, and Abijah was their leader. Zechariahs wife Elizabeth came from the family of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>Both of them were good people as God saw them. They obeyed all the laws and the things that the Lord said they should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no children. Elizabeth was not able to have a baby and they were both very old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Zechariah was doing his work one day as a priest to God. It was time for his group to do the work in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>The priests had a certain way of dividing their work. This day it was Zechariahs turn to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense &lt;FI&gt;that smells sweet when it is burned&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>All the people were talking to God outside the temple at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>An angel of the Lord came to Zechariah. He was standing on the right side of the incense table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>When Zechariah saw him, he was surprised and afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said, Do not be afraid, Zechariah. You have been talking to God. He has heard you. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son. Name him John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>You will be glad and happy. Many people will be glad when he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>He will be great in the way the Lord calls people great. He must not drink wine or any strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will go ahead of the Lord. He will have the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children. And he will bring back the people who do not obey,  so that they will want to do what good people do. He will make people ready for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Then Zechariah said to the angel, How can I know that this will happen? I am an old man and my wife is also old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered him, I am Gabriel and I stand before God. I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>Now listen. You will be silent and not be able to talk until the day that all this has happened. This is because you did not believe what I told you. At the right time all that I said will come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple. They were surprised that he stayed in so long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When he came out, he could not talk to them. They knew that he had seen something in the temple. He made signs to them with his hands and did not talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When his time for doing the work of a priest was finished, Zechariah went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After that, his wife Elizabeth found she was going to have a baby. For five months she stayed away from people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>She said to herself, The Lord has done this for me. At this time he has remembered me so that I need not be ashamed among people anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Elizabeth was now in her sixth month. God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>The angel was sent to a young woman there. Her name was Mary. She was promised to a man named Joseph, to be his wife. He was of Davids family line.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel went into the house and said to her, Be happy! God has blessed you more than other women. The Lord is with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>What the angel said troubled Mary. She wondered what this greeting meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary. God has blessed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>You will have a baby son. Name him Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be a great man. He will be called the Son of the Highest One &lt;FI&gt;a name for God&lt;Fi&gt; .  The Lord God will make him king where his father David was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>He will be king over the people of Israel for ever. He will never stop being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this happen? I have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come to you. The power of the Highest One will be over you. That is why the holy child who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>Your cousin Elizabeth is also going to have a baby son, though she is an old woman.  This is the sixth month for her. She is one whom people said would not have a baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>But God can do anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Mary said, I am the Lords servant. Let it be as you have said. Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>At that time, Mary got ready and went as quickly as she could to the hill country. She went to a town in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the baby in her moved. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>She said in a loud voice, God has made you happy and blessed you more than all other women. He has blessed your baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>Listen! When I heard your greeting, the baby inside me moved because he was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>She who has believed what was told her is blessed. What the Lord said to her will come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Mary said, My heart is praising the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit is happy because God has saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>He has remembered his servant even though she is not a great person. From now on all people of all times will say God has blessed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>He who has all power has done a big work for me. His name is holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>He is kind to people of all times who respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown how strong he is with his arm. He has taken away people who were proud in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has moved big rulers from power, and those that were not great he has made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has given hungry people good things to eat, and sent away the rich people with nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped his servant Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>He has remembered to be kind just as he said to our fathers of long ago. He promised to be kind to Abraham and his childrens children for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months. Then she went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>The time had now come for Elizabeths child to be born. She had a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>When her neighbours and family heard that the Lord had been so kind to her, they were glad, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day people came to circumcise &lt;FI&gt;make a special mark on&lt;Fi&gt; the child. They were going to name him Zechariah like his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>But his mother said, No, his name is to be John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, But no one in your family has that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They made signs to the father to find out what name he wanted the child to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for something to write on. He wrote, His name is John. They were all surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Right then he opened his mouth and his tongue was free. He began to speak and to praise God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Everyone who lived around there began to wonder at these things. And everywhere in the hill country of Judea, all these things were talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All those who heard them thought much about them. They said, What will this child be some day? They said this because the power of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>He said, Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has remembered his people, and set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>He has chosen one from the family of his servant David. He has given him power to save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>That is what he promised through his holy prophets of God long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>He said he would save us from our enemies and set us free from those who hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>He said he would be kind to our fathers. He said he would remember his agreement with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>That was what he promised our father Abraham he would surely do. He promised to set us free from our enemies. He promised that we should be without fear. He promised that we would worship him and be holy and good before him as long as we live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>You, my child, will be called the prophet or messenger of the Highest One. You will go ahead of the Lord to make his way ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>You will tell his people how to be saved by being forgiven for their wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Our God is kind. A light from heaven will shine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>That light will shine on those who are in darkness, and are going to die. That light will show us how to walk in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew. He became strong in spirit. He lived in the desert until the day when he came to the people of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>About that time, Augustus the Roman ruler made a law. All the people in the world must have their names written down in a book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first time names were written in a book in this way. Quirinius was the ruler of Syria at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>Everyone went to his home town to have his name written in the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea. This was Davids town, and Joseph came from Davids family line.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>He went to have his name written in the book. Joseph took Mary with him. She was promised to Joseph to be his wife. She was going to have a baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>This was her first child, a son. She wrapped him in a cloth and laid him in a box where cows feed. There was no room for them in the house for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>In the same part of the country, men were taking care of sheep. They were in the field watching their sheep at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>An angel of the Lord came to them and a bright light from the Lord shone all around them. They were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>The angel said to them, Fear not! Listen, I bring you good news! This news will make you very glad. It is for all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>A saviour has been born for you today in Davids town. He is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>This is the way you will know him. You will find a baby wrapped in a cloth, lying in a box where cows feed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>All at once a great number of angels from heaven were with the angel. They were praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>They said, Praise God in the highest heaven! Peace on earth and loving mercy towards all people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>The angels left them and went back to heaven. The men who were taking care of the sheep said to one another Let us go to Bethlehem and see what has happened. It is the Lord who has told us about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>They went quickly. They found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the box where cows feed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they saw the child, they told what the angel had said to them about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All those who heard them were surprised at what the shepherds had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>Mary remembered all these things and kept thinking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the men who were taking care of the sheep went back. They praised and thanked God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as they had been told it would be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When the child was eight days old, it was time to circumcise him. They named him Jesus.  That was the name the angel gave him before the baby began to grow inside Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>The time came when Mary was no longer unclean by the law of Moses. Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem to bring him to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>This is what is written in the law of the Lord: Every boy who is the first child of his mother will be holy for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>They also came to make a sacrifice as an offering to God. The law of the Lord said, A pair of doves or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>A man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. He was a good man and he loved God. He was watching and waiting for the one who would save Israel. The Holy Spirit was on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>The Holy Spirit had shown him that he would not die before he had seen the Lords Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>He came into the temple, led by the Spirit. The parents brought in the child Jesus to do what the law said they should do about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Then Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>He said, Lord, now you are letting your servant go in peace, just as you said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>I have seen with my own eyes the one you have sent to save people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>You have made this way for all peoples to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>He is a light which will shine for those who do not know God. He is the one who will bring praise to your people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>Joseph and Mary were surprised at the things Simeon said about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Simeon blessed them. He said to Mary, the mother of Jesus, He will be a sign that people do not believe in. He will make many people in Israel fall and rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(Yes, a long knife will cut your heart too.) What people think will be made known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Anna, a woman prophet of God, was there too. Her fathers name was Phanuel. She was of the tribe of Asher. She was very old. She had been married and lived with her husband for seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>Then her husband died. Now she had been alone for eighty-four years. She did not leave the temple, but worshipped day and night. She talked with God and fasted &lt;FI&gt;did not eat food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>While Simeon was talking to Mary, Anna also came along and thanked God. She talked about Jesus to all the people who were waiting for the one who would set Jerusalem free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>The parents did everything that the law of the Lord said they should do. Then they went back to Galilee to their own town, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>The child grew. He became strong and very wise. And God blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast &lt;FI&gt;a special time to thank God&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When Jesus was twelve years old, they went to Jerusalem for the feast as they always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>After the days of the feast were finished, they started home. But the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>They thought he was coming with the rest of the people. They travelled one day. Then they looked for him among their family and friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>But they did not find him. So they went back to Jerusalem and looked for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>On the third day they found him in the temple. He was sitting in front of the teachers of the law. He was listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All who heard him were surprised at what he knew and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>His parents were surprised when they saw him. His mother said to him, Son, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been looking for you. We have been very troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He said to them, Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I had to be in my Fathers house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>They did not understand what he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>He went with them back to Nazareth and obeyed them. But his mother remembered all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>Jesus grew and became wiser and taller. He pleased God and also people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Tiberius Caesar had been king for fifteen years. Pontius Pilate was the ruler of Judea.  Herod was the ruler of Galilee. Herods brother Philip was the ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis. Lysanias was the ruler of Abilene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas were high priests. At that time God spoke to John in the desert. John was the son of Zechariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>Then John went to all the country around the Jordan River. He told the people to stop doing wrong things, turn back to God and be baptised. And God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>Isaiah, the prophet of God, wrote about him long ago in his book: A man is calling out in the desert: "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled. Every big hill and every small hill will be cut down flat.  Crooked roads will be made into straight roads. Bad roads will be made into good roads.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>John answered them, Any man who has two shirts should give one to a man who has none. Any man who has food should do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Tax collectors also came to be baptised. They asked John, Sir, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>He said to them, Do not make people pay more money than you are told to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Some soldiers also asked him, What shall we do? He answered them Do not force people. Do not tell lies about people. Do not want more pay than you get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>The people were waiting to see what would happen. They were all asking about John.  They thought that he might be the Christ, the great king promised by God long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John said to them all, I baptise you with water. But another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings. He will baptise you with the Holy spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>He has a cleaning fan in his hand and will fan his grain very clean. He will put the grain into his storehouse. But he will burn the chaff in the fire that never goes out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>By these words and many other ways, he told the people the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>John told Herod the ruler that he had done wrong things. He told him he should not have his brothers wife, Herodias. He also told him about all the other wrong things he had done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit. He left the Jordan River, and the Spirit led him into the desert for forty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>The devil tried to make him do wrong. Jesus did not eat in those forty days. Then he was very hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, tell this stone to be changed into bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>The devil took Jesus to a high place where he could see all the countries of the world at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>He said to Jesus, I will give you the right to rule over all these countries. They will make you great. All this has been given to me. I can give it to anyone I want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>So, if you worship and give honour to me, all will be yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God and he is the only one you are to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>The devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He put him on a high part of the temple. He said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>And "They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>When the devil finished all his testing, he left him for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Jesus had the power of the Spirit when he went back to Galilee. People talked about him in all that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>He taught them in their meeting houses. All the people praised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>He went to Nazareth where he had grown up. He went to the meeting house as he always did on the Sabbath day. He stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>A man gave him the book that Isaiah the prophet of God wrote long ago. He opened the book and found the place where it says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he chose me to tell the good news to poor people. He has sent me to tell the prisoners they can go free, and to tell the blind people they can see. He has sent me to set free those who have been wrongly held down,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>and to tell people that the year when the Lord will help them has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>Then Jesus closed the book and gave it back to the man. He sat down. Everyone in the meeting house was watching him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>He began to talk to them. He said, You have heard what the holy writings say. They have come true today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>They all began to talk about him. They were surprised to hear him say such good words.  They asked, Is not this Josephs son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>Then Jesus said, I know that you will say this to me "Doctor, heal yourself. We have heard what you did in Capernaum. Do the same things here in your own country."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>And he went on to say, I tell you the truth. No prophet of God is accepted by the people in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>I tell you the truth. At the time of Elijah, there were many women in Israel whose husbands were dead. There was no rain for three years and six months. All over the country there was great trouble because there was no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>But Elijah was not sent to any of these widowed women in Israel. He was sent to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>Also while Elisha was the prophet of God, many people in Israel had leprosy &lt;FI&gt;a bad skin disease&lt;Fi&gt; . None of them was healed. The only one who was healed was Naaman from the country of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>When they heard this, all the people in the meeting house were very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>They jumped to their feet and put Jesus out of the town. Their town was built on a hill.  They took Jesus out to the top and wanted to throw him down the hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But Jesus walked out between them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee. He taught the people there on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>They were surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house. He called in a loud voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>He said, Jesus from Nazareth! What do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us?  I know who you are. You are Gods Holy Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>Jesus said to him, Be quiet! Come out of him! The bad spirit threw the man down in front of them. He came out of the man and did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>All the people were very much surprised. They said to each other, What kind of talk is this? He can make bad spirits obey him. He tells them to come out and they come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>The people in all the places around Capernaum heard about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>Jesus left the meeting house and went to Simons house. The mother of Simons wife was sick with a bad fever. They asked Jesus to help her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>He went and stood beside her. He told the fever to leave her. It left. She got up right away and began to do things for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>When the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick in any way. He put his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>The bad spirits also came out of many people. They called out, You are the Son of God!  But he stopped them. He would not let them talk because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>The next morning Jesus went away to a place by himself. The people went to look for him. When they found him, they did not want him to leave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them, I must tell the good news to the people in other towns also. It is the news of Gods kingdom. I was sent to tell this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>So he told Gods word in the meeting houses in the Galilee area.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>The people came close around Jesus to hear Gods word. He was standing by Lake Gennesaret &lt;FI&gt;the Sea of Galilee&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He saw two boats by the water. The fishermen were not in their boats. They were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Jesus got into one of the boats. It was Simons boat. Jesus asked him to put the boat out into the water a little way from the land. Then he sat down in the boat and taught the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he stopped talking, he said to Simon, Put the boat out into deep water and let down your nets to catch some fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, Master, we worked hard all night and did not catch anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>When they did this, they caught many fish. Their nets were so full they were breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>They called their friends in the other boat to come and help them. They came. They filled both boats with so much fish, they began to go down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he kneeled down in front of Jesus. He said, Lord, leave me because I am a bad man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>He was very much surprised to see how many fish they had caught. All those who were with him were surprised too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were helping Simon. They were surprised also.  Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on your work will be to catch men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>They brought their boats to the land. Then they left everything and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>Jesus was in one of the cities and a man was there who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.  When he saw Jesus, he bowed his face to the ground. He begged Jesus saying, Sir, I know you can heal me if you want to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Jesus put out his hand and touched the man. He said, I want you to be healed. Right away the man was free from leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>Jesus said to him, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you.  Moses gave a law about the sacrifice you must give when you are healed. Give it to prove to the people that you are healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But more people heard about Jesus than before. And many people gathered to hear him,  and so be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>Many times Jesus went away to the desert and talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day Jesus was teaching people. Pharisees and other Jewish teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every town in Galilee and Judea, and from Jerusalem.  Jesus had the power of the Lord to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Some men brought a sick man on his bed. The man could not move his arms or legs.  They tried to bring him in and put him in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>But they could not get in the house where Jesus was, because there were so many people. So they went up on the roof. Then through a hole in the roof they let down the bed with the sick man on it, until he was in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Jesus saw that they believed he would be healed. So he said to him, Man, the wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and Pharisees began to talk about this. They said, Who is this man that is not giving respect to God? No one but God can forgive anyone for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, Why do you think these wrong things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, "The wrong things you have done are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>I want you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive wrong things people have done. So he said to the sick man, I tell you, get up. Take up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Right away the man stood up in front of them. He took up his bed and went home praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>The people were all surprised and they praised God. They did not know what to think.  They said, We have seen things today that are hard to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this, Jesus went out. He saw a tax collector named Levi. Levi was sitting at the place where people came to pay taxes. Jesus said to him Come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>Levi left everything. He stood up and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi made a big dinner at his house for Jesus. Many tax collectors and other people were sitting at the table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>The Pharisees and their scribes did not like what Jesus disciples did. They said, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and bad people?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them, People who are well do not need a doctor. But sick people need him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I did not come to call good people. I came to call bad people to stop doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>They said to him, The disciples or followers of John are often fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating for a time&lt;Fi&gt; , and they talk with God. The disciples of the Pharisees do the same. But your disciples eat and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>Then Jesus said to them, The people at a wedding cannot be sad while the man who is married is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the time will come when he will be taken away from them. Then they will be fasting at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>Jesus told them a short story. He said, No one takes a piece from a new coat and sews it on an old coat. If he does, the new coat will have a hole. And the new piece will not be like the old coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>No one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will break the skins.  The wine will be lost and the skins will be spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>New wine must be put into new skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>No one wants to drink new wine after he has had old wine. He says, "The old is better."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Jesus was walking through the grain fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples picked some of the grain as they went along. They cleaned it by rubbing it in their hands, and ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>Some of the Pharisees said, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat that bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>Jesus said to them, The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>On another Sabbath day, Jesus went into the meeting house and taught. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Come and stand here in front The man stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day, or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so that they will live, or to let them die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>He looked around at them all. Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so and it was made well like the other hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>The Pharisees were very angry and they talked together about what they could do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>About that time Jesus went out of the city on the hill to talk with God. He talked with God all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>In the morning he called his disciples to him. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles &lt;FI&gt;special messengers&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>Then Jesus came down the hill with them and stood on the flat ground. Many people came. There were many of his disciples. And there were many people from all parts of Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from the seaside of Tyre and Sidon. They came to hear him and to be healed because they were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>Some were troubled by bad spirits, and they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>All the people wanted to touch Jesus. Power came from him and he healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Jesus looked at his disciples and said, God will make happy you who are poor. The kingdom of God is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.21'>God will make happy you who are hungry now. You will be filled. God will make happy you who cry now. You will laugh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>He loves our people and he built the meeting house for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Jesus went with them. When he came near the house, the officer sent some friends to meet him and to say, Sir, do not trouble yourself to come further. I am not good enough to have you come into my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>And I did not think I was good enough to come to you. Just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>I myself am a man who takes orders, and I have soldiers who take orders from me. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant,  "Do this," and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Jesus was surprised when he heard this. He turned to the people who followed him. He said, I tell you, I have not found a Jew who believes as this man does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>The men who had been sent to Jesus went back into the house. They found that the servant who had been sick was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Soon after that, Jesus went to the town of Nain. His disciples and many other people went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>He came near the gate of the town. There he met people carrying out a man who had died. He was the only son of his mother. And her husband was dead too. Many people from the city were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>The Lord saw her. He shared in her sorrows and troubles. He said to her, Do not cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Jesus came and touched the thing on which the body lay. The men who were carrying it stopped walking. Jesus said, Young man, I tell you, get up!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>The dead man sat up and began to talk. Jesus gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Everyone was very much surprised. They praised God. They said, A great prophet of God has come to us. God has remembered his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>The people all over Judea and all the country around it heard what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>John also heard about all these things from his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>He called two of them and sent them to Jesus. He asked, Are you the One who is to come? Or shall we wait for another person?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men came to Jesus, they said, John the Baptizer sent us to you. He asks, "Are you the One who is to come? Or shall we wait for another person?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that time Jesus healed many people who were sick or had troubles or bad spirits. He made many blind people able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>He answered Johns disciples, Go tell John what you have seen and heard. Blind people see. The lame people walk. People with leprosy are healed. People who could not hear can hear. Dead people are alive again. Poor people hear the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>Happy is the person who is not troubled in his heart about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>When Johns messengers had gone away, Jesus began to talk to the people about John.  He said, What did you go out into the desert to see? Did you go out to see a tall grass moving in the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>What did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? People who wear fine clothes and have nice things live in kings houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>What did you go out to see? A prophet of God? Yes, I tell you, and he is much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>He is the one the holy writings tell about: "See, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will make the way ready for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you, no one has ever been born who is greater than John. And yet, the smallest one in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>All the people and the tax collectors praised God when they heard that. They had been baptised by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and teachers of the law would not follow Gods way and they were not baptised by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>Jesus asked, What will I say that the people of today are like? What are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children who sit in the market. They call to other children. They say, "We played music for you, but you did not dance. We cried, but you did not cry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>John the Baptizer came. He does not eat bread or drink wine. You say, "He has a bad spirit in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man came. He eats and drinks. You say, "This man eats and drinks too much! He is a friend of tax collectors and bad people!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>A man is proved wise by what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to come and eat with him. So Jesus went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>In that city was a bad woman. When she knew that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house, she came and brought a bottle of oil. It was oil that smelled very sweet and cost much money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>She stood behind Jesus by his feet, and she was crying. She began to wash his feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet and put oil on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>The Pharisee who had asked Jesus to his house saw this. He said to himself, If this man were a prophet of God, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She is a bad woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>Jesus said, There was a man who used to lend money to people. Two people owed him money. One man owed him five hundred pieces of silver money. The other owed him fifty pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>They could not pay the money, so he let them both free. Now which one of them will love him more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, I would say the one he let off the most. Jesus said, You are right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then he turned towards the woman. He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me water to wash my feet. But she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You did not kiss me. But since she came in, she has kissed my feet again and again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not put oil on my head. But she has put sweet smelling oil on my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>So I tell you, she has done many wrong things, but she has been forgiven because she loved me so much. But one who has been forgiven a little loves me only a little</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Jesus said to the woman, The wrong things you have done are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Then those who were at the table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this man?  He even forgives people for the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>Jesus said to the woman, You are saved because you believed. Go in peace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Soon after this, Jesus went through the cities and towns. He told the people Gods word about the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve disciples were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>Some women were also with him. They had bad spirits and had been sick. But they had been healed. One was Mary, called Magdalene. Seven bad spirits had gone out of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Another one was Joanna, the wife of Chuza, who worked for Herod. Another one was Susanna. And there were many others who gave what they could to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>Many people came to him from many towns. Then he told them a story.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>He said, A man went out to sow his seed. As he sowed it, some seed fell on the road.  People stepped on the seed. Birds ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Some seed fell on the stony ground. It grew but soon died because the place was too dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But some seed fell on good ground and it grew well. Those plants gave a hundred times as much grain as the man sowed. When Jesus had said this, he called out, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>His disciples asked Jesus what this story meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But other people must have stories. They will look, but they will not see. They will hear, but they will not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now here is what the story means. The seed is Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Some seeds fell on the road. They are like the people who hear the word of God. Then the devil comes and takes the word out of their hearts. He does not want them to believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Some seeds fell on the stones. They are like people who are glad when they hear the word. But it does not go down deep into their hearts. They believe for a short time. But when they have trouble they stop believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>Some seeds fell among the weeds. They are like people who hear the word. But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and things to be happy in this life. As they go on in life, these things push the message out of their hearts and no good comes from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>Some seeds fell on good ground. They are like people who hear the word and remember it. Their hearts are honest and good. These people keep on believing, and much good comes from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No person lights a lamp and covers it with a basket or puts it under a bed. But he puts it on the place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>So take care how you listen. Anyone who has something will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>The mother of Jesus and his brothers came to him. They could not reach him because there were so many people around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>Someone told him, Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he said to them, These people who hear the word of God and do it, they are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples. He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea. So they started out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>While they were going, Jesus was sleeping. A bad storm came on the sea. Water was coming into the boat, and they were in trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>The disciples came to Jesus and woke him. They shouted, Master! Master! We will die!  Jesus woke and said to the wind and the water, Stop! They stopped. Then all was quiet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to the disciples, Why do you not believe God? They were afraid and surprised.  They said to each other, What kind of man is this? He tells the wind and the sea what to do and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarene people. Their country is on the other side of the sea from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>As Jesus got out of the boat a man met him from the town. He had bad spirits in him. He had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house, but among the graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he screamed loudly and bowed down in front of him. He called out loud, Jesus, Son of the Highest One! What do you want to do to me? I beg you, do not hurt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>He said this because Jesus had told the bad spirit to come out of the man. Many times the spirit had taken hold of the man. People had guarded him. They had tied him with chains and strong ropes. But he broke the chains and ropes. The bad spirit drove him into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, What is your name? He answered, My name is An Army. He said this because many bad spirits had gone into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>The spirits begged Jesus not to send them away to the big hole that has no bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Many pigs were feeding on the hill there. The spirits begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs. Jesus let them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. They ran fast down the steep hill into the sea. They died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The men who cared for the pigs saw what happened. They ran and told it to the people in the town and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>The people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus. They saw the man from whom the bad spirits had gone. He was sitting near the feet of Jesus. He had clothes on and was not crazy any more. The people were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Those who had seen it told the people how the man had been saved from the bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>All the people in the country around the Gadarenes asked Jesus to go away from them to some other place. They were very much afraid. So Jesus got into a boat and went back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man from whom the bad spirits had gone begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>He said, Go home and tell the people what God has done for you. So the man went away and told the people all through the town what Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>When Jesus came back, the people were very glad to see him. They were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>A man named Jairus came to him. He was a ruler in the meeting house. He bowed down in front of Jesus and begged him to come to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>He had only one daughter She was about twelve years old. And she was dying. Many people went with Jesus and pushed against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>A woman among them had a sickness for twelve years. She was bleeding all the time.  She had given all her money to the doctors, but no one had been able to heal her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>She came behind Jesus and touched his clothes. The bleeding stopped right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus said, Who touched me? Everyone said, Not I! Peter said, Master, the people are all around you and push you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, Someone touched me. I know that power to heal went out from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>The woman saw that he knew about her. So she came trembling and bowed down in front of him. She told him in front of all the people why she had touched him. She told him that she had been healed right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>Jesus said to her, Daughter, you were healed because you believed. Go and do not be troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still talking, a man came from the rulers house. He said, Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus heard it. He said, Do not fear. Only believe and she will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When Jesus came to the house, he did not let the people go in with him. The only people he let go in were Peter, John and James, and the girls father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>All the people were crying and making a lot of noise because she had died. But he said,  Do not cry. She is not dead, but sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed at him because they knew she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>He took her hand and called out, Little girl, get up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Her life came back and she got up right away. He told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were very much surprised. Jesus said, Do not tell anyone what has happened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Jesus called his twelve disciples together. He gave them power over all the bad spirits,  and power to heal sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>He sent them out to tell people about the kingdom of God and to heal sick people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He said, Take nothing with you for your trip. Do not take a walking stick, or a bag, or food, or money. And do not take two shirts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>Some people might not take you in. When you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a sign to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>The disciples left and went through the towns. They told the good news and healed people everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening. He did not know what to think.  Some people said John the Baptizer had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>Some people said Elijah had come back. And other people said that one of the old prophets of God had risen from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, I cut off Johns head. Now who is this man of whom I hear such things? He wanted to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>When the apostles came back, they told Jesus all they had done. He took them away with him and they went by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the people found out and they followed him. He was glad to see them and talked to them about Gods kingdom. He healed those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>When it was late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him. They said, Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat.  This is a lonely place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But Jesus said to them, You give them food to eat. They said, All we have is five loaves of bread and two fish. Shall we go and buy food for all these people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, Tell the people to sit down in groups of fifty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>Jesus said to them, Do not tell this to anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>Then he went on to say, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. On the third day he will be raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And He said to all the people, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. Every day he must take up his cross &lt;FI&gt;be ready to die&lt;Fi&gt; and come with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>If anyone is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of man will come with his holy angels and be great like his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after saying these things, Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God. He took Peter, John, and James with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>As he was talking with God, he was changed. His face was different. His clothes became very white and shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And then two men were talking with Jesus. They were Moses and Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>Light was shining from them. They talked about his leaving this world. That would happen when he was in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Peter and the others were very sleepy. They woke up and saw the light shining from Jesus. And they saw the two men standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>When the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, Master, it is good for us to be here.  Let us make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Peter did not know what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>As he said this, a cloud came over them. They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>The talking stopped. Then Jesus was left alone. The disciples did not say anything. They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>The next day they came down the hill. Many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>One man among them called out, Teacher, I beg you, look at my son. He is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>A bad spirit takes hold of him and he screams. It throws him around and makes him foam at his mouth. It beats him badly and does not want to leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I begged your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>While he was coming, the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around. Jesus told the spirit to stop. He healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power. While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did, he talked to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>He said, Listen well to what I say. The Son of Man will be given over to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand what he said. The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>The disciples started talking among themselves. They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and put him by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>Then he said, If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. And if anyone takes in me, he takes in the one who sent me. The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John answered, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name. We told him to stop because he is not one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who is not against you is on your side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>The time was near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven. Then he started off for Jerusalem.  He sent messengers ahead of him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>The Son of Man did not come to kill people, but to save them. And they went on to another town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they went along on the road, a man said to him, I will go anywhere you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>After this the Lord chose seventy other men. He sent them ahead of him, two by two. He sent them to every town and village that he was going to visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>He said to them, The harvest is much, but there are not many people to gather it. So talk to the Lord of this harvest and ask him to send out people to his harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go on your way now. I am sending you out among people. You will be like sheep among bad animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Do not take money, or a bag, or shoes. And do not stop to talk with anyone on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>When you go into a house, first say, "May God give peace to this family."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.6'>If a man of peace is there, your blessing will stay with him. If not, your blessing will come back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.7'>Stay in that house. Eat and drink what the people give you. The one who works should have his pay for it. Do not move from one house to another house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.8'>When you go into a town and they take you in, eat what is put before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>Heal the sick people in the town. Tell the people, "The kingdom of God has come to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But when you go into a town and they do not take you in, then go out into the streets of the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.11'>Say to the people, "We wipe off even the dust of the town that is on our feet. This will be a sign to you. But remember this, the kingdom of God has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>I tell you this. On the day when people are judged, they will be punished more than the people in the city of Sodom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>Chorazin, you will have trouble! Bethsaida, you will have trouble! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have stopped doing bad things long ago. They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad, and would sit in ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>But on the day when people are judged you will be punished more than the people in the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the sky? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>Anyone who listens to you listens to me. Anyone who does not believe you does not believe me. Anyone who does not believe me does not believe the one who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>The seventy men Jesus had sent out came back very happy. They said, Lord, even the bad spirits obey us when we talk to them in your name!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>Jesus said to them, I saw Satan fall from the sky like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>I have given you power over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Do not be glad that the bad spirits obey you. But be glad that your names are written in the book in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>At that same time the Holy Spirit made Jesus very happy. Jesus said, Father, you are Lord of heaven and earth. I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things. But you have shown them to people who are like children. Yes, Father. That was the way you wanted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>My Father has given everything to me. No one knows who the Son is but the Father. No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said to them alone, God is blessing the eyes of people who see what you see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>I tell you this. Many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see. But they did not see them. They wanted to hear the things you hear. But they did not hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>A man who taught Gods law stood up and asked Jesus a question to try him out.  Teacher, he said. What must I do so that I will live for ever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>Jesus said to him, What does the law say? What do you read there?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>The man answered, You must love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul. Love him with all your power, and love him with all your mind. And you must love your neighbour as you love yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.28'>Jesus said, That is the right answer. Do that and you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But the man wanted to prove that he was all right. So he said to Jesus, Who is my neighbour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus answered, A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho. Bad men caught him on the road. They took his clothes and beat him. Then they went away and left him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>A priest happened to be going down that road. He saw the man but he passed by on the other side of the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.32'>A man who worked in the temple came along to that place also. He saw the man but he passed by on the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>A man from the country of Samaria was going on that road also, and came to the place.  He saw the man and wanted to share in his troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>He went to him and tied up the sores he had from the beating. He washed them with oil and wine. Then he lifted the man up and set him on his own animal to ride. He took him to the house for strangers. And he cared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>The next day he gave two pieces of money to the man who was in charge of the house for strangers. He said, "Take care of this man. If it costs you more than this, I will pay you when I come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>Jesus said to the teacher of the law, What do you think? Which of these three was a neighbour to the man who was caught by the bad men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>He said, The man who was kind to him. Jesus said, Go and do as he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>Jesus and his disciples went on their way. They came to a town. A woman named Martha took him into her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>She had a sister named Mary. Mary sat near the feet of Jesus and she listened to what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.40'>But Martha was very busy doing many things for Jesus. She came to Jesus and said,  Lord, my sister has left me to do all the work. Do you not care? Tell her to come and help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.41'>The Lord answered her, Martha, Martha, you are worrying. You are troubled about many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.42'>Only one thing is needed. What Mary has chosen is good. And it will not be taken away from her.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>One day Jesus was in a place talking with God. When he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to talk with God as John taught his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.2'>Jesus said, When you talk with God, say, "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.4'>Forgive us for the wrong things we have done. We forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. Do not lead us to be tested."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.5'>Jesus said to them, Maybe one of you has a friend. You go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.6'>A friend has come to my house. He has been on the road. I have no food to give him to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.7'>Maybe the friend in the house answers you and says, "Do not trouble me. The door is locked. And my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.8'>I tell you this. Maybe he will not give him anything because he is his friend. But he will get up and give him what he needs because he keeps on asking for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.9'>And I tell you, ask and you will get what you ask for. Look and you will find what you look for. Knock and the door will be opened for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.10'>Everyone who asks will get. The one who looks will find. And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.11'>Which of you fathers will give your son a snake if he asks for a fish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.12'>Will you give him a scorpion &lt;FI&gt;an insect with a sting&lt;Fi&gt; if he asks for an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>You are wrong and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  the Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>Jesus was driving a bad spirit out of a man who could not talk. When the spirit left him,  the man could talk. The people were surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>But some of them said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>Other people wanted to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is spoiled. And if one part of any family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.18'>If Satan fights against himself, how will his kingdom stand? You say I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.19'>If I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, by whose help do your own people drive them out? Your own people will judge you for this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.20'>But if I drive out bad spirits by the help of God, then know this, Gods kingdom is here with you now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.21'>A strong man has something in his hand to fight. He guards his place. He will not lose his things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.22'>But when a stronger man comes, he catches the man who guards his house. He will take away what is in the mans hand. And he will take his things and give them to his friends.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.24'>When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any. Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.25'>When he comes back, he finds it clean and all fixed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.26'>Then he goes and brings seven other spirits who are worse than he is. They go in and live there. Now the man is worse than he was at first.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.29'>More and more people were coming. He started to talk. He said, People today are bad.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah the prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.30'>Jonah was a sign to the men in the city of Nineveh. In the same way the Son of Man will be a sign to the people today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.31'>When the people are judged, the Queen from the South will stand up and speak against men who live today. She came a long way to hear the wise words of Solomon. The one who is here is greater than Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.32'>When people are judged, the men of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. They stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.33'>No person lights a lamp and hides it in a hole or puts it under a basket. But he puts it on a place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.34'>Your body gets its light through your eyes. When you have good eyes, all your body has light. But when your eyes are bad, your body is in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.35'>So be sure that it is not dark in you where it should be light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.39'>The Lord said to him, You Pharisees wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean. But inside you are full of greed and wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.40'>You are fools! Did not God make the outside and inside also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.41'>Do good, and do it from your heart. Then everything is clean for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.42'>You Pharisees will have trouble! You give to God a tenth part of small garden plants. But you do not judge in the right way. And you do not love God. You should do these things and the other things too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.43'>You Pharisees will have trouble! In the meeting houses you want to sit in the front seats.  And in the market you want people to greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.44'>You will have trouble! You are not true to yourselves! You are like graves that are not marked. Men walk over them and do not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.45'>Then one of the men who taught Gods law said to Jesus, Teacher, when you say these things, you talk against us too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.46'>Jesus said, You men will have trouble also! You put heavy loads on peoples backs. But you yourselves will not put up one finger to help carry the loads.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.48'>In this way you show you agree to the things your fathers did. They killed the prophets,  and you build places to bury them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.49'>That is why God, who is wise, said, "I will send prophets and messengers to them. They will kill some of them. And they will trouble some of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.50'>So the people who are living now will be punished for all the blood of the prophets of God that is on the ground since the world was made.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.52'>You teachers of Gods law will have trouble! You have taken away the key of the door where people can go in and know what is true. You yourselves did not go in, and you stopped those who were going in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.53'>When Jesus left the house, the scribes and Pharisees began to be very angry with him.  They asked him questions about many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.54'>They wanted him to say something that was wrong so they could make trouble for him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.15'>Then he said to the people, Take care. Do not be greedy in any way to get more and more things. Even if a man has much more than he needs, it cannot give him life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.16'>Then he told them a story. He said, A rich man had a farm. The things that grew on it were many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.17'>He said to himself, "What will I do? I have no place to keep all the food I have grown."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.20'>But God said to him, "You are a fool! Tonight you will die. Then who will have all the things you have kept for yourself?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.27'>Think about the flowers. See how they grow. They do not work or make cloth. I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.12.28'>God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is burned. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>A big stone should be tied around his neck and then he should be thrown into the sea.  That would be better for him than to make one of these little children do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.3'>Take care! If your brother does something bad, tell him what he has done. If he is sorry,  then forgive him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>Jesus told them a story to teach them that they should keep on talking with God and not give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>He said, There was a judge in a city. He did not respect God or care about people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>There was a woman in that city whose husband was dead. The woman came to the judge again and again. She said, "Save me from my enemy!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>For a long time he would not do it. But after a time he said, "I do not respect God or care about people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>But this woman is troubling me. So I will save her from her enemy. If I do not, she will keep coming until I am tired."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>The Lord said, The judge was a bad man. And yet you should listen to what he says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>When the people whom God has chosen call to him day and night, he will save them from their enemies. He may let them wait a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>But I tell you, he will save them from their enemies soon. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find any people who believe in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>There were some people who thought they were very good. And they thought that other people were not good. Jesus told this story to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>He said, Two men went to the temple to talk with God. One was a Pharisee and the other one was a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and said to himself, "God, I thank you that I am not like other men.  They steal, cheat, and commit adultery. I thank you that I am not like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>Two times in the week I do not eat-I fast. I give away one tenth part of all I get."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>The tax collector stood far away. He did not even look up towards heaven. But he beat his chest, and said, "God, I am a bad man. Help me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, when this man went home, he was right with God. The other one was not.  Everyone who puts himself up in a high place will be brought down to a low place. And everyone who puts himself in a low place will be brought up to a high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>People brought even small children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them.  When the disciples saw it, they tried to stop the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to him and said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of God belongs to people like them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the laws, "Do not commit adultery. &lt;FI&gt;Do not take a man or woman who is not your husband or wife.&lt;Fi&gt; Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not tell lies. Respect your father and your mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>The man said, I have kept all these laws since I was a boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>When Jesus heard that, he said to him, You need one thing more. Sell everything you have. Give the money to poor people. You will be rich in heaven. Then come and go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>When the man heard that, he was sad because he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>Jesus looked at him and said, It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>Those who heard it asked, Then who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But Jesus said, God can do what men cannot do.</verse>

If any man has left his house, or his wife, or his brothers, or his father, or his mother, or his children for the sake of the kingdom of God,  he will receive many times as much as he has left. He will receive that in this world. And in the next world he will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Jesus took the twelve disciples with him. He said to them, We are going to Jerusalem.  The prophets of God long ago wrote about the Son of Man. Everything they wrote will be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>He will be given over to rulers who are not Jews. They will make fun of him. They will treat him very badly. They will spit on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>Jesus said, You can see now. You are healed because you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>Right then he was able to see. He went with Jesus and he praised God. All the people saw it and they all praised God too.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>Jesus came to the city of Jericho and was passing through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>A man named Zacchaeus was there. He was the head tax collector, and he was a rich man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>He wanted to see who Jesus was but he could not see him because he was a short man and there were many people around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>So he ran ahead and climbed into a tree to see Jesus, for he was coming that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up. He said, Zacchaeus, come down right now.  I must stay at your house today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So Zacchaeus came down right then. He was glad to have Jesus come in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>When all the people saw this, they did not like it. They said, He has gone to visit a bad man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, I will give to the poor people half of all I have. And if I have cheated anyone, I will give him back four times as much as I took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>Jesus said to him, The head of this house has been saved today! He also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>While they were listening to this, he started to tell them a story. He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>So he said, A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away. He went to get power to rule. Then he was going to come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>Before he left, he called ten of his servants. He gave each of them some money. He said,  "Go and trade with this money until I come back."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>But he was given the power to rule and came back. Then he called the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much money each one had made by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>The first one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made ten times more money."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>The ruler said, "You have done well. You are a good servant. You will rule over ten cities because you have done well with a very small thing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>The second one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made five times more money."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why did you not put my money in the bank? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>Some men were standing there. He said to them, "Take the money from him. Give it to the man who has ten times as much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They said, "Sir, he has ten times as much already!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>The ruler said, "I tell you. Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>They went and found it just as Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>When they were untying the animal, the men who owned it asked them, Why are you untying the animal?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>He came near the top of the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then all the people who believed in him began to be happy. They sang out loudly, and praised God in a loud voice for all the big works they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>They said, God bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven where God is praised!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One day Jesus was teaching the people in the temple. He was telling them Gods good news. The chief priests and the scribes came to him with the leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>They said to him, Tell us what right you have to do these things. Who gave you the right to do them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answered, I will ask you a question also. Tell me this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Who gave John the right to baptise people? Did God or did men give it to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>They talked it over together. They said, If we say, "God gave John the right to do it," he will say, "Then why did you not believe him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, "Men gave him the right to do it," then the people will kill us with stones.  They believe that John was a prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered Jesus, We do not know who gave him the right to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Then Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you what right I have to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then Jesus began to tell the people this story. A man planted a farm. He let some men use the farm. They paid him money for the rent. Then he went to a country far away and stayed a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>At harvest time the owner sent one of his servants to the men who used the farm. He wanted to have some fruit from the farm. But the men beat the servant and sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>So he sent another servant. They beat this one also, and did wrong things to him. And they sent him away without any fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>He sent a servant the third time. They hurt this one also and threw him out of the farm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the man who owned the farm said, "What shall I do? I will send my dear son.  Maybe they will respect him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the men saw him they said to each other, "This is the one who will have everything when his father dies. Let us kill him. Then everything will belong to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>They dragged him off the farm and killed him. What will the man who owned the farm do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come back and kill those men. And he will give the farm to other men to use.  When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they said, May it not be so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But Jesus looked right at them. He said, What about this writing then? "The stone which the builders would not use is now the chief corner stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But if that stone falls on anyone, it will crush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>The scribes and the chief priests wanted to catch Jesus right then but they feared the people. They understood that he had told this story against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>So they watched for a chance to catch him. And they sent men to spy on him. These men acted as if they were good men. They did this because they wanted to catch him in something that he said. They wanted to give him over to the ruler who would judge and punish him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>So they asked Jesus, Teacher, we know that you talk and teach what is right. You do not fear any person. But you teach the true way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it right to pay money as taxes to Caesar or is it not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>He knew they were trying to get him into trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>So he said, Show me a piece of money. Whose picture and name are on it? They said,  Caesars</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>Then he said to them, So give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>They were not able to catch him in anything he said in front of the people. They were surprised at his answer and they could not say anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. (They say that people do not rise from death.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>They came to ask Jesus a question. Teacher, they said, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and leaves a wife but no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were seven brothers. The first one married. He died and left no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>The second one married the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>Then the third one married her. All seven brothers married her. They all had no children and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all, the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Now then, when people rise from death, whose wife will she be? All seven of them had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jesus said to them, Men and women in this world marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But men and women who are good enough to have a place in the next world and to be raised from death do not marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>They cannot die again. They are like angels. They are Gods children because they have been raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Even Moses showed that people do rise from death. It is in his book where we read about the small tree which burned. Moses says that the Lord is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>He is not the God of dead people, but of living people. All people are alive to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Some of the scribes said to him, Teacher, what you say is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>After that, people were afraid to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But Jesus asked them, How can people say that Christ is Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>, fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>David himself says in the book of the Psalms, "The LORD said to my Lord, sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>So David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then Jesus talked to his disciples while all the people could hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>He said, Take care. Do not let the scribes fool you. They like to walk about dressed in long gowns. They want people to greet them in the market. They want to have the front seats in the meeting houses. They want to sit in the best places at feasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>They take away the homes of women whose husbands are dead. They cover up their wrong ways by talking to God a long time. They will be punished more!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Jesus looked around in the temple. He saw the place where the people put in their money. Rich people were putting in their money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>And he saw a poor woman whose husband was dead. She put in two small pieces of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This poor woman has given more than all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>All these people had plenty of money and they gave only a part of it. She was poor and she gave everything she had. She has nothing left to live on.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>Jesus said, You see these things. Not one stone here will be left on top of another. They will all be thrown down!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>In some places the earth will shake very much. In many places the people will have no food to eat. And many people will be sick. There will be things to make people fear.  There will be big signs in the sky.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>In those days it will be very hard for women who are to have a child. It will be very hard for mothers who have babies. There will be big trouble on the earth. God will show his anger to these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>They will be killed by swords or long knives. They will be taken away as prisoners to every country. Jerusalem will be broken down by people who are not Jews. They will walk over it until the end of their allowed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And there will be much trouble for the people on earth. They will not know what to do. It will be like the sound of big waves of the sea.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>But take care. Do not think too much about eating, drinking, and things in this life. If you do, that day will come and catch you like a trap.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>It was near the time for the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. This is called the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>The chief priests and the scribes planned how to kill Jesus. But they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Satan came into the heart of Judas. Judas was one of the twelve disciples. His other name was Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>Judas went away and talked things over with the chief priests and captains. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>They were glad, and they said they would give him money for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>He agreed. He watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus when there were not too many people around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>It was the day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying to them, Go and get the Passover Feast ready for us to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They asked, Where do you want us to get it ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He said, When you go into the city, a man carrying a pot of water will meet you. Follow him into the house where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Tell the master of the house, "The Teacher says, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>He will show you a large room upstairs. It will be all fixed up. Make it ready there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found everything just the way Jesus had said. Then they made the Passover food ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When it was time to eat, he sat down at the table and the apostles sat down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>He said to them, I have wanted very much to eat this Passover Feast with you before my troubles come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>I tell you this. I will not eat it again until the great feast in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>He took the cup and thanked God. He said, Take this. All of you drink from this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>I tell you this. I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>He took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, This is my body, which is given for you. When you do this, then remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>In the same way he took the cup after they had eaten. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. It is given for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>There is a man who will give me over to my enemies. His hand is here at the table with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>The Son of Man will go on as it was planned for him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>The disciples began to ask each other, Which of us will do this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>They started to quarrel among themselves about which of them was the greatest person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>Jesus said to them, The kings of countries make their people obey them. Those who rule give themselves a good name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But it must not be so among you. The one who is greatest among you must be like the most unimportant. And the leader must be like one who helps others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>Which man is greater, the man who sits at the table or the man who helps him? Is it not the man who sits at the table? But I am like the man who helps you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You have stayed with me through my troubles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>My Father made me a ruler, and now I make you rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>You will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will sit on chief chairs or thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked to have all of you. He wants to shake you like grain with the cleaning fan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have talked to God about you, Simon, so that you will keep on believing in me. And when you come back, then help your brothers to be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>Simon said, Lord, I will go with you, even to prison or to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jesus said, I tell you this, Peter. This very day, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Jesus said to them, When I sent you out to the towns, I told you not to carry a money bag, or a bag, or shoes. Did you ever need anything at that time? They said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He said, But this time, anyone who has money should take it and his bag too. Anyone who has no sword should sell his coat and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>The holy writings say, "He was counted as one of the bad people." And I tell you, that means me. And the things that are written about me must happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>The disciples said, Look, Lord, here are two swords. And he answered, That is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then Jesus went out of the room and went to the hill called the Mount of Olives where he often went. His disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>He said to them, Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>He went away from them about as far as a person can throw a stone. Then he kneeled down to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>He said, Father, if you will, take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want but what you want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel came to him from heaven and helped to make him strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>His heart was troubled very much. So he talked with God more than before. His sweat was like big drops of blood falling on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>He stopped talking with God and got up. He went to his disciples and found them sleeping because they were sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Get up. Talk with God so that you will not do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>As Jesus was saying this, many men came. One of the twelve disciples, named Judas,  was leading the people. He came near Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jesus said to him, Judas, will you give over the Son of Man to his enemies with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>The disciples around Jesus saw what was going to happen. They said, Lord, shall we fight with our swords?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>One of them hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Jesus said, Just let me do this. And he touched the mans ear and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>The chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the leaders of the people had come to catch Jesus. He said to them, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks, the way you catch a man who steals?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>I was with you every day in the temple. You did not try to catch me then. But this is your time now, the time of the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>The men caught Jesus and took him away to the high priests house. Peter followed them far behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>They made a fire in the yard and sat around it. Peter sat down with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>A woman saw Peter sitting by the fire. She looked at him and said, This man was with him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But Peter said, Woman, I do not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>After a while, another person saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour later another person said, Surely this man was with him. He comes from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And right then, while he was talking, the cock called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered that the Lord had said to him, Before the cock calls in the morning, you will say three times that you do not know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>Peter went out and cried very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>The men who guarded Jesus made fun of him and beat him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>They tied something over his eyes. Then they hit him in the face and said, Tell us if you know who hit you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they said many other wrong things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>In the morning the leaders of the people, the chief priests and scribes met together. They took Jesus to their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>They said, If you are the Christ, tell us. Jesus said, If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>And if I ask you anything, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>From this time on the Son of Man will sit beside God who has all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>They all said, Then are you the Son of God?" He said, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>They said, We do not need any more proof against him. We ourselves have heard what he said.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then all the people got up and took Jesus to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>They began to make a complaint against him. They said, This man is leading our people to do wrong. He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He says that he is Christ, a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate asked Jesus, Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, Yes, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find nothing wrong in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they said all the more, He troubles the people by his teaching. He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea. He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard this, he asked, Is this man from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>When he knew that he came from Herods country, he sent him to Herod. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>He was glad to see Jesus. He had heard about him. And he had wanted to see him for a long time. He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The chief priests and the scribes stood near. They brought strong complaints against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that, they had hated each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate then called the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>He said to them, You brought this man to me. You said he is leading your people to do wrong. I have asked questions here in front of you. I have found nothing wrong in this man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>So I will beat him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>At the feast Pilate always let one man go free.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate talked to the people again. He wanted to let Jesus go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Pilate said to them the third time, Why, what wrong thing has he done? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die. So I will beat him and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they shouted all the more loudly, saying, Nail him to a cross! And Pilate gave in to their shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So he said they could have it their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He let the other man go free. (He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man. He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free.) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>They took Jesus away. On the way, they caught a man who was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>Many people followed him. Women cried and were sorry for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not cry for me. But cry for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>The time will come when people will say, "Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then people will begin to say to the big hills, "Fall on us." They will say to the small hills,  "Hide us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>If this is what people do when the wood is new, what will they do when it is old?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus. They were bad men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>They came to the place called Calvary (the head bone.) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also. They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus said, Father, forgive them! They do not know what they are doing. The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>The people stood around watching. But the rulers made fun of him. They said, He saved other people. He should save himself if he is Gods Christ, Gods chosen one!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers made fun of him. They came and brought him wine to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>They said, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>The sign that was put above Jesus head said, This is the King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus. He said If you are the Christ, why do you not save yourself and us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other bad man told him to stop. He said, Do you not even fear God? You are being punished just as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things. But this man has done nothing bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you become a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in Gods garden of paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun did not shine. The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Jesus called out loud, Father, I put my spirit into your hands! When he had said this, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>The captain saw all this. Then he praised God. He said, Surely, this was a good man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>Many people were around there to look on. When they saw what happened, they all went home beating their chests &lt;FI&gt;because they were sad&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>All Jesus friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away.  They saw all of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>There was a man named Joseph. He was a member of the court. He was a good man who lived the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>He had not wanted the people to do what they did. He was looking for the kingdom of God. He was from a town of the Jews, called Arimathea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>He took the body down from the cross. He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock. No one had ever been put in this grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the day before the Sabbath. And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee. They followed and saw the grave where his body was put.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body. These things were spices that smelled very nice, and sweet kinds of oil. On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>On the first day of the week, early in the morning, the women went to the grave. They took with them the things they had made ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, Why do you look for a living person among dead people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered what he had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>They were talking together about all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>Jesus asked them, What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Jesus said, What things?" They said, All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Then he said to them, You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>But they begged him not to go further. They said, Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished. So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>They said to each other, It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>These people said, The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them,  Peace to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>They gave him a piece of cooked fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>He took the fish and ate it in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>Then he said, I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>He said, It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>You are the men who have seen these things, and will tell people about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>They bowed down and worshipped him. They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>Every day they were in the temple praising God.</verse>
