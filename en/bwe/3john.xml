        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>From the leader of the church people. I send greetings to my dear Gaius. I love you because you have Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>My dear brother, I ask God that you may be all right in every way and that your body may be well. I know that your soul is all right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>I was very happy when the brothers came and told me that you have been true. They said you are really living the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>Nothing can make me more happy than to hear that my children are living in the right way. My dear brother, when you help your Christian brothers in any way, even though you do not know them, you show that you do what you say you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>They have told the people of the church here how you showed your love to them. Please send them on their way as God would have you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>They went out to do Christs work. And they have not taken any help from people who do not believe in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>So we should help such men with what they need. Then we are doing our part to tell the true message. I wrote a letter to the people of the church. But Diotrephes wants to be the leader. He will not listen to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>So if I come, I will show what he is doing. He is saying wrong things about us. And that is not all. He does not take our brothers into his own home. And he stops other people who want to take them in. He will not let them be church members any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>My dear brother, do not do the wrong things people do, but do the good things people do.  Anyone who does good things belongs to God. Anyone who does wrong things has never seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Everyone says Demetrius is a good man. All this is true. We say the same thing too. And you know that what we say is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>I have much to write to you. But I do not want to write to you with pen and ink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>I hope to see you very soon. Then we will talk together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>May God give you peace. Our friends greet you. Greet everyone of my friends.</verse>
