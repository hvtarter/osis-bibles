        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>I am Paul. God called me to be an apostle of Jesus Christ. He did this because he wanted to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>Our Christian brother Sosthenes and I send greetings to the people who are the church of God in the city of Corinth. You are people whom Christ Jesus has made holy. You, too,  are chosen to be Gods people. And we send greetings to all the people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is their Lord, just as he is our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>May God show you his kindness and peace which come from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I am always thanking God for the blessings he has given you through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>He has made you rich in all ways, in all that you say and in all you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>Christ has done for you just what he promised to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>You have every blessing you need while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>And right to the end Jesus Christ will surely keep you safe. Then no one will find anything wrong about you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God never fails anyone. It is he who called you to belong to his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>My Christian brothers, I beg you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, agree in what you say. Do not divide into groups. You should all think in the same way and decide to do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>My brothers, I say this because I have been told by some of Chloes family that you are quarrelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>This is what I mean. Some of you say, I belong to Paul. Others say, I belong to Apollos. And others say, I belong to Cephas.And yet others say, I belong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul nailed to the cross for you? No! Were you baptized in Pauls name? No!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I did not baptize any of you but Crispus and Gaius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>So no one can say you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(However, I also baptized the people of the house of Stephanas. I do not know of any one else that I baptized.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>Christ did not send me to baptize people, but he sent me to tell the good news. I must not tell it with the clever words of this world. That would not show what the death of Christ on a cross truly means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>When people who are turning away from God hear about the cross, they say, That is foolish! But for us who are being saved, the cross is the power God uses to save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>God says in the holy writings, I will fool the wise people. I will bring to nothing the understanding of the clever people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where are your wise people, the men who know books, the men who like to talk about the things of this world? God has shown that the clever things of this world are nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>God is wise. But the people of the world were not wise enough to know God. So he chose to save people who believe the good news that we tell them, even though the good news may seem to be foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>The Jews say, We must see a sign. Those who are not Jews say, We want something we can understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>But we tell people about Christ who died on a cross. The leaders of the Jews do not like this, and those who are not Jews laugh at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But some have been called by God. They are chosen, both Jews and other people. Christ is Gods power to save them. This shows how wise he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>When God seems foolish, he is more wise than men. When God seems weak, he is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>My brothers, remember what you were when God chose you. Not many of you were wise by the way people look at it. Not many of you had power. Not many of you came from a family with a big name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose things that look foolish to the people of the world. He has used those foolish things to put the wise people to shame. God chose the weak things to put to shame the strong people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And God chose the small things, things that people despise. Yes, he chose even the things which seem to be nothing. He did this to destroy the big things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>He did this so that people would not be proud before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>You are Gods children through Christ Jesus. Christ came from God and made us wise.  He put us right with God. He made us holy. He set us free from our wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>Just as the holy writings say, No one should be proud of anything but of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>So, my brothers, when I came to you, I did not come to tell you Gods message in big or wise words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>I made up my mind that I would talk about only one thing while I was with you. That one thing was Jesus Christ and his death on a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>I was weak, afraid, and trembling when I visited you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My words and my message were not in wise words to win you. But the power of the Spirit of God proved my words to be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>I did this so that you would not believe because of mans wise words, but you would believe because of Gods power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, our words are wise words to those who really believe. But they are not the kind of wise words that the people of this world speak. They are not the kind of wise words that the rulers of this world speak. Those rulers will die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>Our wise words are Gods wise words about things people do not understand. Before God made the world he planned those things for our glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this world knew about these things. If they had, they would not have killed on a cross the Lord who was full of Gods glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>The holy writings say, No eye has seen the things God has made ready for those who love him. No ear has heard about them. No persons heart has ever thought of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>God has shown these things to us by his Spirit. The Spirit understands everything, even the things that God has kept secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>The only one who really knows what a person is thinking is the spirit of the person himself. So also, no one knows what God is thinking, only the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>We have not received the spirit of the world. But we have received the Spirit of God. In this way we may understand the blessings which God has freely given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>We do not tell you these things in wise words which men taught us. But the Holy Spirit taught us. We teach things about the Spirit which we know about through the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>The person who does not have the Spirit does not receive the blessings of the Spirit of God. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because only people who have the Spirit of God can test them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>He who has the Spirit of God tests all things. But others cannot test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>The holy writings say: Who knows the mind of the Lord so that he may teach him? As for us, we really do have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>My brothers, I could not talk to you at first as to people who have the Spirit of God. But I talked to you as people who have the spirit of this world. I talked to you as people who are very new-born, baby Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, not food to eat. You were not ready for food. And even now you are not ready for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>You still have the spirit of this world in you. You are jealous of each other and you are quarrelling. The spirit of this world is still in you and you live like people of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>One says, I belong to Paul. Another says, I belong to Apollos. Does not that show that you have the spirit of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>After all, who is Apollos? And who is Paul? We both work for God. You believed because of the work we did. The Lord gave each of us our work to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted the seed. Apollos put water on the seed. But God made the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then the man who plants is nothing and the man who waters is nothing. God alone makes the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>The man who plants and the man who waters are equal. Each one will be paid for his own work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>We work together for God. You are Gods farm. You are Gods house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>I built the lower walls of the house because God showed me the best way to do it. Now another man builds on top of this foundation. Each man must take care how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>Jesus Christ himself is the foundation. No one can make another one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>People build with gold, silver, very fine stones, wood, grass, or straw on top of the foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>But the day will come when everyones work can be seen. Their work will be tested by fire and the fire will show what kind of work each one did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work a man did is not burned up in the fire, he will be paid for his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>But if a mans work is burned up, he will lose everything. He himself will be saved, like a man pulled out of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>You know that you are Gods house. The spirit of God lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>God will punish anyone who spoils his house. His house is holy, and you are the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Do not be fooled. If any one of you thinks that he is wise in the things of this world, he should count himself as not being wise. Then he would really be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>The things that look wise to the people of this world look foolish to God. The holy writings say, He catches the wise people in their own tricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>It also says, The Lord knows that the wise mens thoughts are good for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So do not be proud of men. Everything belongs to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life, death, the things which are now, and the things which are to come, everything is yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>People should look at us as men who are servants of Christ. We take care of the secret things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>A man who takes care of things must be a person his master can trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>As for me, I care very little what you think about me or how any man judges me. I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>I do not know of anything wrong in me, but that does not say I am right. The Lord is my judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So do not judge me before it is time. Wait until the Lord comes. The things which have been kept hidden in the dark he will bring out into the light. He will show what is in peoples hearts. At that time God will tell each man how good his work is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>My brothers, I have said these things about Apollos and myself so that you will learn from us to live the way the holy writings say. Then you will not be proud and say, This teacher is better than that one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>If you are better, who made you that way? Everything you have was given to you. So then, why are you proud of it? Was it not given to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>So you think you now have everything you need and are rich! You think you are kings and do not need us! I wish that you really were kings. Then we would be kings along with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>It seems to me that God has put us apostles at the end of the line. We are like men who are to be put to death. The whole world, angels and men, look at us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christs sake! But you think Christ has made you wise. We are weak,  but you are strong! You have glory, we have shame!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even now we are hungry and thirsty. We need clothes. We are beaten and we have no home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>We work hard with our hands. People curse us, but we bless them. They trouble us much, but we must take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>They talk behind our backs, but we still try to win them. People treat us as a dirt pile, the rubbish of the world. And they still do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to make you ashamed. But you are my dear children and I want to teach you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>Even if you have ten thousand people to take care of you as Christians, yet you do not have many fathers. I am your Christian father because I brought you the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>So I beg you, do as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>That is why I am sending Timothy to you. I love Timothy very much. He is my Christian son. I can trust him. He will tell you again my Christian ways of living. I teach these same ways in every church meeting everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Some of you are proud of yourselves. You think I am not coming to visit you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come soon if it is the Lords will. Then I will find, not the talk of those proud people, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>The place where God rules is not a matter of talk, but of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>Which do you want? Shall I come to you with a stick to beat you, or shall I come with love and a kind spirit?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>I have heard a very bad report about you. I hear there are wrong sexual ways among you. Even the people who are not Jews do not allow wrong sex such as this among them.  A man is living with his fathers wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>Can it be that you are still proud? This should make you very sad. The man who has done this should be put out of the church meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>My body is not with you, but my spirit is. Just as if I were right there, I have decided what to do about the man who did such a thing as this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>Do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When you meet together my spirit will be with you. Then, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, give this man over to Satan. Let Satan punish his body. By this the mans spirit may yet be saved when the Lord Jesus comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>Surely it is not right for you to be proud. Do you not know that only a little yeast in the bread will make all the bread rise?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Clean out the old yeast so that you will become like new bread. You are free from the old things. Christ, the Passover Lamb, has been killed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Let us then remember the feast of Passover and have our bread. But let us not have our feast with old yeast in the bread. To do bad and wrong things is like that old yeast. But let us have it with new bread that has no old yeast in it. To be honest and true is like the new bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>I wrote a letter to you. I told you not to be friends with people who use sex the wrong way &lt;FI&gt;with a person they are not married to&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I did not mean the people of the world &lt;FI&gt;people who are not Christians&lt;Fi&gt; -some of them use sex the wrong way; or always want more things; or steal; or worship idols. To keep away from them altogether would mean you would have to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>But I wrote to you not to be friends with anyone who says he is a Christian and uses wrong sex, or always wants more, or has idols, or curses, or drinks too much strong drink, or steals. I told you not even to sit down to eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>Why should I judge the people who are outside the church? You are to judge the church people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>God judges those who are outside. The holy writings say, Send the bad person away from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>When one of you has some complaint against a Christian brother, why does he take him to be judged by those who are not Christians? Why does he not take him to Gods people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that some day Gods people will judge the world? If you are going to judge the world, can you not judge small things now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we shall judge angels? Then we should surely be able to judge things in this life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>So if you have complaints about things in this life, why do you take them to those who are not church people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>Shame on you! Are none of you wise enough to judge between two Christian brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But now one Christian brother takes another Christian brother to be judged by people who are not Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>It is wrong for you to take each other to court at all. You should be willing to take wrong.  It would be better to lose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>Instead, you are doing wrong to your own Christian brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that bad people will have no part in the kingdom where God rules? Do not be fooled. There are some people who will not have part in that place. They are those who commit adultery of any kind, those who have idols, or steal, or are always wanting more, or talk wrong things about people, or drink plenty of strong drink, or take things by force, or curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>Some of you were like that. But now you have been washed and made holy. The Spirit of our God has made you right by the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>I am free to do anything I want, but some things are not good for me to do. I am free to do anything, but I will not become a slave of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the body, and the body is for food. But God will bring both to an end. The body is not made to be used for wrong sex behaviour, but for the Lord. And the Lord is for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>God raised up the Lord and he will also raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies belong to Christ? Shall I take parts of Christ and join them to a bad woman? No, never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do you not know that the person who joins himself to a bad woman becomes one person with her? The holy writings say, The two people shall be like one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But the one who joins himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Run away from every kind of wrong sex! Every other wrong thing which a person does is done outside of his body. But the person who uses sex the wrong way does a wrong thing to his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Do you not know that your body is the house of the Holy Spirit who lives in you? God gave the Holy Spirit to you. Remember, you do not belong to yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>But you were bought and paid for. So then, bring glory to God with your bodies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>You wrote me a letter. Here is my answer to the things in the letter. It is good if a man has nothing to do with a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But wrong sex is always a danger to us. So it is better for each man to have his own wife and each woman to have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband should give his wife what is right. So also, the wife should give her husband what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have full right over her own body. But her husband has a right to it. In the same way, the husband does not have full right over his own body. But his wife has a right to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not keep from the other what is right for them to have. It is all right to stay from each other for a while, if you both agree to it. Then you will have time for prayer. Afterwards,  come together again. If you do not, Satan might tempt you to do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>I say you may do this. I do not say that you must do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish that all men were like I am. But God has made everyone different. One man can live one way and another man can live another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>Here is what I say to those who are not married and to those whose husbands are dead.  It is good for them to stay the way I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot keep themselves under control, then they should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with desire for sex.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>And here is what I say to those who are married. (And yet it is not what I say. It is what the Lord has said.) The wife may not leave her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>But if she does leave him, she must not marry again, or she must come back to her husband again. And the husband may not send away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>Here is what I say to other people. (This is my word, not the Lords.) Perhaps a Christian brother has a wife who is not a Christian. If she wants to stay with him, then he should not send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>Perhaps a woman has a husband who is not a Christian. If he wants to stay with her, then the woman should not leave him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>The husband who is not a Christian is made holy by the wife. And the wife who is not a Christian is made holy by the husband. If this were not so, then your children would not be holy. But they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>If the one who is not a Christian really wants to leave, let him go. The Christian husband or wife is free then. God has called us to live in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>Wife, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your husband to the Lord. Husband, you do not know. Perhaps you will win your wife to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Only let me say this. Every man should go on living in the way which the Lord chooses for him. He should go on as he was when God called him to be a Christian. I say this to people in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>If a man was already circumcised when God called him, he should not try to change the marks of it. If a man was not circumcised when God called him, he should not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>It does not matter whether one is circumcised or not. The thing that matters is doing what God says we must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Everyone should stay the way he was when God called him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>If you were a slave when God called you, do not let that trouble you. But if there is some way for you to get free, then do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>If a man was a slave when the Lord called him, he is the Lords free man. So also if a man was free when he was called, he is Christs slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought and paid for. Do not become slaves of men!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>So, Christian brothers, everyone should go on living as he was when God called him. But now he lives with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Here is what I say about those who are not married. (I have no law from the Lord about this. But here is what I think. You can trust me because the Lord has helped me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I think that, since there is now trouble in the world, it is good for each one to stay as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>If you have married a wife, do not try to be free from her. If you have no wife, do not look for one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But, if you marry, it is not wrong. And if a woman marries, it is not wrong. People who marry will have trouble in this life. And I want to keep you out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>Here, my brothers, is what I mean. The time is short. In the time that is left, men who have wives should live as though they did not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>People who cry should live as though they were not sad. People who laugh should live as though they were not glad. People who buy things should live as though they did not own them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>And people who are busy with things in this world should not be too busy. The world as we see it is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>I want your minds to be free. The man who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. He tries to please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the man who is married thinks about the things of this world. He tries to please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>In the same way, there is a difference between the woman who is married and the one who is not. The woman who is not married thinks about the things of the Lord. She wants her body and her spirit to be holy. But the married woman thinks about the things of this life. She tries to please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>I say this to help you, not to make it hard for you. I want to show you what is good. I do not want anything to stop you from serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>And if a man feels that he is doing the right thing for the woman he is to marry, then let him marry her. That is, if she is no longer young, and if he wants her very much. Then he must do as he thinks best. It is not wrong for him to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But the man who has made up his mind not to marry his woman will do well. That is, if he does not have to marry her, and is able to control himself, and if he is sure about it in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So the man who marries his woman will do what is good. But the man who does not marry her will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife may not leave her husband as long as he is living. But if he dies, she is free to marry any man she wants. Only this, he must be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But I think that she is happier if she stays as she is and does not marry again. (I think too that I am saying what the Spirit of God wants me to say in this matter.)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now here is what I say about food given to idols. We all know something about this matter. Yet knowledge makes us proud. Love is the real teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>If anyone thinks he knows much, then he does not know what he really should know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if anyone loves God, then God knows him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>So here is what I say about eating food that has been given to idols or false gods. We know that an idol really is nothing in this world. There is only one true and living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.5'>There are things in the sky and on earth which are called gods. Yes, there are many gods and lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.6'>Yet for us there is only one God. He is the Father. All things come from him. He is the one for whom we live. And there is only one Lord. He is Jesus Christ. He made all things.  He is the one who gives us life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>But not every Christian knows these things. Some of them have always believed in idols.  And when they eat food which has been given to an idol, they think the food belongs to the idol. And because they are weak Christians they feel they do wrong when they eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>One thing is sure, food will not bring us closer to God. If we eat it, it will not make us right with God. And if we do not eat, it will not make us wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>Perhaps you feel it is all right for you to do it. But be careful! It might make the weak Christian do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>You know it is not wrong for you to eat these things. But if a weak Christian sees you eating in the idols house, he will also want to eat food that has been given to an idol. He will do what is against his own belief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>You know the truth, and yet your knowledge will make your weak brother do wrong.  You have hurt the faith of a brother, for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>In this way you do wrong to your brother. You hurt him because he is weak. And in so doing you do wrong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>If eating such food makes my brother do wrong, I will never eat it. I do not want my brother to do wrong.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.1'>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you people not proof of the work I do for the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.2'>If other people do not call me an apostle, yet surely I am an apostle to you. You people are the proof that I am an apostle for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.3'>Here is what I say to the people who say wrong things about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.4'>Do we not have the right to eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.5'>Do we not have the right to have a Christian wife with us as do the other apostles, and the brothers of our Lord, and Cephas?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.6'>Must Barnabas and I work for our living though the other apostles do not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.7'>What soldier pays for his own food when he goes to war? Who plants a garden and does not eat what grows in it? Who takes care of animals and does not get any of the milk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.8'>Am I saying only what men say? Does not Gods law also say the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.9'>Moses wrote in his books of the law of God, Do not tie shut the mouth of an ox when it is treading the grain. Does God care about the oxen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Does he not say this altogether for our sakes? Yes, he said it for our sakes. There are people who plough the ground and beat the grain. They do this work because they believe they will have a part of the food for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.11'>We have planted seed by teaching you the good things of the Spirit. So we should receive something from you to help us to pay for our living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.12'>If it is right for other teachers to receive something from you, then we have more of a right to receive it. But we did not use our right. Instead, we do anything we can so that we will not stop the good news of Christ from going out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.13'>You know there are men who do the work in the temple. They get their food from the temple. Those who help to make sacrifices in the temple get a part of the sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.14'>It is the same with those who work telling the good news. The Lord said they should get their living from that work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>And I am not writing this to ask you to do these things for me. I would rather die! It is something I am proud of, and no one shall take it away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>My telling the good news is not something for me to be proud of. It is something I must do. Yes, it would be very, very wrong for me if I did not tell the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.17'>If I do it because I want to do it, I get my pay. But if I do not want to do it, it is still my duty to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.18'>So what is my pay? My pay is to tell the good news and not be paid for it! That is why I do not use my right to take pay for telling the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.19'>Even though I am no ones slave, yet I have made myself a slave to everyone. I have done this so that I might win more people to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.20'>When I was with the Jews, I lived like the Jews, so that I might win the Jews to Christ. I was not under the law. But I lived as if I was under the law of the Jews. I did this so that I might win to Christ those who are under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.21'>When I was with those who do not have the law of the Jews, I lived as if I did not have the law of the Jews. I did this so that I might win them also. Of course, I myself have laws. I follow the laws of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>When I was with weak people, I lived like a weak person. I did this so that I might win weak people to Christ. I lived like all kinds of people to save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.23'>I do all this for the good news, so that I also will have some of its blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.24'>You know when people are running a race, they all run. But only one man will win. The way you should run is to run to win.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.25'>Everyone who wants to show his strength must control himself in every way. They do it for a prize that will spoil. But what we do, we do for a reward that will never, never spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.26'>So I do not run as if I did not know where I was going. And I do not fight like a man just beating the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.27'>But I control my own body really well. I make my body obey me. After telling others the good news, I myself do not want to be left out.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.1'>My brothers, here is something you should know. Long ago, all our fathers were led by the cloud of God over them. They all went through the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.2'>It was as if they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.3'>They all ate the same food from the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.4'>They all drank the same water sent by the Spirit. The water they drank came from a Rock of the Spirit which went with them. That Rock was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.5'>But God was not pleased with most of them. They died in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.6'>This teaches us not to want wrong things as they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.7'>Do not worship idols, as some of them did. The holy writings say, The people sat down to eat and drink. Then they got up and danced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.8'>We must not use sex the wrong way as some of them did. Twenty-three thousand people died in one day!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.9'>We must not test the Lord, as some of them did. They were bitten by bad snakes and died!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.10'>Do not grumble, as some of them did. They were killed by the Angel of Death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.11'>These things happened to them to teach other people. They were written in the holy writings to teach us who are living in the last days of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.12'>Therefore, when a person thinks, I am strong; I can stand, let that person be careful, or he will fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.13'>No testing has come to you that other people do not have. But God will not fail you. He will not allow the testing to be too hard for you. No. When the testing comes, God will make a way out for you, so that you can go through the testing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.14'>So then, my dear brothers, do not worship idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.15'>I talk to you as people with good sense. Decide for yourselves about what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.16'>We ask God to bless the cup at the Lords supper. When we drink from this cup it means that the blood of Christ is for us all. We break the bread. When we eat this bread, it means that the body of Christ is for us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.17'>The bread is all one loaf. In the same way, we are many people but we are one body. We all eat from the same loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.18'>See what the Jews do. Those who eat the sacrifices all eat things that are sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.19'>What do I mean by saying this? Is the food that has been given to idols really something holy? Or is an idol really something like God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.20'>No. What I mean is this. Those people give the food to bad spirits and not to God. I do not want you to have anything to do with bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.21'>You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of bad spirits. You cannot eat food at the table of the Lord and at the table of bad spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.22'>Do we want to make the Lord jealous? Are we stronger than he is? No!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.23'>We are free to do anything we want to do. Yes, but some things do not make people better. It is better if we do not do such things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.25'>Eat any meat that is sold at the market. Do not ask any questions about it because you think, Is it wrong to eat it?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.27'>If one who is not a believer asks you to come and eat, if you want to go, then eat the food he gives you. Do not ask any questions about it because you fear it might be wrong to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.28'>But if anyone says to you, This food has been given to an idol, then do not eat it. Do not eat it because of the one who told you and because it might seem wrong. I mean it might seem wrong, not to you, but to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.29'>Since I am free, is it wrong for me to eat just because someone else thinks it is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.30'>I thank God for my food. So why should anyone say it is wrong for me to eat what I thank God for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.31'>So, whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to bring praise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.32'>Do nothing that will make Jews, or Greeks, or those who belong to the church of God,  turn away from God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.3'>But I want you to know this. Christ is the head of every man. The husband is the head of the wife. And God is the head of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.4'>Any man who talks to God or speaks words from God with his head covered brings shame on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.5'>But any woman who talks to God or speaks words from God with her head not covered brings shame on her head. She is just the same as a woman who has cut off all her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.6'>If a woman does not cover her head, she might as well cut off her hair. But if it is a shame for a woman to cut off her hair, or to shave her head, then she should have her head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.7'>A man does not need to cover his head because he was made like God is. Man is Gods glory. Woman is mans glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.8'>Man was not made from woman, but woman was made from man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.9'>And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.10'>She should show this by having her head covered, because of the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.11'>But the Lord did not make woman without man, and he did not make man without woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.12'>As woman comes from man, so man is born by woman. And everything comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.13'>What do you think? Does it look right for a woman to talk to God in public with her head not covered?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.15'>But long hair is something for the woman to be proud of. Her hair has been given to her for a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.16'>Does anyone still want to quarrel about this matter? This is what we do. And this is what the churches of God do also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.17'>In the next thing I have to talk about, I cannot say that you are doing well. Your meeting together is more bad than good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.18'>First, I hear that in the church meeting you divide yourselves into groups. I think this may be true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.19'>You also have groups of people who do not think the same way. Because of them you will soon learn which people please God the most.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.20'>When you meet together, it is not the Lords supper that you eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.21'>People take their own food and eat it without waiting. One gets nothing to eat. Another person drinks too much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.22'>Do you not have your own homes where you can eat and drink? Do you have no respect for the church of God? Do you want to make poor people ashamed? What shall I say to you? Shall I say you are doing well? No, you are not doing well in this matter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.23'>The Lord gave me what I taught you. This is what it was. On the night when the Lord Jesus was sold to his enemies, he took bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.24'>He thanked God for it. Then he broke it and said, Take this bread and eat it. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this so that you will remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.25'>In the same way, after they had eaten, he took the cup. He said, This cup is the new agreement made by my blood. Every time you drink from this cup, do it to remember me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.26'>Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you tell about the Lords death,  until he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.27'>So then, when anyone eats the bread and drinks from the cup in a way that is not right,  he has done wrong to the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>Each one must look into his own heart carefully. When he has done that, he may eat the bread and drink from the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.29'>The person who eats and drinks in a wrong way will be punished. He does not take it as the Lords body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>So, my Christian brothers, when you come together to eat the Lords supper, wait on your turn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>If a man is hungry, he should eat at home. Then when you meet, you will not be found in the wrong. There are other matters. I will talk about them when I come to see you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now, my Christian brothers, I want you to know something about the gifts given by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that before you believed in God, you were led by other men to believe in idols that could not talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore, I want you to understand this. No person who has the Spirit of God ever curses Jesus. And no one can say, Jesus is Lord, if he is not controlled by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>There are different gifts, but there is only one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>There are different kinds of work, but there is only one Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>There are different ways of working, but there is only one God. He works in all people and does it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>And the Holy Spirit gives each one a gift so that all people may be helped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>The Spirit gives one person wise words to say. The same Spirit gives another person words of good understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>To another person the same Spirit gives faith, and to another person he gives the power to heal people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>To another person the Spirit gives the power to do big works. Another can speak words from God. To another person he gives the power to know the difference between spirits.  To another person he gives the gift to speak the words of God in other tongues or languages, and to another the meaning of these different tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>And the same Spirit gives the power for all these things. He gives each person what he wants to give to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>A person has only one body, and the body has many parts. It is the same with Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>The one Spirit baptized us all to make one body. It made no difference whether we were Jews or Greeks, whether we were slaves or free men. We were all given to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>I say again, the body is not all one part, but has many parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>Perhaps the foot says, I am not the hand, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>Perhaps the ear says, I am not the eye, so I do not belong to the body. But it is still a part of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If all of the body were an eye, how could we hear? If all the body were an ear, how could we smell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>The way it is now, God has put each part in the body in the place he wanted it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>If they were all one part, how could it be a body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>The way it is now, there are many parts, but it is one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>The eye cannot say to the hand, I do not need you. And the head cannot say to the feet,  I do not need you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>No, that is not so. Some parts of the body are not as strong as others. Yet we could not live without them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And we look after some parts of our body more than others because they need it. The parts of our body that are not so fine in one way are made more fine in other ways. But the parts which are fine already do not need to be made fine. God made the body and has given more care to the parts that need it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>He did this so that the body would not be divided into groups, but all the parts would help each other. 26)If one part has trouble, then all the other parts are troubled too. If one part is praised, then all the other parts are glad with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>Now, all of you together are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>God has given each person their right place in the church. First, there are the apostles.  Second, there are prophets who speak words from God. Third, there are those who teach. Then there are those who do big works. Then there are those who have the gifts to heal people, those who help in the work of the church people, those who lead and guide others, and those who speak Gods words in different kinds of tongues or languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Are all the people apostles? Can they all speak words from God? Can they all teach? Can they all do big works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>Do they all have the gifts to heal the sick people? Can they all speak in different tongues?  Can they all tell the meaning of these tongues?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>You should seek after the best gifts. But I will show you a way that is much better than any of them!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>If I speak words from God, if I can understand all secrets, and know everything, if I can move mountains by believing, but if I do not love people, I am nothing, even though I can do all of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>If I give away all I have, and if I give my body to be burned, but if I do not love people, I get nothing out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Love does not do things that are not nice. Love does not just think of itself. Love does not get angry. Love holds no wrong feelings in the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Love is not glad when people do wrong things. But it is always glad when they do right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>Love forgives everything. Love is always trusting, and always hoping, and never gives up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never ends. The gift of speaking words from God will end. The gift of speaking in different tongues or languages will stop. The gift of knowing many things will end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>Now we know only a little, and we can speak only a little of Gods words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when everything becomes perfect, that part will come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I talked like a child. I understood like a child. I thought like a child.  But when I became a man, I stopped doing things like a child.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Love is the thing you should want more than anything else. But you should also want other things the Spirit gives. You should want very much to be able to speak words from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>The person who talks in tongues of a different language does not talk to people, but to God. People do not understand what he says. But he is saying secret things by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But the person who is a prophet speaks words from God to people plainly. He helps them to believe and to be strong, and he comforts them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>The person who talks in a different tongue helps himself. But the one who tells forth Gods word helps all the people in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I wish that you could all talk in different tongues. But I want even more that you should speak words from God for all to hear and understand. The person who speaks words from God is greater than the person who talks in tongues-unless he is able to tell the meaning of his words, so that he helps all the people in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>My brothers, if I come to you and talk in tongues of a different language, how can I help you? I cannot help you if I do not tell you something God has shown to me, or something I know, or Gods word, or some teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Such things as horns or harps have no life, but they make sounds. Now if they dont make the right noise, no one will know what the sound means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>If the war drum gives a sound that has no meaning, then no one will get ready to fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>If you say words that people cannot understand, they will not know what you say. You talk for nothing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are no doubt many different languages in the world. And every one of them has a meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>But if a person talks in a language and I do not know the meaning of it, I will be like a stranger to him and he will be like a stranger to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So it is with you. You want the gifts of the Spirit. Then you should want the gift which will make you better able to help the church people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>So then, the person who talks in a tongue of a different language, should ask God to help tell the meaning of the tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>If I pray to God in a tongue of a different language, then I am talking with my spirit, but I do not use my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then shall I do? I will talk to God with my spirit and I will talk to God with my mind.  I will sing with my spirit and I will sing with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>If you thank God with your spirit only, an ordinary person cannot say, Amen, it is so!  He does not know what you say.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I can talk in tongues more than any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>But in the church meeting it is better for me to say five words with my mind, so that I will teach other people also. This is better than to say ten thousand words in a tongue of a different language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>My brothers, do not be like children in your thinking. When it comes to doing wrong things, be like small babies. But in your thinking be grown up people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>The holy writings say, I will talk to these people by strangers and by people who talk in strange tongues. And yet, they will not listen to me. This is what the Lord says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then, tongues are a sign to people who do not believe God. They are not a sign to those who believe him. But speaking words from God like a prophet is a sign to those who believe. It is not a sign to those who do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>Sometimes all the people of the church may be gathered together. If everyone talks in tongues, and if some people who do not know or believe come in, they will say that you are crazy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But what happens if everyone speaks words from God? If such people come in, then the words from God will prove to them that they have done wrong. They will all speak to the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>Such a person sees everything that has been hidden in his heart. Then he will kneel down and worship God. He will say, It is true. God is here among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What shall we do about it, my brothers? When you meet together, every one of you has something to help the other. One has a song to sing. One has something to teach people.  One has something which God has shown to him. One has something to say in a tongue.  One can tell the meaning of a tongue. Do all of these things to help one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any people talk in a tongue, only two or not more than three should talk. They must talk one at a time and someone must tell the meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no one to tell the meaning, a person must not talk in a tongue of a different language in the church meeting. He should talk to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Two or three prophets may speak words from God and the others should say what they think about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if another person is sitting by and God gives him something to say, then the first person should stop talking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>One by one you may speak words from God. In that way, all will learn something and all will be stronger in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>Those who speak words from God are able to keep their own spirits quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>God does not want things to be out of order. He wants peace in the church meeting. In all the churches of Gods people, the women should be quiet in the church meetings. They must not be allowed to talk. They must obey. The holy writings say this also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If the women want to know something, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is a shame for a woman to talk in a church meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Do you think that you were the first ones to tell the word of God? Or do you think that you are the only people who have it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>Perhaps someone thinks, I am the one to speak words from God, or, I have the Spirit.  Then know this, the Lord has told me to write these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>If anyone does not know this, then God will not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So, my brothers, the thing you should want is to speak words from God. But at the same time, do not stop anyone from talking in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>But everything should be done in the right way and in good order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now, my brothers, I want to bring the good news to your minds again. I told it to you and you received it. You now believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>You are saved by it, if you hold on to what I told you. If you do not, then you have believed for nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>I told you first what was told to me. I told you that Christ died for the wrong things we did, as the holy writings said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>He was buried. He was raised on the third day, as the holy writings said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>Peter saw him, and then all the twelve disciples saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that, more than five hundred Christian brothers saw him at one time. Most of them are still living, but some have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that, James saw him. Then all the apostles saw him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Last of all, I saw him too. I was like one who was born at the wrong time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>The other apostles are all greater than I am. I should not be called an apostle because I troubled the people of Gods church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But God has been kind to me. He has made me what I am today. And he did not bless me for nothing. I did more work than any of them. Yet it was not I, but the loving kindness of God was working with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>So it does not matter who gave the message, they or I. This is the message we gave, and this is the message you believed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>If dead people do not rise, Christ did not rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ did not rise, then what we told you was not true, and what you believe is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>If this were so, we would have been telling lies about God, because we said that God raised up Christ. He did not raise up Christ if dead people are not raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>If dead people are not raised, then Christ was not raised either.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>It was a man who first brought death. So it was also a man who was first raised from death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Wake up! Do what is right. Stop doing wrong things. Some of you do not know God at all. I say these things to you to make you ashamed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>What foolish questions! The seed you put in the ground must die before it can come to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>You do not put a grown-up plant in the ground. You put in a seed, such as corn, wheat,  rice, or something like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>God gives the seed the body he wants it to have. He gives a different kind of body to every kind of seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>Not all living bodies are alike. People have one kind of body. Animals have another kind of body. Fish another kind of body. Birds have another kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>So too, there are bodies for the sky and bodies for the earth. The bodies for the sky are fine in one way, and the bodies for the earth are fine in another way. They are not alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>The sun is fine in one way. The moon is fine in another way. The stars are fine in still another way. And one star is fine in a different way from another star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So it is with the body that is raised from death. When it is put in the ground it is a body that dies. When it rises from death, it will never die again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>When it is put in the ground, it is not fine. When it rises, it is very fine. When it is put in the ground it has no strength. When it rises it is strong.</verse>
