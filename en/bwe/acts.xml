        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Acts'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>Theophilus, in the first book I wrote to you, I wrote about all the things Jesus began to do and to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>He did those things until the day he was taken up to heaven. Before he went up, he gave orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>In many ways he proved to them that he was living again after his terrible death. For forty days they often saw him. Then he told them things about Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>One day when he was eating with them, he told them not to leave Jerusalem. He said,  Wait here for what the Father promised you. I have told you about that promise already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>John baptised with water. But you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit when a few days have passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>When they had come together, the apostles asked Jesus, Lord, are you now going to set up the kingdom of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He answered them, You will not know the days or the months which the Father has chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will receive power. You will speak of me in Jerusalem and all around in Judea and Samaria and everywhere in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When Jesus had said this, he went up. They watched him going. Then a cloud hid him,  and they did not see him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While they were looking at the sky as he went up, two men stood by them in white clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>They said, You men from Galilee, why do you stand there looking at the sky? Jesus has gone up into heaven. In the same way that you saw him go up, he will come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they left the hill called the Mount of Olives. They went back to Jerusalem which was not far away. (It was how far the law said people may walk on the Sabbath day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they reached Jerusalem, they went to a room up in a house. Here lived Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon the freedom fighter, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All of these people were talking to God. The women, Jesus mother Mary, and Jesus  brothers were there talking to God also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>About one hundred and twenty people were gathered together. Peter stood up among them to speak to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>He said, My friends and brothers, Judas showed the people where Jesus was so they could take him. The Holy Spirit spoke through king David long ago about Judas before he did it. What was written about him has now happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>Judas was one of us. He had his part of the work to do. (</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>Judas received money for the wrong thing he did. He bought a field with the money and fell on his face. His belly burst open and all his insides came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this. In their language they named the field Akeldama, which means The Field of Blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>The book of Psalms says, "His house must be empty. No one may live in it." And it also says, "Someone else must do his work."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Here are men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>They were with us from the time John baptised people until the day Jesus was taken up from us. One of these men must help us tell people that Jesus was raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>They took two men. One was Joseph, named Barsabbas, who had another name Justus.  The other man was Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>Then the people talked to God. They said, Lord, you know what is in everybodys heart.  Show us which of these two men you have chosen to have a part in this work and to be an apostle. For Judas left this work and went to the place where he belonged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they picked out the name of Matthias. He was chosen to be with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>On the day of Pentecost these people were all in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>Then, suddenly, a sound came from heaven. It was like a very strong wind blowing. It went all through the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And then they saw tongues like fire. These were divided and came on each one of the people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit. They began to speak the words of God in other languages as the Spirit spoke through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Crowds of Jews were staying in Jerusalem. They had come from every country in the world. They were good men who believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>Many people came together when they heard the apostles speaking. They did not know what to think. Everyone heard someone speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were all very much surprised and said to each other, These men who are speaking,  are they not all from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How is it then that each one of us hears the language of our own country?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>We people from the countries of Parthia and Media and Elam all hear the wonderful things God has done. So also do the people who live in the countries of Mesopotamia,  and in Judea in Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, in Phrygia, and Pamphylia, and in Egypt, and in some parts of Lybia around Cyrene, people from the city of Rome who are now living in Jerusalem, both Jews and those who joined themselves to the Jews, the people from Crete and Arabia. These men from Galilee are speaking in our own languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all very much surprised and could hardly believe it. What does this mean?  they asked each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Other people laughed about it and said, These men have been drinking too much new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Peter stood up with the eleven apostles. He shouted, You men of Judea and all who stay in Jerusalem, listen to me! I will tell you the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>You think that these men are drunk. That is not so. It is only nine oclock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>The thing that has happened is what the prophet Joel told about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>He said, "God says, In the last days I will send my Spirit on all people. I will speak through your sons and daughters. Your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>In those days I will send my Spirit on the men and women who serve me and I will speak through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>In the sky above and on the earth below I will show wonderful signs with blood and fire and clouds of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will be dark and the moon will be like blood. These things will happen before the day of the Lord comes. It will be a great day that will be remembered always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And anyone who calls out to the Lord will be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>You men of Israel, listen to this. God showed you that he was pleased with this man,  Jesus of Nazareth. He proved it by the big works and the wonderful signs which he did by Jesus right here among you people. And you yourselves know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>This same Jesus was given up. You let bad men take him. You let them nail him to a cross and kill him. This is just the way God had planned it. He knew how it would happen. But God raised him back to life. He set him free from the pain of death. Death could not hold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>King David spoke about Jesus long ago. He said, "I saw the Lord before me always. He is at my right hand so that I may not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>That made my heart very happy. It made my tongue sing for joy. And even my body also will rest in peace because you will not leave my body in the grave. You will not let your Holy One die and be spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have shown me the ways of life. You will make me very happy when I am with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>My brothers, I can talk very plainly to you about your father, David. He died and was buried. His grave is still here today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>He was a prophet. He knew that God had promised him that someone born of his family would sit on his chair to rule. That one was Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>David knew what would happen. So he said that Christ would be raised from death.  Christ was not left in the grave. His body was not spoiled. David said all this before it ever happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>And now we all saw it. We are telling people that God raised this Jesus back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>God made him great by making him sit at his right side. God gave him the Holy Spirit as he had promised. So he sent this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>David himself has not gone up into the heavens. What he said was, "The LORD God said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand till I bring your enemies down and put your feet on them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>So let all the people of Israel know this: God has made Jesus to be Lord and Christ. This is the same Jesus whom you nailed to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>What Peter said cut the peoples hearts when they heard it. They knew they had done wrong. They said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God, answered Peter. And then everyone of you can be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. Your wrong ways will be forgiven you,  and you will receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>This promise is for you and your children and for all those whom the Lord our God calls,  even though they are far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>Peter went on talking and teaching the people. Do not follow the wrong ways of people today, he begged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who gladly received his words and believed were baptised. That same day about three thousand new believers joined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They kept on being taught by the apostles. And they kept on being with them. They ate bread together and talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>All the people were very much surprised. Many wonderful things and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All the believers were together; and everything they had was for the use of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They sold their things and divided the money among the believers. They gave each person what he needed. 46,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And every day the believers kept on gathering in the temple. They ate bread in each others homes. They ate their food gladly and with open hearts. They praised God. All the people respected them. Day by day, the Lord added to the church those who were saved.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>One day at three oclock, Peter and John went to the temple to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>There was a man who had been born lame. He was carried and was laid at the gate of the temple every day. The gate was called Beautiful. He was brought there to beg. He asked for money from the people who went into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>This man saw Peter and John ready to go into the temple. He begged them to give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter and John looked at him. Peter said, Look at us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>The man looked at them. He thought they would give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Then Peter said, I have no money. But I will give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>He took the mans right hand and raised him up. Right away his feet and ankles became strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>He jumped to his feet and walked into the temple with them. He was so happy he jumped around and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>And they knew that this was the man who sat begging at the temple gate which was called Beautiful. They were very much surprised at what had happened to him. They could hardly believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While the man still held on to Peter and John, all the people came running to them. It was in the part of the temple which is called Solomons porch. They were still very excited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When Peter saw this, he talked to the people. He said, Men of Israel, why are you so surprised at this? Do you think that we have power or are good enough to make this man walk? Why do you look at us that way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and of our fathers, has made his Son Jesus great.  You gave him up to Pilate. You did not want to believe who he was. You did not want him back when Pilate agreed to let him go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You would not receive the one who was holy and good. You asked for a bad man, who killed people, to be given to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>You killed the one who gives life, the one whom God brought back from death. We saw it and are telling people about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>This man whom you see and know, believed in the name of Jesus Christ. This mans faith in that name has healed him. Yes, believing in Jesus Christ has made him well here in front of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>My brothers, I know that you and your rulers killed Jesus because you did not understand what you were doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But in this way God did what he had told us would happen. Through all the prophets he had told us that Christ would suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Stop doing wrong things. Turn to God again. Then the wrong things you have done will be wiped away altogether. The Lord will give you a new start and make you very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>He will send you Jesus. He was the one God chose to be the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>But he must wait in heaven until the time when all things will be made new again as they were at first. By his holy prophets God spoke of all this from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses himself said, "The Lord God will raise up for you a Prophet like me. He will be one of your brothers. You must listen to everything that the Prophet says to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And everyone who does not obey that Prophet will be cut off from his people altogether."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Prophets spoke at the time of Samuel, and prophets spoke after that time. They all have told about these days also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the people who have received what the prophets promised. And you have received the agreement which God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham,  "Through your children all the nations of the earth will receive blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>God raised up and sent his Son to you first to bless you. He blesses you when each one of you stops doing wrong things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>Peter and John were talking to the people. The priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people. They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They caught them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God, believed what they said.  The number of men who believed was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next day their rulers, leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all of the high priests family were there also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>Peter and John were brought before them. They asked the apostles, By what power or in what name have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel, have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man? Do you want to find out how he was healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>Well, let it be known by all the people of Israel. This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He has done this. You nailed him to a cross, but God raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>Jesus Christ is the stone which you, the builders, would not use. But he is now the chief corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>No one else can save us. Of all the people in the world, God chose him to save us. It is by him we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out. They knew that they were like any other men. They did not have much training. So the people were very much surprised. They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them. So they could say nothing against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>They told Peter and John to leave the court. Then they talked the matter over among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>They said, What shall we do to these men? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done. And we cannot say they did not do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But we do not want any more people to hear about it. So let us say to these men, "Take care! Never speak to anyone in this name again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>They called them in and said, Never speak or teach in this name again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them, How does God look at it? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him? You judge that for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>As for us, we must tell the things we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So the high priest and those with him told them again. Then they let them go. They could not punish them because of the people. They all praised God for what had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>The man who had been healed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>When they were free, Peter and John went back to their own friends. They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>When they heard it, they talked to God together. They said, Lord, you are God. You made the sky, and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>Our father David was your servant. Through him you said by the Holy Spirit, "Why are the people who are not Jews so angry? And why do the people plan things for nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth joined their forces. And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city. They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus, whom you made Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>But they only did what you had already planned should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Lord, hear their words. Listen to the wrong things they say against us. We are your servants. Help us to speak your word without fear. And heal the sick by your own power.  Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had talked to God, the room they were in shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. And they spoke the word of God without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>All the believers were one in heart and mind. Not one of them said, This is mine. But everything they had was for the use of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death. And God blessed them all very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>None of them was in need of anything. Those who owned fields and houses sold them.  They brought the money to the apostles. Then the apostles gave each one what he needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>There was a man named Joseph, a Levite. He was born in the country of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. That means "one who helps."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>He had a field and sold it. He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>A man named Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, sold a field. He brought some of the money to the apostles. But he kept the rest of it. His wife knew what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart? Why do you lie to the Holy Spirit?  You have kept some of the money which you got for the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>As long as you had the field, it belonged to you. When you had the money, you could do what you wanted to do with it. Why then did you plan to do a thing like this? You have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>As Ananias heard Peters words, he fell down and died. All who heard these things were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>The young men came and wrapped him up. They carried him out and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>About three hours later, his wife came in. She did not know what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Peter asked her, Tell me, did you sell the field for so much money? and she answered,  Yes, that is how much it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, Why did you two agree together to test the Spirit of the Lord?  Listen, I hear the footsteps of the men who buried your husband. They are at the door.  They will carry you out too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And she fell down at Peters feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead. They carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>Then all the church people, and all the people who heard about this were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>The apostles did many signs and wonderful things for the people who met together in the place called Solomons porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>Other people feared to join them, but they spoke well of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>Many more men and women believed and came to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>They brought sick people out into the streets and laid them on beds and mats. They hoped that at least Peters shadow would touch them as he passed by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>Many people also came from the cities around Jerusalem. They brought others who were sick and those who were controlled by bad spirits. Every one of them was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Some Sadducees were with the high priest. They all became very jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>They caught the apostles and put them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But that night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>Go, said the angel. Stand in the temple and tell the people all about this new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>When the apostles heard that, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught the people there. The high priest and his men came. They called a meeting of the court and all the leaders of the Jews. Then they sent men to the prison to bring the apostles out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>When the men came to the prison, they did not find the apostles there. Then they went back and told the high priest and those with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>They said, The prison was locked very well. And the police were guarding the doors.  But when we opened the doors, no one was inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard this, they did not know what to think. We wonder what will come from all this, they thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Just then someone came and told them, The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went with the men and brought the apostles quietly. They did not bring them by force because they were afraid the people would kill them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>So they brought them in and put them before the court. The high priest asked them, Did we not tell you that you must never teach again in this name? But here you are, teaching people all over Jerusalem in this name. You are trying to put on us the blame for this mans death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Then Peter and the other apostles answered them, We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, the one you killed by hanging on a dead tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God has made him great at his right side. He has made him leader and Saviour. He has done this so that the people of Israel may stop doing wrong things and be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>We know these things are true. So does the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When the judges heard this, they were very, very angry and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>Then a lawyer named Gamaliel stood up in the court. He was a Pharisee and all the people respected him. He asked that the apostles be taken out for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>Then he said, Men of Israel, you had better take care what you plan to do to these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>Before this time, there was a man named Theudas. He tried to make people believe that he was a great man. He had about four hundred followers. He was killed, and all of his followers were scattered, and the whole thing ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>Then after that, at tax time, another man named Judas from Galilee made trouble. Many people followed him. He also was killed and all of his followers were scattered. 38,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>So now, I say, do nothing to these men. Leave them alone. If this is the teaching or work of men, it will come to an end. But if it is of God, you cannot stop these men. You might even be fighting against God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>They agreed to do what he said. They called in the apostles and had them beaten. They told them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>The apostles left the court. They were very glad to think that God let them be punished for the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>Every day, in the temple and in homes, they kept on teaching and talking about Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>At that time more and more people joined the disciples. Then there was trouble about a certain matter. The Jews who spoke the Greek language complained against the other Jews. They said that each day when the food was being divided, their women whose husbands were dead did not get their part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>Then the twelve apostles called all of the disciples together. They said, It is not right for us to stop preaching Gods word to divide the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>So then, brothers, you choose seven men who you know are good men. Choose men who are full of the Holy Spirit and are wise. We will give them the work to divide the food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>But we ourselves will keep on talking with God and telling his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>This pleased all the people. The men they chose were Stephen, a man who believed God and was full of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus from Antioch who had joined the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>These men were brought before the apostles. When the apostles had talked with God,  they put their hands on their heads &lt;FI&gt;to bless them&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>The word of God spread further and further, and many people in Jerusalem believed.  Many of the priests also believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>Stephen received much blessing and power from God. He did many wonderful things and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But some of the Jews argued with Stephen, and said he was wrong. (They belonged to the meeting place of the Free Men. They were Jews who came from Cyrene, Alexandria,  Cilicia and Asia Minor.) They did not agree with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>But they could not say anything against his wise words and the Spirit by whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>So they paid some people to say, We have heard him say wrong things about Moses and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>They talked to the people, the leaders, and the scribes, and made them angry. They went quickly and caught Stephen and took him into the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>They brought in the men who told lies about him. They said, This man is always saying wrong things about this holy place and the laws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will break down this place and that he will change the law which Moses gave us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>Then all the judges who sat in the court looked at him and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the high priest asked, Is this true?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>Stephen replied, Men, brothers and fathers, listen to me. When our father Abraham was in the country of Mesopotamia, before he lived in the country of Haran, the God who is great and wonderful came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>God said, "Leave your country and your family and come to the country that I will show you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then Abraham came out of the country of the Chaldeans and lived for a while in the country of Haran. After his father died, God led him from there to this country where you are living now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>But God did not give any of the land to Abraham, not even a small part. But he promised that the land would belong to him. After him it would belong to his children, even though he did not have a child then.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>This is what God told Abraham. He told him that his children would travel and live in another land. They would be slaves to the people there. They would have a hard time for four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>And God said, "I will judge the people who make them slaves. After that, they will come out of that land and serve me here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>God made the agreement of circumcision with Abraham. Abraham had a son Isaac. He made the mark of circumcision on the childs body and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac had a son Jacob, and Jacob had twelve sons who were our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>Because they were jealous, they sold Joseph to be a slave in the country of Egypt. But God was with Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>He took him out of all his troubles. He blessed him and made him wise in the eyes of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh made him president in Egypt and a ruler over all the people of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>For a long, long time there was no rain in Egypt and Canaan. And so there was very little food. This caused much trouble. Our fathers had nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>Then Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt. He sent his sons on their first trip to buy some. They were our fathers of long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>The second time they went, Joseph told his brothers who he was. And Pharaoh found out who Josephs family was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.14'>Then Joseph sent for Jacob his father and all the family to come. There were seventy-five people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.15'>So Jacob went to Egypt. There he and our fathers died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>They were taken back to the place called Shechem and buried. Abraham had bought a grave from the family of Hamor in Shechem. He had paid money for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>Then it was almost time for God to do what he had promised to Abraham. The family of Jacob had become very large in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.18'>Then a new king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>This king was not kind to our fathers but he gave them a hard time. They had to put their babies outside to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.20'>Moses was born during that time. He was a very fine baby. For three months he was raised in his own fathers home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.21'>When he was put outside to die, Pharaohs daughter took him. She raised him as her own son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.22'>Moses was taught all the things the Egyptians knew. He knew how to talk and could do great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.23'>When he was forty years old he decided to visit his own family, the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.24'>There he saw one of them being hurt by an Egyptian. So he helped him. He fought for him and knocked down the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.25'>He thought his people would know that God wanted him to make them free. But they did not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.26'>The next day he saw two of his own people fighting and he wanted to make peace. "You are brothers," he said. "Why are you fighting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.27'>But the one who was fighting his neighbour pushed Moses away. He said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.28'>Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>When Moses heard these words, he left Egypt at once. He lived as a stranger in the country of Midian. While he was there, two sons were born to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>When forty years had passed, he was in the wilderness near the hill called Sinai. There he saw fire in a small tree. An angel of the Lord was in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>Moses looked at it. He was very much surprised. He came closer to look at it better.  Then he heard the Lord speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>The Lord said, "I am the God of your fathers. I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob." Moses began to shake. He was afraid to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.33'>Then the Lord said, "Take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.34'>I have looked and seen the trouble my people have in Egypt. I have heard them crying and I have come to make them free. Now come, I will send you to Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>This is the same Moses the people would not accept when they said, "Who made you our ruler and our judge?" This is the one God sent to be their ruler and to make them free when he spoke through the angel in the small tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>It was Moses who led the people out of Egypt. He had done wonderful things and signs there, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>This is the same Moses who said, "God will raise up one of your brothers to be a prophet, as he did me. Listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.38'>This is the same Moses who was with Gods people in the wilderness at the hill called Mount Sinai. He was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers of long ago.It was he who received the words of life to give to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.39'>Our fathers would not obey Moses. They did not want him to lead them. They wished they were back in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.40'>They said to Aaron, "Make gods to lead us. We do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us out of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.41'>They made a young cow at that time and gave sacrifices to this god which was not the true God. They were very happy. What they had made pleased them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.42'>Then God turned away from them. He let them worship the sun, moon, and the many stars in the sky. The prophets of God wrote about it long ago. They said, "You people of Israel, did you sacrifice animals to me forty years in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.43'>You carried the house of the god called Moloch and the star of the god called Rephan.  You made gods of them to worship. I will carry you away to the other side of Babylon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.44'>Our fathers had the tent for the laws of God in the wilderness. It was built the way God showed Moses to make it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.45'>Our fathers brought that tent with them when they came to this country. Joshua was their leader. God put aside the people who lived here first. Our fathers kept that tent with them until the time of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.46'>God blessed David who asked God to let him make a better house for Jacobs God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.47'>But it was Solomon who built a house for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.48'>But even so, God is above all. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands. The prophet says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.49'>"The Lord said, The sky is the big chair from which I rule. I put my feet on the earth. So then, what kind of house will you build for me? Or where will I rest myself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.50'>I have made all these things myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.51'>You hard-hearted people! You have hearts and ears like the people who are not Jews.  You always fight against the Holy Spirit just as your fathers did long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.52'>What did your fathers do to the prophets of God? They made a lot of trouble for every one of them. They killed the ones who told that the Right and True One would come. He is the One you gave up to be killed. You are the killers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.53'>You received the law given by angels, but you have not kept it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.54'>When the men heard what Stephen said, they were very angry. They made noises with their teeth to show they hated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.55'>But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked at the sky and saw the greatness of God. He saw Jesus standing at Gods right side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.56'>Look, he said, I see the sky open. I see the Son of man standing at Gods right hand side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.57'>Then the men shouted. They put their fingers in their ears. All together they ran at Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>They put him out of the city and threw stones at him. (Those who had talked against him laid their clothes down by the feet of a young man named Saul.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.59'>They kept on throwing stones at Stephen. He spoke to God and said, Oh, Lord Jesus,  receive my spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.60'>Then he kneeled down and said in a loud voice, Lord, do not punish them for this wrong thing they are doing, After he said this, he died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>Saul agreed to Stephen being killed. At that time the church people at Jerusalem had much trouble. The church people all went into Judea and Samaria. Only the apostles stayed on at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>Good men buried Stephen. They were very sad because he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>Saul made much trouble for the church people. He went into every house, pulled out men and women, and put them into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>The people who left Jerusalem went all around telling the good news about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>Then Philip went to the city of Samaria and told people about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>And all the people together listened to what Philip said because they heard and saw the big works which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>Many people who were held by bad spirits were made free from them. The spirits came out of them crying loudly. Many other sick people were healed too. People who could not stand, and others who were lame, were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>The people all over the city were very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>But there was one man named Simon, a witch-doctor, who fooled the people of Samaria.  He tried to make people believe that he could do big things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>And all the people, young and old, listened to him. They said, This man is a big power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>He had fooled them for a long time with his work as a witch. That is why they listened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But Philip came and told them about Gods kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ. The people believed him. Then both men and women were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>Simon believed also. When he was baptised, he went with Philip. He was very much surprised when he saw the signs and the big works which were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>Then the apostles at Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria believed Gods word. So they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>When they came to them, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>Until that time, none of the people there had received the Holy Spirit. They had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then the apostles put their hands on the people and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>Simon saw that the people received the Holy Spirit when the apostles put their hands on them. Then he brought money to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>He said, Give me this power, too, so that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>Peter said, May you and your money be destroyed! You thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>You have no part in this matter. You cannot have any of this because God sees that your heart is not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>Stop your wrong ways. Ask the Lord. Perhaps God will forgive you for the wrong things you wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>I see that you are very bitter. Your wrong ways control you all together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>Simon said, Ask the Lord for me, so that none of the things you have talked about will happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>The apostles told the people the word of the Lord. Then they went back to Jerusalem. On the way they told the good news in many villages in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>The angel of the Lord spoke to Philip. Get up, said the angel. Go south to the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza. It is desert there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>So Philip went. He saw a man from the country of Ethiopia. This man was a servant of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopian people. She gave this servant much power. He took care of her money. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>Now he was on his way back. He sat in his carriage reading from the book which was written long ago by Isaiah, the prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>The Spirit of the Lord said to Stephen, Go over to that man in the carriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>So Philip went running to him. He heard him reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.  Do you understand what you are reading? Philip asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>How can I? I have no man to teach me, he answered. He asked Philip to get into the carriage and ride with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>This is what he was reading: He was led as a sheep to be killed. A lamb says nothing while its wool is being cut, so he also says nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>He was put down very low. He was not allowed to have a proper trial. He had no children to follow after him. For his life is taken from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>Then the man from Ethiopia asked Philip, Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about, himself or some other man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip told him about Jesus. He began with what the man read in the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>While they were going along, they came to some water by the road. The man said, See,  here is water. What is there to stop me from being baptised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>Philip answered, If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptised. The man said,  I do believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>The man told the driver to stop. Then both he and Philip went down into the water, and Philip baptised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The man did not see him again, but he went on his way and was very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>Next, Philip came to the town of Azotus. He told the good news in all the cities through which he passed. Then he came to Caesarea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>Saul was still very angry with the Lords disciples. He said he would kill them. He went to the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>He asked him for letters to take to the meeting places at Damascus. In this way he was given the power to catch any men or women disciples. He could tie them and bring them back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>He went on his way. All at once, near the city of Damascus, a light from the sky shone around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>He fell to the ground and heard someone say, Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>Saul said, Who are you, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus. You are troubling me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But get up and go to the city. There you will be told what you must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>The men who had come with Saul stood there. They did not say a word. They heard a voice but did not see anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Saul got up off the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was blind. They took his hand and led him to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>For three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>A disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus. The Lord came to him in a vision and said.  Ananias. He replied, Here I am, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said, Go into the street which is called Straight. At the house of Judas, ask for a man named Saul, from the city of Tarsus. He is there, talking with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming to him. He has seen him put his hands on him so that he may see again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>Then Ananias replied, Lord, often I have heard of this man. He has brought much trouble to your people at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>The chief priests have given him power in this city to put into prison all those who call on your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>The Lord said, Go, I have chosen him to take my name to the people who are not Jews,  to kings, and to the people of Israel also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>I will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Then Ananias went. He went into the house and put his hands on Saul. He said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus came to you on the road while you were coming here. He has sent me to you so that you may see again, and that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>At once some kind of skin which had covered Sauls eyes came off. He was able to see again from then on. He got up and was baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And when he had eaten food, he was strong again. Saul stayed for some days with the disciples at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>Right away he went to the Jewish meeting places and told the people that Jesus is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All the people who heard him were surprised. They said, This man killed the people who called on Jesus name in Jerusalem. He came here to catch them and tie them and take them to the chief priests!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul became stronger and stronger. He proved that Jesus is the Christ and made it so plain that the Jews at Damascus did not know what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>Then some time after that, the leaders of the Jews planned to kill Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But he found out that they were waiting for him. The Jewish leaders watched the gates of the city night and day. They were waiting for a chance to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>Then one night the disciples put him in a basket and let him down outside the city wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When Saul came to Jerusalem, he wanted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them, Saul has seen the Lord on the road. The Lord has talked to him. After that he told Gods word in the name of Jesus, without fear at Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>So Saul stayed with the apostles and went around in Jerusalem. He told Gods word in the name of the Lord Jesus without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He talked to the Jews who spoke the Greek language. But they did not agree with Saul,  and so they made plans to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When the Christian brothers knew that, they took him to Caesarea. Then they sent him to Tarsus &lt;FI&gt;the city where he was born&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>After that, the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not troubled any more and they believed more strongly. The people obeyed the Lord, and the Holy Spirit helped them to believe. And many more people joined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>While Peter was travelling through all the towns, he came to visit Gods people who lived in the city of Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>There he saw a man named Aeneas who was sick. He could not stand up. He had been on his bed for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed! The man got up at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>All the people who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>In the city of Joppa there was a disciple. Her name was Tabitha. That means Dorcas or Gazelle. She did much good work and she gave many things to the poor people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>She became sick and died. They bathed her body and put her in a room upstairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Lydda was near Joppa. When the disciples heard that Peter was at Lydda, they sent two men and asked for him to come quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Peter got up and went with them. When he got there, they took him to the room upstairs.  Women whose husbands were dead stood there crying. They showed Peter the clothes and coats that Dorcas had made for them while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter put them all out. He kneeled down and talked to God. He turned to the body and said, Tabitha, get up. She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>He took her hand and helped her get up. Then he called in Gods people and the women,  and he gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>All over Joppa people heard about this. Many people believed on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>Peter stayed in Joppa for many days. He was with a man named Simon, who made skins into leather.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>In Caesarea lived a man named Cornelius. He was a big captain in the army. His soldiers were called the Italian Group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a good man. He and all the people of his house obeyed God. He gave many gifts to the poor. He always talked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About three oclock one afternoon, he clearly saw an angel from God coming to him in a vision. Cornelius, said the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>Cornelius looked at him. He was afraid and asked, What is it, Sir? The angel answered him, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Send men to Joppa to call Simon, whose other name is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea.  Peter will tell you what you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel which spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his house servants.  He also called one of the soldiers who believed in God and who always helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>He told them carefully all about his vision. Then he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>They went the next day. They were coming near to the city. About midday, Peter went up on the flat roof of the house to talk with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He became very hungry and wanted to eat. While food was being made ready, something like a dream came over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>He saw the sky open. A bundle like a big blanket was tied by the corners. It was let down to earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In the bundle were all kinds of animals and snakes and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>Then Peter heard a voice saying to him, Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>Then the voice spoke to him again, saying, What God has made clean you must not call unholy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened three times. Then the thing was taken up right away into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>I have seen a strange thing, Peter said to himself. I wonder what it all means. He was thinking about all this. And the men whom Cornelius sent had asked the way to Simons house. Now they stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>Is this where Simon Peter is staying? they called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>Peter was still thinking about what he had seen. Then the Spirit of God said to him,  Three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Get up. Go down and go with them. Do not fear to go, because I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter went down to the men whom Cornelius had sent to him. He said, Here I am.  You are looking for me. Why have you come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They answered, God sent a holy angel to Cornelius. He told him to call you to his house and hear what you have to say. Cornelius is a captain in the army. He is a good man. He does what is right and obeys God. All the Jews speak well of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Peter said, Come in. He had them stay as his guests. The next day he and some of the Christian brothers from Joppa went with the men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>The day after that, they reached Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them. He had called his family and close friends together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>Peter was about to enter the house. Cornelius met him. He kneeled down at his feet and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up and said, Please stand up. I too am only a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>Peter talked to him and went in with him. He saw many people who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He began to talk with them. He said, You yourselves know it is against our law for a Jew to visit and be friends with someone who is not a Jew. But God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>So when you sent for me, I did not say "No". Now I ask, why did you send for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius answered, Four days ago, it was just at this time, three oclock. I was in my house talking with God. I had not eaten any food. A man stood in front of me wearing shining clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>He said to me, "Cornelius, God has heard what you said to him. He has remembered your gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send men to Joppa to call for Simon Peter. He is staying with Simon, the man who makes skins into leather. His house is by the sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>So I sent for you right away. You have done well to come. Now we are all here before God to hear all that the Lord has told you to tell me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter began to speak, I really understand now. God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>But he takes anyone who obeys him. He takes anyone who does what is right. It does not matter to what nation they belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>To the people of Israel God has sent the good news. He gives peace through Jesus Christ.  He is Lord of all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>You yourselves know the story of what happened all through Judea. It started in Galilee after the baptism which John talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>God gave Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Spirit and power. Jesus went about doing good deeds. He healed all those who were held by the devil. God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>We saw all the things which he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And they hung him on a piece of wood and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>On the third day, God raised him up to let people see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>Not all the people saw him. But God had chosen us to see and to talk about him. We saw him. We ate and drank with him after he rose from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>He told us to tell the people that God chose him to judge both the living people and the dead people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>All the prophets tell about him. They say, "Everyone who believes in him will have his wrong ways forgiven through his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was saying this, the Holy Spirit came on all those who heard the message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>The believers who came with Peter were Jews. They were very much surprised that the Holy Spirit was also sent to those who were not Jews. 46,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>They heard them speak in tongues of other languages and praise God. Then Peter said,  These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have. Can anyone say they may not be baptised in water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>So he said they were to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. They begged him to stay with them for a while.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>The apostles and other Christian brothers were in Judea. They heard that some people who were not Jews had also believed Gods message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>When Peter went back to Jerusalem, the leaders of the Jews found fault with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>They asked, Why did you visit people who are not Jews? Why did you eat with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Peter explained to them all that had happened from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in the city of Joppa talking with God, he said. Something like a dream came over me. I saw a vision. I saw a bundle like a big blanket tied by the corners. It was let down from the sky. It came down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>When I looked at it, I wondered about it. I saw different kinds of tame animals, wild animals, snakes, and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter. Kill some and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, "No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is not holy or clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>Then the voice spoke from the sky a second time, saying, "What God has made clean,  you must not call unholy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This happened three times. Then everything was taken up into the sky again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>Right then three men came to the house where we were. They had come from Caesarea for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>The Spirit told me to go with them and not to fear. These six brothers went with me too.  We went into the mans house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>He told us that he had seen Gods angel standing in his house. The angel said to him,  "Send men to Joppa to call Simon whose other name is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>He will tell you and all your family how to be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he had come on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered that the Lord said, "John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>God gave then the same gift as he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. If God gave them this gift, how could I stop him? I am only a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When the people heard this, they were satisfied. They praised God saying, God has allowed the people who are not Jews to turn to him and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Some of the people had gone to other countries because of the big trouble when Stephen was killed. They went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told Gods word to the Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene. They went to Antioch. They also spoke to those who were not Jews, and they told them about the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The Lord was with them. Many believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>The people in the Jerusalem church heard this news. They sent Barnabas to go to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>When he reached there, he saw what had been done by the power of God. He was very glad. He talked to them. He begged them all to keep on following the Lord with all their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>Barnabas was a good man. He believed in God and was filled with the Holy Spirit. Many people came to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to get Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>When he found him, he took him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with all who believed in Jesus Christ. They taught many people. Antioch was the first place where the disciples were called Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>At that time, prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them named Agabus stood up. He told them the Spirit had shown him that much trouble would come to all the world. There would not be much food for the people. (This trouble came when Claudius Caesar was ruler.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples decided to help the Christian brothers who lived in Judea. They would each one send what he could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>They did so. They sent Barnabas and Saul to carry it to the church leaders &lt;FI&gt;in Jerusalem&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>At that time Herod the king caught some of the church people and troubled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>He killed James the brother of John with a long knife or sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>He saw that this pleased the leaders of the Jews, so he caught Peter also. This happened at the Jewish feast which they had each year to remember leaving Egypt. (It was called the Passover Feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>After Herod had caught Peter, he put him in prison. He told four groups of soldiers to guard him. There were four soldiers in each group. He planned to bring him out for trial before the people. But he would do it after the Passover Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in prison. And the church people asked God to help him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>The night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers. He was tied to them with two chains. Guards were at the door of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>An angel from the Lord came to him and a light shone in the prison. He hit Peters side and woke him up. Be quick, he said. Get up! His chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>Put on your belt and your shoes, said the angel. Peter did so. And now, said the angel,  put on your coat and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>Peter followed him out. He did not know that what the angel had done was true. He thought he was dreaming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>They passed the first and the second guard. Then they came to the iron gate out to the city. It opened for them by itself. So they went all the way down a street. Then the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel.  He has saved me from Herod and from all that the Jewish leaders are hoping will happen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And when he thought about this, he went to Marys house. Mary was John Marks mother. Many people were meeting there, talking to God &lt;FI&gt;about Peter&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>Peter knocked at the outside door. A young servant woman named Rhoda went to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>When she knew it was Peters voice, she was very glad. She did not open the door. But she ran in and told the people that Peter was at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said, You are crazy. But she kept on saying that Peter was really there. Then they said, It must be his angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Peter kept on knocking. When they opened the door and saw him, they were very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>He put out his hand for them to be quiet. Then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, Tell James and the brothers about this. Then he went away to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>In the morning the soldiers tried hard to find Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Herod had looked for him and had not found him. So he questioned the guards and ordered them to be taken away and killed. And then Peter went from Judea to Caesarea to live for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. But they got Blastus to speak to the king for them. Blastus was one of the men who worked in the kings house. They came to Herod together. They wanted to make peace with him because their country got its food from his country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>On a certain day Herod put on his kings robes and sat on his chair and made a speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people shouted, A god is talking to us. He is not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>At once an angel from God put a bad sickness on Herod because he did not give God the praise. Worms ate him and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>The word of God spread further and further and more people believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had finished their work. They brought John Mark with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who grew up with Herod the ruler, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>They were worshipping the Lord and fasting &lt;FI&gt;not eating food for a time&lt;Fi&gt; . The Holy Spirit said, Give me Barnabas and Saul to do the work for which I have called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>The men fasted and talked to God. Then they laid their hands on Barnabas and Paul and sent them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Barnabas and Saul left Antioch. The Holy Spirit sent them to the town of Seleucia. From there they went in a boat to the island of Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>When they reached the town of Salamis, they told Gods word in the meeting places of the Jews. John was with them to help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>They went through all the island to the town of Paphos. There they met a witch doctor.  He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus. He was not a true prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>This witch-doctor was with Sergius Paulus, the ruler of the country. Sergius Paulus was a wise man. He wanted to hear Gods word, so he called for Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>The witch-doctor was also called Elymas. He tried to stop them. He did not want the ruler to believe the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>Then Saul, who is also called Paul, being filled with the Holy Spirit, looked at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>You son of the devil! he said. You do nothing but tell lies and make much trouble. You hate everything that is right. The Lords way is right. Will you not stop spoiling his way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>See now, the Lords hand is upon you. You will be blind and will not be able to see the sun for a while. And right then something like a dark cloud came over Elymas eyes. He went around begging someone to take his hand and lead him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>The ruler saw what had happened. And he was very much surprised at the teaching about the Lord. He believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Paul and his friends left Paphos in a boat. They went to the town of Perga in the district of Pamphylia. There John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>The others went on from Perga. They came to Antioch in the district of Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the meeting house and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>First, someone read from the books of the law and the prophets. Then the rulers of the meeting house called Paul and Barnabas and said, Men and brothers, have you something to say that will help us? Please say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>Then Paul stood up and put out his hand. He said, Men of Israel and you who worship and fear God, please listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made the people into a large tribe when they were strangers in the land of Egypt. God brought them out of Egypt by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>For forty years in the wilderness God cared for them like a father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>God took seven tribes out of the land of Canaan. Then he divided the land among our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>God gave judges to rule over them until Samuel the prophet came. About four hundred and fifty years had passed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>Then the people asked for a king. God gave them Saul. He was the son of Kish, a man from Benjamins family. Saul was their king for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>Then God took him away. He made David king over them. This is what God said about him, "David, Jesses son, is the kind of man I love. He will do all that I want him to do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>God has given Israel a Saviour from Davids family, as he promised to do. His name is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>Before he came, John &lt;FI&gt;the baptiser&lt;Fi&gt; talked to all the people of Israel. He said they should stop doing wrong things and be baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>When John was finishing his work, he said, "Who do you think I am? I am not the one.  But wait, someone else will come after me. I am not good enough to untie his shoe strings."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Men and brothers, sons of Abraham, and all of you who worship God, the news of this way to be saved has been sent to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>The people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know who this Jesus really was.  They did not understand the words of the prophets of God long ago which were read every Sabbath day. But even so, they did what the prophets had said they would do.  They judged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>They could not prove that he did anything wrong for which he should die. Yet they begged Pilate to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>They did all the things that the prophets had written about him. Then they took him down from the cross made from a tree. They laid him in a grave cut from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>People had come with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. They saw him many days. Now they tell people what they saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we are bringing you this good news. God made a promise to our fathers long ago.  Now he has made his promise come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>We, their children, have now received the promise. He sent Jesus just as it was written in the second psalm, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>God raised Jesus from death. His body did not go back to the grave to be spoiled. Here is what God said about it. "I will give to you the blessings which I promised David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>In another psalm it says, "You will not let the body of your Holy One be spoiled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>As for David, he did the work God wanted him to do for the people in his time. Then,  after that, he died. He was buried with his fathers. His body spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But God has raised one from death. His body did not spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Men and brothers, understand this. It is because of this Jesus that we tell you your wrong ways will be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>The law of Moses could not make you free. But this man makes you free. You will not be judged if you believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Be careful then, so that what the prophets said will not happen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>They said, "Look, you people who despise everything. You will look in wonder before you die. I will do something in your time. I will do something that you will not believe even if someone told you what it is."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>As Paul and Barnabas left the meeting house the people said, Tell us these things again next Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>The meeting was finished. There were many Jews, also those who were not Jews but worshipped God. They followed Paul and Barnabas. Paul and Barnabus kept talking to the people and told them to keep on living in the way that will bring Gods blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>The next Sabbath day almost all of the people in that city gathered to hear Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>The leaders of the Jews saw that many people came. They were very jealous. They talked back to Paul and said he was not telling the truth. They also said wrong things about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But Paul and Barnabas did not fear the Jewish leaders. They said, We had to tell Gods word to you first but you will not listen to it. By that you are saying you Jews are not good enough to live for ever. So we will go to the people who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>That is what the Lord told us to do. He said, "I have made you to be a light to the people who are not Jews. You will tell people everywhere in the world how to be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>Those who were not Jews heard this. They were glad and they thanked God for his message. All those who had been chosen to live for ever believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>The word of the Lord was told through all that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the leaders of the Jews talked to the leading women who worshipped God and to the chief men of Antioch. They made plenty of trouble for Paul and Barnabas. They made them leave that part of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and left them. They went on to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>In Iconium Paul and Barnabas did as they had done before in other places. They went into the Jews meeting place and spoke. Many of the Jews and the other people believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the Jews who did not believe said wrong things about them. They spoiled the minds of those who were not Jews so that they hated the Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time anyway. They did not fear to talk about the Lord. The Lord proved that the message about his blessing was true. He worked through Paul and Barnabas. They did signs and wonderful things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>The people of the city were divided. Some of them agreed with the Jewish leaders. Some of them agreed with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>Then some of those people who were not Jews joined together with the Jews and their leaders. They made a plan to give the apostles much trouble and to kill them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>Paul and Barnabas found out about this. So they left quickly. They went to Lystra and Derbe in the district of Lycaonia and the country around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>There they told people the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>At Lystra a man was sitting. He was not able to walk because he had no strength in his feet. He had never walked since he was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This man heard Paul speak. Paul looked at the man. He saw that the man believed he would be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>Paul said, Stand up on your feet! The man jumped up and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>When the people saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their own language, The gods have become like men! They have come down to visit us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They named Barnabas, Jupiter. And they named Paul, Mercury, because he was the one who talked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>There was a temple of Jupiter in front of the city. The priest of the temple brought animals and flowers to the gates to make a sacrifice. All the people were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes and ran in among the people shouting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>They said, Why are you people doing this? We are only men like you. You should leave these gods which cannot help you. You should turn to the living God. He made the sky,  the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In the time that is past, God allowed all people to do what they wanted to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>But even then he had some ways to make himself known. He did things that were good.  He gave us rain from the sky and good harvests. And he gives you all the food you need and makes you very happy. Surely these things speak for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>By saying these things they stopped the people from making sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>Some of the Jewish leaders from Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra and won the people to their side. They threw stones at Paul. Then they carried him out of the city because they thought he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But as the disciples gathered around him, he got up and they went back into the city. The next day Paul and Barnabas left and went to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>They told the good news to the people in Derbe. Many people believed what they taught.  Then they went back to Lystra, to Iconium. and to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>They talked to the disciples to help them. They told them to keep on believing. They said,  We must go through much trouble to get into Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>They chose leaders for them in every church. They talked with God and fasted. When they were finished, they gave the leaders over to the Lords care, because they believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>They went through the district of Pisidia to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>They told the good news to the people in Perga. Then they went to the town of Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they went in a boat to Antioch. It was there that the people had given them over to Gods care. They had asked him to bless them in this work. Now they had finished the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>When they reached the city, they called all the church people together. They told them all that God had done for them. They said, Now God has opened the way to believe for those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>Paul and Barnabas stayed a long time with the disciples at Antioch.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>Some men came from Judea and taught the Christian brothers. They said, You must be circumcised with the mark made on your body in the way Moses taught us. If you are not circumcised you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Paul and Barnabas did not agree with them. There was much talking about it. Then they decided that Paul and Barnabas and some of the other men should go to Jerusalem. They would ask the apostles and church leaders there about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So the church people sent them on their way. They passed through the districts of Phoenicia and Samaria. They told them that some who were not Jews were believing in God. This news made all the Christian brothers very happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church people, the apostles,  and the church leaders. They told all that God had done as he worked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group stood up and said, They must be circumcised &lt;FI&gt;like the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; . We must tell them to keep all the laws of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>The apostles and the church leaders met together to talk the matter over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>After much talking about it, Peter stood up. He said, Men and brothers, you know what happened in the first days. God chose me to tell the good news to those who are not Jews. They believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>God knows what is in a persons heart. He proved that they believed. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>God made no difference between them and us. He made their hearts clean when they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>So now why are you doing what God did not do? You give the disciples a hard thing to do. Our fathers could not do it. And we cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>We believe that the Lord Jesus saves us because he is kind. And that is why he saves them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then all the people stopped talking. They listened to what Paul and Barnabas had to say.  They told them about all the signs and wonderful things that God had helped them to do among the people who were not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>When they had finished talking, James said, Men and brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has told us how God came the first time to the people who are not Jews. God chose some of them to belong to him and be his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>This is what the prophets of God said long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>They said, "After this, I will come back and build up again the house of David which has fallen down. I will take the broken pieces and build a house again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>Then all the other people will find God, even those who are not Jews but who belong to me. So says the Lord, who is doing all these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>He told us these things long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>So now, this is what I think. We should not trouble those who are not Jews but who have turned to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>We should write them a letter and tell them what they must not do. They must not eat food that has been given to idols. They must not have sex with someone who is not their husband or wife. They must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. They must not taste blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>Since the times of long ago there have been men who told about Moses in every city.  They read his laws in the meeting places every Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then the apostles, and the leaders, and all the church people chose men from among themselves. They sent them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas,  whose other name was Barsabbas, and Silas. They were leaders among the Christian brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They sent a letter with them. It said, The apostles, the church leaders, and the Christian brothers send greetings to the Christians who are not Jews in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>We have heard that some of our people visited you and talked to you. They taught things that troubled you and made you believe wrong things. They said, "You must be circumcised like the Jews and keep the law." We did not tell them to teach you this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>All of us gathered here have chosen some men. We are sending them with our dear brothers, Barnabas and Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>Barnabas and Paul have been willing to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We are sending Judas and Silas. They will tell you the same things that we have written in the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>The Holy Spirit and we thought it was not good to give you a hard thing to do. But here is what you must not do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>You must not eat food that has been given to idols. You must not eat the meat of animals that are killed by choking. You must not taste blood. You must not commit adultery. If you keep away from these things, you will do well. Goodbye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So the men left and went to Antioch. There they called the people together and gave them the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>When the people read the letter, they were very glad. It helped them to become stronger in what they believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Judas and Silas were prophets. They said many things to the Christian brothers and helped them to believe more strongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>They stayed there for a while. Then the brothers sent them back to those who had sent them. They sent a greeting of peace with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>But Silas thought it was good to stay at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Paul and Barnabas stayed there too. They taught the people and told them the Lords message. Many other men did this also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>Some days later, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back and visit the brothers in every city where we have told the Lords message. Let us see how they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul did not think that they should take him. John Mark had left them when they were at Pamphylia. He had not gone along with them to do the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>The feeling about this matter was very strong between Barnabas and Paul, so they did not go together. Barnabas took Mark and went in a boat to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>Paul chose Silas. The Christian brothers asked the Lord to bless Paul. Then he went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>Paul travelled through Syria and Cilicia. He helped the church people to believe more strongly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there. His mother was a Jew, a believer, and his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>The Christian brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke very well of Timothy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted him to go with him. He circumcised him because all the Jews in those places knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>They went from town to town and talked to the people. They told them what the apostles and church leaders at Jerusalem had said should be done. So the church people became stronger in what they believed. Every day more people joined the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Paul and Silas went through the district of Phrygia and Galatia. The Holy Spirit said they should not tell Gods word in the country of Asia Minor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>After they came to the district of Mysia, they wanted to go to the country of Bithynia but the Holy Spirit did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So they went by Mysia and came to the city of Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>In the night Paul had a vision: he saw a picture like a dream. He saw a man of Macedonia standing and calling to him, Come over into Macedonia and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>After Paul had seen the vision, we tried to leave for Macedonia right away. We believed that the Lord had called us to tell the people there the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>So we left Troas in a boat and went straight across the water to the town of Samothrace.  The next day we went to Neapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>From there we went to Philippi. This was the big city of the district of Macedonia. It was a free city. We stayed there for some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the river. We thought this was a place where people met to talk with God. So we sat down and talked to the women who had come there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>One woman named Lydia listened to us. She was from the city of Thyatira, and she sold red cloth. She worshipped God. He worked in her heart and she believed what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>She and all the people in her house were baptised. Then she begged us and said, If you really feel that I believe in the Lord, come and stay at my house. And she would not allow us to say no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>One day we were going to the meeting place where people talked with God. We met a girl who had a bad spirit. She used to tell people what was going to happen. Her masters received much money when she did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>This girl kept on following Paul and us. She was shouting, These men are servants of the High God. They are telling us how to be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>She did this for many days. This troubled Paul. He turned and said to the spirit in her, In the name of Jesus Christ, I say to you, come out of her! And the spirit came out at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>Her masters saw that they had lost this way of getting money. They caught Paul and Silas and took them by force to the rulers in the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>When they had brought them before the judges, they said, These men are Jews. And they are making much trouble in our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>They are teaching people laws which we may not obey because we are Roman people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>All the people standing around were against Paul and Silas. The judges tore off the clothes of Paul and Silas. They gave orders that they should be beaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>They beat them very hard. Then they put them in prison. Take care, they said to the prison guard. Be sure that these prisoners do not run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>And so the guard put them in the back room in the prison. They locked their feet in holes cut in heavy pieces of wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>At midnight, Paul and Silas were talking with God. They were singing and praising God.  The other prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>Then all of a sudden the earth shook very much. Even the floor of the prison was shaking. All the doors came wide open. The things that held the prisoners all came off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>The prison guard woke up. He saw all the prison doors open. So he took a long knife and was going to kill himself. He thought that all the prisoners had run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>Paul shouted, Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>The guard called for a light and went in quickly. He kneeled down before Paul and Silas,  trembling with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>He brought them out of the prison and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>They replied, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. All the people in your house must do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>They talked to him and all the people in the house. They told them the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>Paul and Silas had sores from the beating in prison. So that same hour of the night the guard washed them. Then he and all the people of his house were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>He took Paul and Silas to his home and gave them food to eat. He and all the people in his house were very happy. They now believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>In the morning the judges sent soldiers to the guard with a message. Let those men go free, they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The guard told Paul. He said, The judges have sent a message that you may go free. So now, come out and go on your way. You will have no more trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said, We are Romans. And they have beaten us outside where people can see.  They have put us in prison without proving we have done wrong. Now, are they going to take us out of prison secretly? No, they themselves must come and take us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The soldiers told this to the judges. They were very much afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>So they came to Paul and Silas. They said they were sorry for what they had done. They brought them out of prison and asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>When Paul and Silas came out of prison, they went back to Lydias house. They saw their Christian brothers and talked to them. This helped the Christians to believe more strongly.  Then Paul and Silas went on their way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Paul and Silas went through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia. Then they reached the town of Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>As he had done in other places, Paul went into it. On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>He proved these things from the writings. He said. It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city. They shouted, These men have turned the world upside down. Now they have come here also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>Jason has taken them into his house. None of them obeys the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king named Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money. Then they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea. When they reached there, they went into the Jews meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica. They were glad to listen to Pauls words. Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Through this, many of them believed. Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea. They came to Berea and talked to the people. They said things that made the people very angry against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away. But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>The men took Paul to the city of Athens. Paul told them to tell Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy at Athens. He saw that the city was full of idols.  His spirit was troubled about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God. In the market every day, he talked to people he met there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, What does this talker have to say? Others said, He seems to be talking about new gods. This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said,  We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way.  They liked to tell and to hear some new thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul stood up in the court and said, You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious and worship many gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>As I walked about, I looked at the things you worship. I saw one place where you make sacrifices. You have written on it, "To the God we do not know." You are worshipping that God, but you do not know him. I will tell you about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>He made the world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the sky and the earth. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything. He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>God made one man. From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth. He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>He did this so they would look for him. He wanted them to reach out and find him. But he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>In him we live, and move, and are alive. Some of your own writers have said, "We have come from him".</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Therefore we have all come from God. So we should not think that God is something made of gold, or silver, or stone. He is not made by mens hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>In times past God did not look at what people did. They did not know any better then.  But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way. He has chosen a man to do this. He has proved to all people who the man is. He has raised him from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death, some of them laughed. Others said, We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So then Paul left them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But some men followed him and believed. Among those who believed was Dionysius. He was a judge in the Areopagus court. And a woman named Damaris believed. There were others also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After this Paul left Athens and went to the city of Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>There he met a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus. A short time before this he and his wife Priscilla had come from the country of Italy. They left Italy because Claudius the ruler had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. This was the big city in Italy. Paul went to the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>Pauls work had been the making of tents, and that is what they did. So he stayed with them. They worked together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>Every Sabbath day he talked with the people in the meeting place for the Jews. He tried to talk so that the Jews and the Greeks would believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul felt in his heart that he must prove to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But the people talked back to Paul. And they said wrong things about him. Paul shook his clothes and said to them, If you are lost, it is your own fault, not mine! From now on I will go to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he left. He went to the house of a man named Justus who worshipped God. His house was next to the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus was the head ruler of the meeting house. He and his whole family believed in the Lord. Many of the people in Corinth heard and believed. And they were baptised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>The Lord said to Paul in a vision in the night, Do not fear. Keep on speaking. Do not stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>I am with you. nobody will hurt you. I have many people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So Paul stayed there for one year and six months. He taught the people Gods word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>When Gallio was the ruler of the province of Achaia, the Jews got together to stop Paul.  They took him to court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>They said, This man is talking to the people. He is trying to make them worship God in a way that is against our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Paul wanted to speak. Then Gallio said to the Jews, You Jews, if it were a matter of wrong or of doing something very bad, I would listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But this is a matter about words and names and about your own law. So you must go and take care of it yourselves! I will not judge such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them out of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>They caught a man. His name was Sosthenes. He was the head ruler of the meeting house. They beat him in front of the judge, but Gallio did nothing about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul stayed there for many days. Then he said goodbye to the Christian brothers and went in a boat to the country of Syria. Priscilla and Aquila went with him. In the town of Cenchrea he cut his hair off. This was because he had made a promise to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>When they reached the city of Ephesus, Paul left the others there. He himself went to the meeting place and talked with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>The Jews begged him to stay longer but he would not stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>Goodbye, he said. I will come back to you again if it is Gods will. Then he got in a boat and left Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>When he reached Caesarea, he went to greet the church people. Then he went on to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>He stayed there for a while. Then he left and went through all the countries of Galatia and Phrygia. He helped the disciples to believe more strongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>A Jew came to Ephesus. His name was Apollos. He was born in Alexandria. He spoke with power and was able to explain the holy writings well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been taught the way of the Lord. He was strong in spirit as he talked to people. What he taught them about the Lord was true. But he knew only about the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak without fear in the meeting place. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him to their house. They explained the way of God so that he knew more about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>Apollos decided to go into Achaia. The Christian brothers wrote to the disciples there and asked them to receive him. When he reached Achaia, he helped very much those who believed. They believed because God was kind to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>He talked strongly with the Jews before the people. He proved to them from the holy writings that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul went over land and came to the city of Ephesus.  There he met some disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>Paul asked them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? They said, No.  We have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>Paul asked them, How were you baptised? They said, We were baptised in Johns way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Then Paul said, John baptised people when they stopped their wrong ways. He told people that they should believe on the one who would follow him. That one is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>Paul put his hands on them. Then the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues of other lang-uages and spoke words from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>In all, there were about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>Paul went into the meeting place. For three months he talked without fear to the people there. He tried to talk so that people would obey God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>Some of them were fixed in their minds and would not believe. They said, The Christian way is not good They said this in front of all the people. So Paul left them and took the disciples away. He talked and answered the questions of the people every day in the school of a man named Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, and all the people who lived in the province of Asia, both the Jews and the Greeks, heard the Lords word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God did big works through Paul. Even some pieces of cloth he had touched were carried to sick people and they were healed. Also, people who had bad spirits in them were made free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>missing fehlt/missing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Some Jews were there who travelled about from place to place. They had power over bad spirits like witch-doctors. They tried to make people free from bad spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. They said to the spirits, I tell you, in the name of Jesus, the one Paul talks about, come out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There was a Jew named Sceva. He was a chief priest. He had seven sons who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the bad spirit answered, I know Jesus and I know Paul. But who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man who had the bad spirit in him jumped on them. He beat them all because he was stronger than they were. Their bodies were bleeding and their clothes were torn.  They ran out of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>When all the Jews and the Greeks at Ephesus knew about this, they all feared. And they had great respect for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many of the people who believed, told God all the bad things they used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many had been witch-doctors. They brought their books and burned them in front of all the people. All the books together had cost about 50,000 silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Gods word spread with power. It reached more and more people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After this, Paul decided he would go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to Jerusalem. After I have been there, he said, l must go to see the city of Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>He sent Timothy and Erastus, two of his helpers, into Macedonia. But he himself stayed in Asia Minor for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>About that time there was much trouble because of the Christian way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>A man named Demetrius made things from silver. He made little silver houses like the big house of the idol-god Diana. He and other men got much money from this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>Demetrius called them all together. He said, Men, you know that we get our money from this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>Now you see and hear how this man Paul has talked. He has turned away many people in Ephesus. Not only that, but he has turned away the hearts of many people in almost all of Asia Minor. He says that things made by mens hands are not really gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>This will spoil our work. Not only that, but people will not respect the house of the great idol goddess Diana any more. All the people in Asia and in the whole world worship her now. But they will despise her!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>When they heard this, the men were very angry and shouted, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>All the people in the city were excited. They caught two men from Macedonia. Their names were Gaius and Aristarchus. They had travelled with Paul. Then they all rushed to the big meeting place with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people, but the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>Some of the leaders in Asia Minor liked Paul. They sent word to him and begged him not to go into the meeting place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some of the people were shouting one thing and some another. They were all stirred up.  Most of the people did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>The Jews pushed Alexander forward. Some of the people put him in front. He put up his hand and wanted to talk to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they saw that he was a Jew, they all shouted together for two hours, Great is Diana of Ephesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>At last the city chief stopped the shouting. He said, Men of Ephesus, everyone knows that all the people of Ephesus take care of the house of the great Diana. And they take care of the stone which fell from the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>No person can say it is not true. So you should be quiet and not do anything foolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>The men whom you have brought here have not taken anything from the house. They have not even said anything wrong about our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Now then, if Demetrius and the men who work with him have any complaint, let them take it to law. We have a court and we have judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>If you want anything more than that, it must be done in a meeting which has been called by law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>We may have trouble because of what has happened today. There is not one good reason for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>When he had said this, he closed the meeting.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>When everything was quiet, Paul called the disciples. He talked to them so they would not be afraid. Then he said goodbye and left. He went to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>He went through that country and talked to the people. He helped them to believe more strongly. Then he went to Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>He stayed there for three months. When he was ready to go to Syria by boat, he heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him. So he said, I will go back through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>Some men went with him as far as Asia Minor. They were Sopater from Berea,  Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, and also Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia Minor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>After the days of the Passover Feast, we left Philippi by boat. Five days later we met them in Troas. We stayed there for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week the disciples met together to break bread. Paul was ready to leave the next day. He talked a long time to the people at the meeting until long into the night. They were gathered in an upstairs room with many lights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>A young man named Eutychus sat in the window. He became very sleepy. When Paul kept talking so long, Eutychus was very deep in sleep and fell down from the third floor.  When the people picked him up he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Paul went down stairs. He lay on him and put his arms around him. Do not fear, he said. He is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then Paul went upstairs again. He broke bread and ate some food. He talked for a long time, until daybreak. After that, he left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>The people took the young man. They were very glad because he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>We went by boat to the town of Assos. We were going to meet Paul there and take him on the boat. He told us to do that because he wanted to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>We met him at Assos, took him on the boat, and went to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>Then we went by boat the next day and came to Chios. The next day we passed the town of Samos. We reached Miletus on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>Paul decided not to stop at Ephesus. He did not want to spend time in Asia Minor. He kept going as fast as he could, because he hoped to be at the feast in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>He sent a message from Miletus to Ephesus to call the leaders of the church to come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>When they came, he said, You know how I have lived all the time that I have been with you. I lived that way from the first day I came into Asia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>But in every city the Holy Spirit tells me I will be put in prison. I will have much trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But none of these things trouble me. I do not try to save my life. All I want is to finish what I must do with joy. The work which the Lord Jesus gave me is to tell the good news that God is kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>I know that you all will never see me again. I have told you about Gods kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>So I tell you today that if any one is lost, it is not my fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>I have not feared to tell you all that God wants you to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>The Holy Spirit has made you leaders over his people. Watch yourselves. Like one who takes care of his sheep, so you must take care of the church people. They are the Lords people. He gave his blood for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I know this, that there are people as bad as wild animals. After I leave you, they will come to you. They will trouble Gods people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>Also, some men will come from among you. They will teach things that are not true.  They want people to follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>So then, watch and remember this. For three years, through the night and in the day, I told every one of you to be careful. I even cried as I told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now, my brothers, I give you to God. I leave with you his word which brings blessing. That word is able to make you strong. It will give you your share in the good things of God promised by him. He gives these good things to people who are pure and holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I did not want anyone to give me money or clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to pay for the things that I and my friends needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have always shown you that you must work hard, as I have. You must help those who cannot work. By so doing you are remembering the words of the Lord Jesus. He said, "It makes you more happy to give something than to get something."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>When Paul had said this, he kneeled down and talked to God with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>They all cried much. They put their arms around his neck and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>They were sad most of all because he had said they would not see him again. And they went with him to the boat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>When we had said goodbye to them, we left them. We went straight across the water to the island of Cos. The next day we came to the island of Rhodes. Then we went to the city of Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>There we found a boat going to the country of Phoenicia, so we went there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>When we saw the island of Cyprus, we went on the right side of it to Syria. We landed at Tyre because they unloaded the boat there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>We found some Christians and stayed for seven days. The Holy Spirit spoke through them to Paul, Do not go on to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>When the seven days had passed, we left and went on our way. All of the men, women,  and children went with us out of the city. There by the sea we kneeled down and talked to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>We said goodbye to each other. Then we got on the boat and they went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>From Tyre we went to Ptolemais. There we greeted the Christian brothers and stayed with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went into the house of Philip. He was a man who went out telling the good news. He was one of the seven helpers in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>He had four daughters who spoke words from God. They were not married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>While we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>When he came to us, he took Pauls belt. He tied his own hands and feet with it. Then he said, The Holy Spirit has told me that in the same way the leaders of the Jews in Jerusalem will tie the man who owns this belt. They will give him over to the people who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>When we heard this, both we and the people there talked to Paul and begged him not to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul answered, Why are you crying and making me sad like this? I am ready to be tied and also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>So when we saw that he would not change his mind, we stopped begging him. We said,  May the Lord do what he wants to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>After that, we took our things and went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Some of the Christians from Caesarea went with us. One of them was Mnason, a man born in Cyprus. He was one of the first Christian believers. We stayed in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>When we reached Jerusalem, the Christian brothers were glad to see us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>The next day Paul went with us to see James. All the church leaders were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>First, Paul greeted them. Then he told them one by one the things God had done as he worked among the people who were not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>When they heard it, they praised the Lord. They said to Paul, Brother, there are many thousands of Jews who believe. They all say we must obey the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>They have heard that you teach all the Jews who live in other lands. They heard that you tell them not to obey Moses law: that they need not circumcise their children like the Jews do; and they can leave the Jewish ways of living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What should we do about it? Many people will gather together because they will surely hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Now then, do the thing we tell you. We have four men who have made a promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them with you. Make yourself clean with them, the way the law says to do. Pay the cost for having their hair cut. Then all the people will know that all the things they heard about you are not true. They will know that you live the way the law says you should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>We sent a letter to those who are not Jews and have believed. Here is what we told them they must not do. They must not touch things that have been given to idols. They must not taste blood. They must not eat the meat of animals that were killed by choking. And they must not take part in any kind of wrong sexual behaviour between men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men with him. The next day he made himself clean with them the way the law says to do. Then he went into the temple. He told the priests which day they would finish making themselves clean. On that day a sacrifice would be made for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>The seven days were almost over. The Jewish leaders from Asia Minor saw Paul in the temple. They got all the people there excited. They caught hold of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>They shouted, All you men of Israel, come and help us! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere not to respect our people. He says we need not obey the law or respect this temple. And what is more, he has brought Greek people into the temple. He has made this holy place unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>They said this because they had seen a man from Ephesus named Trophimus. He was in the city with Paul. And they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>So all the people in the city were excited. They came running. They caught Paul and took him out of the temple by force. Then the doors were shut behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>They were trying to kill him. The officer in charge of the soldiers heard that all the people of Jerusalem were making trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>Right away he took some soldiers and officers with him and ran down to the people.  When the people saw them they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the officer came up and took Paul. He had him tied with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some of the crowd shouted one thing and some of them shouted something else. The captain could not find out what was true. The people were shouting too much. So he told his soldiers to take Paul into their army house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When Paul came to the steps, the soldiers carried him because the people were fighting to get him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>They were all following, shouting, Kill him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>Just as the soldiers were going to take Paul into their army house, he said to the officer,  May I tell you something? So, you speak the Greek language! said the officer. I thought you were the man from the country of Egypt who made trouble a while ago. I thought you were the one who led four thousand bad men into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. I belong to a great city.  Please let me talk to these people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>So the officer let him talk. Paul stood on the steps and put up his hand. Then all the people were very quiet. He talked to them in the Jews language.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Paul said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen while I tell you my side of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>When the people heard him speak in the Jews language, they were even more quiet.  Then Paul said, I am a Jew. I was born in the city of Tarsus in Cilicia. But I was raised here in this city. Gamaliel was my teacher. He taught me very well in the law of our fathers. I was trying hard to obey God, just as you all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I troubled very much the people who believed this Way. I even killed them. I had men and women tied and put into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>The high priest and all the leaders know that this is true about me. They wrote letters for me to carry to the leaders of the Jews in the city of Damascus. I went to have the Christians there tied and brought to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>I was on my way and was near Damascus. It was about midday. All at once a very bright light from the sky shone all around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground and heard someone say to me, "Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>I said, "Who are you, Lord?" He answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth. You are troubling me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>The men who were with me saw the light. They were afraid. But they did not hear the one who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>Then I said, "Lord, what shall I do?" And the Lord said to me, "Get up and go to Damascus. There someone will tell you all you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>I could not see because the light was so bright. My friends led me by the hand to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>A man named Ananias was there. He obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there spoke well of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>He came to see me. He stood by my side and said to me, "Brother Saul, you can see again!" And right then I was able to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>He said, "The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will. He chose you to see the One who is right and to hear him speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>You will speak for him. You will tell all the people what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>Now, why do you wait? Get up and be baptised. Wash away your wrong ways by calling on the name of the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>After I went back to Jerusalem, I was talking to God in the temple one day. Something like a dream came over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>I heard the Lord say to me, "Leave Jerusalem quickly, right away. The people will not listen to the things you say about me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, "Lord, they know that I put in prison those who believed in you. I beat them in all the meeting houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And I stood by and let people kill Stephen. He was one who talked for you. I looked after the clothes of the men who killed him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>But the Lord said to me, "Go! I will send you far away to the people who are not Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>The people listened to Paul until he said that. Then they shouted, Kill him and get him off the earth. A man like that should not live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>The people shouted. They waved their clothes about and threw dust in the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>The man in charge of the soldiers ordered Paul to be brought into the army house. He said that he should be beaten hard to make him tell why the people shouted so much at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>When they had tied him with ropes, Paul said to the captain who was standing by, Is it right for you to beat a man who belongs to Rome without judging his case?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the captain heard this, he told the commanding officer. He said, What are you going to do? This man is a Roman!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the commanding officer came to Paul and said, Tell me, are you a Roman? Yes, I am, replied Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>Then the officer said, I paid much money to become a Roman. Paul said, I was born a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then the men who were going to beat him left him. The officer was afraid when he knew Paul was a Roman, because he had tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The officer wanted to know the real reason why the Jewish leaders were angry with Paul. So the next day he had Paul untied. He called the chief priests and the leaders to hold a court meeting. Then he took Paul down and brought him in before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Paul looked at the members of the court and said, My brothers, I have done what I thought God wanted me to do, right up to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>Ananias, the high priest, said to those who were standing near Paul, Hit his mouth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Paul said, God will hit you down, you dirty wall painted white! You sit there to judge me by the law and you break the law by telling them to hit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>The people who stood near Paul said, Do you say a wrong thing like that to Gods high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paul said, I did not know that he is a high priest. The holy writings say, "You shall not say anything wrong about a ruler of your people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Paul knew that some of the men were from the Sadducee group and some of them were from the Pharisee group. So he called out in the court, My brothers, I am a Pharisee. My fathers were Pharisees. I am being judged because I believe that the dead will be raised to life again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>When he had said that, the Pharisees and the Sadducees began to talk back and forth.  The men in the court were divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>The Sadducees say the dead will not be raised again. They say there is no angel or spirit.  But the Pharisees believe in all these three things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>There was much shouting. Some of the clever men who were Pharisees got up. They said, We do not think this man has done wrong. Perhaps some angel or spirit really did speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>The people started fighting. The commanding officer was afraid they would tear Paul into pieces. So he told the soldiers to take Paul and bring him into the army house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>The next night the Lord stood beside Paul. He said, Be glad, Paul. You have told people about me in Jerusalem. You must also talk about me in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>In the morning, some of the Jewish leaders planned together. They made a promise that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty Jews who made this secret plan together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They came to the chief priests and leaders and said, We have made a promise for ourselves. We will not eat anything until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>So now, you and the members of the court send word to the commanding officer. Tell him to bring Paul down to you. Make him think you want to find out more about Paul.  We will be ready to kill him before he gets there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>The son of Pauls sister heard about their secret plan. So he went into the army house and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Paul called one of the officers and said to him, Take this young man to the commanding officer. He has something to tell him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So the officer took him to the commanding officer. He said, Paul, the prisoner, called me. He asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The officer took the young man by the arm. He went to one side so they could be alone.  He asked, What do you want to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>The young man said, The leaders of the Jews have made a plan. They will ask you to bring Paul down to court tomorrow. They will say that they wish to find out more about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But you must not do this. More than forty Jews are waiting for him. They have made a promise to themselves. They will not eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now and waiting for your agreement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the commanding officer sent the young man away. He said, You must not tell anyone that you have told me about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>The commanding officer called two officers to him. He said, Get two hundred soldiers ready by nine oclock tonight to go to Caesarea. Send seventy men with them who will ride on horses and two hundred men who will carry spears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>Also have horses ready for Paul to ride. Take him safely to Felix, the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>The officer wrote a letter to Felix like this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias sends greetings to you, great ruler Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was caught by the Jews. They were ready to kill him. But I came with my soldiers and took him away, because I found out that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>I wanted to find out what complaint they had against him, so I brought him into their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found out that their complaints were to do with their law. But he had not done anything wrong enough to die or to be put into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>When I heard that the Jewish leaders were planning to catch him, I sent him to you at once. I told those who are making complaints against him that they must bring the matter to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers took Paul as they had been told to do. They went with him that night as far as the town of Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>The next day the soldiers went back to the barracks. Only the men who were riding horses went with Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>When they reached Caesarea, they gave the letter to the ruler and brought Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>He read the letter. Then he asked Paul what country he came from. He heard that Paul was from Cilicia. Then he said, I will hear all you have to say when the men who have made the complaint come here. He ordered Paul to be kept in the house which is called Herods palace.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Five days later, Ananias the high priest came from Jerusalem. He brought with him some of the leaders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They told the ruler their complaint against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>Paul was called in. Tertullus began to bring the complaints. Great ruler Felix, he said,  we have peace because of what you have done. These people have a better life because of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>We are always very glad for this everywhere we go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>I do not want to take much of your time. But please be kind and listen to a few words from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>We have found this man to be a real trouble-maker. He talks to the Jews all over the world and causes them to disobey the laws. He is the leading trouble-maker of the Nazarene group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>He even tried to make the temple unclean. But we caught him and were going to judge him by our law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>But Lysias the commanding officer came. He took Paul away from us by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>He told those who have complaints against him to come to you. Ask him yourself and you will find out from him about all these complaints we have brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews agreed with what Tertullus the lawyer said. They said, Yes, yes, he is telling the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>The ruler made a sign for Paul to speak. So Paul said, I know that for many years you have judged matters for this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>So I am happy to speak for myself. Not more than twelve days ago I went to Jerusalem to worship. If you ask the people, you will find this out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>They did not find me quarrelling with anyone in the temple. I was not making trouble among the people in the meeting houses or in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>They cannot prove the things they have said against me here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But I myself tell you this. I worship the God of my fathers in the Christian way. They say this is not the right way. I believe everything that the law teaches. I believe everything that the prophets have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>I believe that God will raise from death both the good people and the bad people. These people here believe the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>I always try to do what is right to God and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>I was away for a few years and I had come to Jerusalem to bring gifts to my people, and to give offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>While I was doing this, they found me in the temple. I had made myself clean the way the law says to do. I did not have many people around me. I was not making trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>Some Jews were there from Asia Minor. They should be here before you and talk against me if they have anything to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these men here tell if they found anything wrong with me when I stood in their court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>I did this one thing. I shouted while I was standing among them, "I am being judged today because I believe that the dead will be raised again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>Felix sent them away because he knew many things about the Christian way. He said,  When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will know everything about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He said to the officer, Keep Paul in prison but let him have some freedom. Let his friends come to visit him and to do things for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Some days after that, Felix came with his wife Drusilla. She was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to what Paul said about believing in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>Paul talked about what is right, about living the right way, and about the time when all people will be judged. Felix was very much afraid when he heard these things. He said to Paul, You may go now. When I have time, I will call you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He hoped that Paul would give him money to free him. And so he often sent for Paul and talked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>After two years, a man named Porcius Festus came to rule in Felixs place. Felix had wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Three days after Festus came to the country, he went to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>Then the chief priests and the leaders of the Jews told him what they had against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>Please do something for us, they begged. Send for Paul to come to Jerusalem. They had made a secret plan to kill him on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus said, Paul is being kept in prison in Caesarea. I myself am going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Let the men among you who are able come with me. If Paul has done anything wrong,  then they can talk against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>Festus stayed only eight or ten days more among them. Then he went to Caesarea. The next day he sat on his chair in the court and had Paul brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When Paul came in, the Jewish leaders who had come from Jerusalem stood around Paul. They talked much against him. But they could not prove that the things they said were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul spoke for himself. He said, I have done no wrong to the law, or to the temple, or against Caesar the ruler of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Festus wanted to please the Jewish leaders, so he said to Paul, Will you go to Jerusalem and let me judge you there about these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Paul said, I am standing in Caesars court. That is where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews. You yourself know that well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If I have done wrong things, or any wrong thing for which I should die, then I do not ask to live. But if the things these people say are not true, then no one has power to give me up to the leaders of the Jews. I ask to go to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>So Festus talked the matter over with the court. Then he said to Paul, You have asked to go to Caesar. All right, you will go to Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>Some time after that, king Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>They stayed for many days. Festus brought Pauls matter to the king. He said, Felix left a man in prison here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priest and leaders of the Jews came to me. They talked against him, and they asked me to punish him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>I told them that the Romans do not do it that way. They do not punish a man until he has met those who talk against him. Then he has a chance to speak for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>So they came here with me. I did not wait. The very next day I sat on my chair in the court and had the man brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>When they stood up, they did not say the wrong things against him that I thought they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>But instead, they had a quarrel with him about the things they believe in. The quarrel is about a man named Jesus who died. Paul said he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>I did not know how to judge such things. So I asked if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul asked to wait and let Caesar judge his case. So I had him put in prison to be kept there until I can send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Agrippa said to Festus, I should like to hear the man myself. Festus said, Tomorrow you shall hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came, making a big show of themselves. They went into the room to hear Paul talk. Officers and the leading men of the city also went in.  When Festus called for Paul, he was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Then Festus said, King Agrippa and all you men here with us, you see this man. All the Jewish leaders, both in Jerusalem and here, came together and talked about him. They shouted, "He must die!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I found out that he had not done anything wrong for which he should die. He himself asked to go to Caesar, so I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>But I have no real complaint about him to write to my ruler. So I have brought this man before you all, and most of all before you, king Agrippa. When you have heard him, I hope I will have something to write about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>I think that it does not make sense to send a prisoner and not say what wrong he has done.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You may speak for yourself. So Paul put out his hand and began to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>King Agrippa, I am happy to speak for myself before you today. I will talk about all the things the leaders of the Jews have said against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>You know all the ways of the Jews. You know what they believe. So please take time to listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>All the Jews know the way I lived from the time I was young. From the beginning I lived with my own people at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>They have known me for a long time. They know, if they would tell it, that I lived like the Pharisee group. They obey the law better than any others who worship God the way we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>I believe that God will keep the promise that he made to our fathers long ago. That is why I am standing here being judged today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>All the people of our twelve tribes serve God faithfully day and night. They do this because they believe they will receive what he has promised. Because I believe this, king Agrippa, the Jewish leaders are talking against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it so hard for any of you to believe that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I used to think that I must do many things against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>I did this in Jerusalem. The chief priests gave me power. I put many of Gods people in prison. And when they were killed, I agreed to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>Often I punished them in all the meeting places. I tried to make them say wrong things about Christ. I was very, very angry. I even went to other cities to trouble them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And so I was on my way to the city of Damascus. The chief priests had given me power and a letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>I was on the road at midday, king Agrippa, and I saw a bright light. It came from the sky and was brighter than the light of the sun. It shone all around me and the men who were travelling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>We all fell to the ground. I heard someone say to me in the Jews language, "Saul, Saul,  why are you troubling me? You hurt yourself when you kick against the sticks which guide you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>I said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, the one you are troubling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But get up. Stand on your feet. Here is why I have shown myself to you. I have chosen you to work for me. I have chosen you to tell people what you saw when you saw me today. You are to tell them also about the other times when I will show myself to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>I will keep you safe from your own people, the Jews. And I will keep you safe from those who are not Jews. I am sending you to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>I send you to them to open their eyes. Then they will turn from darkness to light. You are to take them out of Satans power and turn them to God, to be forgiven of their wrong ways. Then they will be among those who are made clean and pure by believing in me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>So, king Agrippa, I obeyed what the one from heaven told me to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>I told the good news to the people of Damascus and Jerusalem. Then I told it all over Judea. I went to those who are not Jews. I told everyone that they must stop doing wrong things and turn to God. I told them they must show by the way they live that they have stopped doing wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>That is why the leaders of the Jews caught me in the temple and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>God has always helped me up to today. I have stood and talked to both small people and great people. I have said nothing more than what the prophets and Moses said would happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>They said Christ must suffer. They said he would be the first person to rise from death.  He would be the first person to bring news of light to the Jews and those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>While Paul was saying these things Festus shouted, Paul, you are crazy! All your book learning is making you crazy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>Paul said, No, great ruler Festus, I am not crazy. But what I say is true. It makes good sense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>The king knows about these things. I am not afraid to talk to him about them. I am sure that not one of these things happened without his knowing about it. This did not happen in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are trying to make me a Christian right away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Right away or later, said Paul. I wish that all who hear me today might be what I am.  That is, what I am without these chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Then king Agrippa stood up. Festus and Bernice and those who were sitting there with them stood up also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>They left the room and talked the matter over. They said, This man is not doing anything wrong for which he ought to be in prison or die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Agrippa said to Festus, We could let this man go free if he had not asked to go to Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>It was planned that we would go by boat to Italy. An officer named Julius was put in charge of Paul and some other prisoners. Julius was an army captain in the Augustan group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>We got on a boat which was from the city of Adramyttium. This boat was going along the coast of Asia Minor. And so we went out to sea. A man named Aristarchus from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia came with us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we stopped at the city of Sidon. Julius was kind to Paul. He allowed him to go to see his friends so they could care for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Then we started out to sea again. We went near the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>We crossed the sea by the countries of Cilicia and Pamphylia. Then we reached the city of Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the officer found a boat from the city of Alexandria going to the country of Italy.  So he put us on that boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>We went slowly for many days. And after much trouble, we reached the city of Cnidus.  The wind was blowing hard against us. We could not go on. So we went around the south side of the island of Crete, past Cape Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>We had trouble going along near the coast, but at last we came to a place called Fair Havens. This was near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>It was now so late in the year that it was a bad time to go by boat. So Paul spoke to them about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>He said, Sirs, I see that if we go on by boat, we will have much trouble. Something bad will happen to the things on the boat and to the boat itself, and also to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>The officer did not listen to what Paul said. But he listened to the captain and the owner of the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>This place was not a good place for the boat to stay through the winter months of the year. So most of the men wanted to go on. They thought they might be able to reach Phoenicia and stay there for the winter. Phoenicia is a good place on the island of Crete.  Boats can stay there. The winds do not blow against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>When the south wind began to blow a little, they thought they had what they wanted. So they started off. They went along very close to the land of Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But soon a very strong north-east wind blew from Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>The wind blew against the boat and it could not go into the wind. So they let the boat go where the wind took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>We came close to a small island called Clauda. There we had a hard time to pull up the small boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>However, at last they got it up. Then they put ropes around the boat to make it strong.  They were also afraid they would get stuck in a bad place in the sand. So they took down the big sail cloth that was up to catch the wind. Then they let the boat go where the wind took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>The next day the storm was very bad. They threw out the things that were in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day they threw off the things they used on the boat, with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>For many days we could not see the sun or the stars. The bad storm kept on. We did not think that we would be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>The men of the boat had not eaten anything for a long time. Then Paul stood up and said,  Sirs, you should have listened to me and not left Crete. But you did leave. So you have had much trouble and have lost all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Now I tell you to be glad. Not one of you will die. Only the boat will break and be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>I belong to God and worship him. Last night his angel stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>He said, "Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And see, God has given you the lives of all these men who are travelling with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>So be glad, sirs. I believe God. It will be just the way he told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>However, we will have to go on an island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>On the fourteenth night we were being blown across the Adrian Sea. About midnight the boatmen thought that we must be near some land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>So they tested how deep the water was there. They found that the line went down twenty arm lengths. A little later they tested and found that it was only fifteen arm lengths deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then they were afraid that we would hit the rocks. There were four heavy iron hooks called anchors. They let them down into the water at the back end of the boat. Then they wished that morning would come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>The boatmen wanted to get off and leave the boat. They even put down the small boat into the water. They said they were going to put more anchors out from the front of the big boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>But Paul said to the officer and soldiers, If these men do not stay on the boat, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the small boat and let the water carry it away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>When it was almost morning, Paul begged them all to eat. He said, Today is the fourteenth day that you have been watching and have not eaten anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>So now, I beg you, eat something. You need it to make you strong so you can save yourselves. Not one of you will lose even one hair from your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>When he had said this, he stood in front of them all. He took some bread and thanked God for it. Then he broke it and began to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then they all were glad and ate some food themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>In all, we were 276 people on the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>They ate all they wanted. Then they threw the grain into the water, so that the boat would not be so heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>In the morning they saw land. But they did not know what country it was. They saw a sandy place. So they talked it over and thought they would try to get the boat on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>They cut off the anchors and left them in the water. At the same time, they untied the wood that guided the boat. They put up the big sail to catch the wind and tried to get the boat onto that sandy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But they came to a place where there was sand under the water. The boat stuck in it.  The front end stuck so badly that they could not make it go. The back end began to break up because the water beat it so hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners so that none of them would swim to land and run away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the officer wanted to save Paul, so he stopped the soldiers. He told the people,  Those of you who can swim, jump into the water first and get to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>Then the rest of you jump in and go on planks and other pieces of the boat. So in this way they all got to the land safely.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we were safe on land, we found that the island we were on was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The people there were very kind to us. They made a fire for us and took care of us. It was cold and raining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul gathered some sticks of wood. He put them on the fire. A bad snake came out of the heat and hung onto his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>The people of Malta saw the snake hanging on his hand. Oh, they said to each other.  This man has no doubt killed someone. He did not die in the water, but it is not right for him to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>Paul shook the snake off into the fire. It did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>The people thought surely he would swell up or would drop down dead at once. They waited a long time and saw that nothing bad happened to him. Then they said, We were wrong. He must be a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>The ruler of the island was a man named Publius. He owned some of the land there. He took us to his house for three days and was very kind to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>The father of Publius was sick with fever, and blood was coming from his body. Paul went to see him. He talked to God and put his hands on the man. He healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this, other sick people on the island came to Paul. And they too were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They gave us many things. When we went away, they put on the boat for us the things that we would need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>A boat from the town of Alexandria was at the island all through the winter time. It was marked with a sign of the Twin Brothers. After we had been on the island for three months, we went on that boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>Then we went to the city of Syracuse and stayed for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>After that we turned the boat along the coast. We reached the town of Rhegium. When we had been there for a day, a south wind began to blow. On the second day we came to the city of Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>There we found some Christian brothers. They asked us to stay with them for seven days. Then we went to Rome. Some of the Christians at Rome had heard about us. They came to places called the Market Place of Appius and the Three Hotels. There they met us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God. It made him strong and glad to see these brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we came to Rome, Paul was allowed to stay in a house by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>After three days, Paul called for the leaders of the Jews at Rome. When they had come,  he said to them, My brothers, I have done nothing against our people. I have obeyed the laws of our fathers. And yet I was made a prisoner at Jerusalem and was given over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>When the Romans judged my case in court, they wanted to let me go free. They said there was no reason to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But the Jewish leaders did not agree to let me go free, so I had to ask to be brought before Caesar. I did not have anything to say against my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Now, here is why I have asked to see you and to talk to you. I am a prisoner tied with chains because I believe the same promise the Jews believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him, The people of Judea have not written us any letter about you. When our brother Jews have come here, not one of them has told or said anything wrong about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we want to hear from you what you think. We know that people everywhere are talking against this Christian group.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they chose a certain day. On that day many of them came to the house where Paul was staying. He told them about Gods kingdom. He tried to make them understand about Jesus by the things that were written in the law of Moses and in the books of the prophets. He talked from morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some of the people were ready to believe what he said, but others did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>They did not agree among themselves. So they started to go away. But before they left,  Paul said one more thing. What the Holy Spirit said was right. He spoke to your fathers long ago through Isaiah, the prophet of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>He said, "Go to these people and say, You will hear but never understand. You will look but never see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>The hearts of these people have become hard. They do not hear with their ears. They have shut their eyes. They do not want to see with their eyes. They do not want to hear with their ears. They do not want to understand with their hearts. If they did, they would turn back to me and I would forgive them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Paul said, Therefore know this. The message that God will save them has been sent to those who were not Jews. They will listen to it.</verse>
