        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>I am Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. He called me to be an apostle and to tell Gods good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>Through his prophets long ago God promised this good news to people, in the holy writings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>The good news was about his Son. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. He was a man born in Davids family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>He came alive from death. That showed he was Gods Son. He had Gods power. Gods Holy Spirit did all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>This same Jesus Christ was kind to me. And he made me an apostle. I am sent in his name so that people in all nations will obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>You are some of them. You were called to belong to Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>I send greetings to all the Christians who live in the city of Rome. God loves you and has called you to be his people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you. In their kindness may they give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>People in all the world have heard that you believe. I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>God knows that I always talk to him about you. I worship him in my heart while I tell the good news about his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>I ask God that in some way now I may be able to visit you, if he wishes me to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>I want very much to see you. I want to give you some gift from the Holy Spirit to make you stronger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>I mean to say that we will both be helped. I will be helped because you believe, and you will be helped because I believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>My brothers, I want you to know that I have often planned to come to you. But something has stopped me until now. I planned to come so that I might see good things happen among you. I have done this in the other nations which are not Jewish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>This is something I must do for the Greek people and for all other people. I must do it for people who are wise and for people who are not wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>That is why I want so much to tell the good news to you people in the city of Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>I am not ashamed of the good news of Jesus Christ. The good news is the power God uses to save every one who believes. The good news was for the Jews first, but also for those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>The good news shows how God puts a person right. God puts a person right when that person believes in his Son and keeps on believing. The holy writings say, A person who is put right because he believes, will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>God is angry. He has shown it from heaven. He is angry because of all the bad and wrong things people do. These people hold back Gods truth by the wrong things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>They know about God. God himself has shown them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>People cannot see that God has power which lasts for ever. They cannot see that he is really God. But ever since he made the world, he has clearly shown this by the things he made. So they cannot say, I did not know about God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Even though they knew he was God, they did not worship him as God. They did not thank him. Their thoughts were no good. Their foolish minds became dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>They said they were wise people, but they were foolish people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>They did not worship God who cannot die. But they worshipped things made to look like a man who does die. They worshipped things made to look like birds and animals and snakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>So God left them to do the things their hearts wanted to do. They did the things that are not right to do with their bodies. They did not respect their own bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>They would not believe what was true about God. They believed a lie. They worshipped and worked for something that was made by God. They did not worship God-God who made all things. He is the one to worship for ever. Amen. May it be so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>That is why God left them to do the wrong things they wanted to do. Their women left the right way for women and did things that are wrong for women to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>Their men also left the right way with women. They wanted to have sex with one another. They did wrong things with other men. Their own bodies were punished because of the wrong things they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>They did not want to know God. So he left them to their wrong thoughts and to do things that are not right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>They were very bad. They did every kind of wrong thing. They were greedy. They hated people. They were very jealous. They killed many people. They fought. They fooled people. They told lies about people. They carried stories from one person to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>They said wrong things about people. They hated God. They did not respect people.  They were proud. They talked big. They even thought of new wrong things to do. They did not obey their parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>.They were foolish. They did not do what they said they would do. They did not love people. They were not kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>They know that God says that people who do such things should die. Even so, they not only do them, but they praise other people who do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Do you judge another people? You your-selves have done wrong things. So when you judge others, you judge yourselves, because you do the same things. You judge them and yet you do the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>We know that God judges people who do such things. And he judges them by what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Man, you judge people who do such things and yet you do them yourself. Do you think that God will not judge you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you not respect him for being kind, very patient, and for waiting a long time? Do you not know that God is kind, and he wants to lead you away from doing wrong things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But your hearts are hard. You will not stop. That is why God will be angry with you. He will be angry on the day when people will see that he judges in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>He will pay every man for what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>He will give life for ever to people who keep on doing good. These people want to have glory and honour from God, and to live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But God will be very angry with the people who think of themselves first before others.  They do not obey what is right. They do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Every one who does what is wrong will have much trouble and a hard time. This will happen to the Jews first, then to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>And every one who does what is good, will be made great. He will have honour and peace. This will happen to the Jews first and then to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>God does not love some people more than others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>All those who do not know the law &lt;FI&gt;of God given to Moses&lt;Fi&gt; and did what was wrong,  will die. But they will not be judged by the law. All those who know the law and did what was wrong will be judged by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(God does not say people are good because they have heard the law. But people who obey the law will be called good people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>Some people do not have the law. But they do what the law says because their own hearts tell them to. They have a law of their own, even though they do not know the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>They show that the law is written in their hearts. They know what is right to do and what is wrong to do. Their own thoughts tell them they have done what is wrong or what is not wrong.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>This will be on the day when God judges the things men have kept secret. Jesus Christ will be the judge. That is part of the good news I tell people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But you call yourselves Jews. You believe the law. You are proud of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>You know what he wants people to do. You know the thoughts that are good because you have been taught the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>You are sure that you can lead people who are like blind men. You are like a light for people who are in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>You are sure that you can tell foolish people what is right. You can teach people who are like children. You know what you need to know and you know what is true because you have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You teach another person. Do you not teach yourself? You say people must not steal. Do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You say people must not commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You hate idols. Do you steal things from the houses of idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You are proud that you have the law. Do you break the law, and in that way show you do not honour God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>The holy writings say, People who are not Jews say wrong things about the name of God. They do it because of what you Jews do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision of the body is a good thing if you obey the law. But if you break the law,  you are like a man who has not been circumcised with this mark of the Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>So if a man who has not been circumcised obeys the law, will he not be like a man who has been circumcised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>Some people have not been circumcised, but they obey the law. They will show that you should be punished. You have the written law and you have been circumcised, and yet you break the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>If a person is a Jew only on the outside, he is not really a Jew. And true circumcision is not something that is done on the outside of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>If a person is a Jew inside, he is really a Jew. It is God who praises him, not people. True circumcision is done in the heart. It is in the spirit, not in the body. Such people are not praised; but God praises them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>Then what does a Jew have that others do not have? Or what good is it if a person has been circumcised?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>It is much better in every way. First, Gods law was given to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>But some Jews did not keep his law. Does that mean that God cannot be trusted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>No, it does not mean that. God must be true, even if every man is not true. The holy writings say this about God: People will see that you are right in what you say. You will be without fault when you are judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>When we do wrong things, we show that God is right. What shall we say about that?  Does God do wrong when he punishes us? (I speak the way people would think about it.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>No, he does not. If he did wrong, how could he judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>Maybe I say what is not true. And that makes people praise God more because he is true.  Then why does God still judge me and say I have done wrong?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Some people say wrong things about us. They say that we say, Let us do wrong things so that good things will happen. People who say such things should be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>So what shall we say? Are we Jews any better than other people? No, we are not! I have already shown that all men, both Jews and people who are not Jews have done wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>The holy writings say, No one is good. No, not one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>No one is wise. No one wants to know God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They all have turned away from the straight road. Together they have gone the wrong way. No one does good, not even one person!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their mouth is like an open grave. They have used their tongues to fool people. The poison of bad snakes is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Their mouths are full of cursing and saying bad words to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet run quickly to kill people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Death and trouble are on the ways they go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>They do not know the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>They do not fear God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>We know that everything the law says, it says to the people who have the law. Then no one can say a word for themselves. All the people in the world will be brought to God to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>No one will be put right with God because he has tried to obey the law. The law only makes people know what they have done wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>So now God has shown how people can be put right with him without the law. The law and the prophets said he would do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>God puts people right with himself when they believe in Jesus Christ. He does this for all who believe. They are all alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>All have done wrong and all are far from being as good as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>But God is kind and makes them right with himself. It is a gift. He does it because Christ Jesus paid the price to set them free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>God gave him as a sacrifice. When people believe in him, his blood pays for the wrong things they have done. This shows that God is good and right. He was right when he forgave the wrong things that people did long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>God also shows that he is right now. He does this when he makes right any person who believes in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Then what have we to be proud of? Nothing at all. Why not? Does God put us right with himself because of anything we have done? No. He does it because we believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We know that if a person believes in Christ, God makes him right again. It is not because that person has obeyed the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of other people also? Yes, he is.  There is only one God of all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>He will put right people who have been circumcised &lt;FI&gt;the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; because they believe. And he will also put right people who are not circumcised when they believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>When we believe, does that make the law no good to us? No. That is not so. When we believe, we show that the law is right.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>So what shall we say about Abraham? He is the father of our family on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>If Abraham was put right with God, because of what he did, he has something to be proud of. But he has nothing to be proud of when he stands before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>What do the holy writings say? It says, Abraham believed God. And God said that he was a good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>When a person works, his pay is not a gift to him. His pay belongs to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But no person can work to put himself right with God. It is God alone who makes a bad person right. The one who believes in him-even a bad person is put right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>David also says that God blesses a man. God calls him a good man but not because he has kept the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>David said, God blesses people who have been forgiven the wrong things they have done. God covers over the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>The Lord blesses people when he forgets the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does God bless only people who have been circumcised? Or does he also bless those who are not? We say, because Abraham believed God, God called him a good man. His faith made him right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>When did God say that? Was it when Abraham was circumcised? Or was it before? It was not when he was circumcised: it was before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>Abraham was circumcised as a sign. It was a sign that he was a good man, because he believed when he was not yet circumcised. That makes him the father of all people who believe, even those who are not circumcised. God says they are good people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>That makes him also the father of those who are circumcised. I mean people who are circumcised and do as our father Abraham did. Even when he was not circumcised, he believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>God promised Abraham and his family that the world would belong to them. God did not make the promise because Abraham obeyed the law. But he made the promise because Abraham believed him and was put right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>If the world will belong to people who obey the law, it is of no use to believe God. And the promise is no good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Because of the law, God is angry. Where there is no law, no one breaks the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>That is why people must believe. Because God is kind, he makes the promise sure for all of Abrahams children. The promise is for those who have the law and also for those who believe as Abraham did. He is the father of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>the holy writings say, I have made you the father of many nations. Abraham was made the father of many nations by God. He believed God. He believed that God could make dead people live. He believed God when he said that things were true even though they had not happened yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Abraham believed and hoped, though there was nothing to give him hope. He believed that he would become the father of many nations. God had told him this would happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>He did not stop believing when he thought about his own body. It was almost dead. He was about one hundred years old. He did not stop believing when he thought about Sarah, even though she had never given birth to any children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>He did not stop believing Gods promise. He believed God very much. He did not praise God for his own faith, but for Gods promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>He was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>He was put right with God because he believed the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>The holy writings do not say that for Abraham only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>They say it for us too. God will say we are put right if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>He was killed because we did wrong things. He was raised from death in order that we might be made right with God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>We are made good people and put right with God when we believe in Jesus Christ. So now we have peace with God because of what our Lord Jesus Christ did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>Because we believe, Christ has brought us to the place where God can do us good. We are in that place now. We are very happy because we have the hope that we shall see Gods greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only is that true, but we are very happy in our troubles, because we know that trouble makes us stronger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>When we are strong to take trouble, we prove that we believe. When we prove that we believe, we have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>We will not be disappointed by this hope. God has given us the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has put Gods love in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>We could not help ourselves. So at the right time, Christ died to save us bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Almost no one would die to save even a good man. But perhaps someone would die to save a very good man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>God shows his love for us in this way: Christ died to save us while we were bad people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>The blood of Christ has now put us right with God. So even more, he will save us from Gods strong anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>When we were enemies, the death of his Son brought us back to God. Now that we are made right with God, it is the life of Jesus that will save us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>Not only is that true, but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ that we can enjoy God. This is for all who have been brought back to God by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>One man &lt;FI&gt;Adam&lt;Fi&gt; did a wrong thing. And the wrong thing he did made him die. So all men die because all have done wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>People in the world were not right with God before he gave the law. But wrong things are not punished when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death ruled over people from Adams time to Moses time. It even ruled over the people who were not as wrong as Adam. Adam was like a person who would come later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift is not like the wrong thing. Many people died because one man did a wrong thing. This is sure. God was very kind and he gave a free gift. This gift was given to many people because one man, Jesus Christ, did a very kind thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>The free gift is not like the wrong thing one man did. Because of that one man people were judged. And they were punished. Because many people did wrong things, God gave his free gift and many people were made right with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>One man did a wrong thing. And so death ruled over people because of that one man.  God has been kind to people and given them his free gift. That gift is to make people right with God. People who take that gift will live and rule because of one man, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>One man did a wrong thing. And so all people were punished through him. But Christ did the right thing. And so all people can have the free gift of life through being put right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>One man did not obey. And so many people were bad people. One man obeyed. And so many people will be made right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>When the law came, it showed how wrong people really were. But when people were really bad, God was even more kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>The wrong things people did ruled over them, and they died. Now God has been very kind. He has made people right with him. So now Gods blessing will rule over them, and they will live for ever. Jesus Christ our Lord has done this for them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we keep on doing wrong things so that God will be more kind to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>No, surely not! We died to our wrong ways and no longer live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>All of us have been baptised in water. This means we are joined to Christ Jesus. We were baptised into his death. Do you know that?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried when he was buried because we were baptised into his death. Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father. So we also must live a new life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>Have we shared with Christ and died as he died? Then we shall share with him by rising from death as he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>We know this is true. The old person we used to be was nailed to the cross with him, so that our bodies which do wrong things would die. Then we will no longer be like slaves to the wrong things we used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>Anyone who has died no longer does wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>If we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>We know that Christ was raised from death and will not die again. Death has no power over him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>He died. And he died once for all time, so that people would stop their wrong ways. But now he lives. And he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So you also must think you are dead, and stop your wrong ways. And you must think you are living for God along with Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Do not let wrong things rule over your bodies that are going to die. Do not do the things your bodies want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Do not use your bodies to do wrong things. But give yourselves to God like men who have been raised from death to life. Give your bodies to God and use them to do good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>Wrong ways will not be your masters. The law does not rule over you now, but Gods loving kindness rules over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? The law does not rule over us now. Gods loving kindness rules over us. So,  shall we do wrong things? No, never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>If you give yourselves to be slaves and obey your master, you are not free. You are his slaves. Do you not know this: you may be slaves to wrong things? But you will not live for ever. Or you may be slaves to obey God. Then you will be made good people and live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>You were at one time slaves to wrong things. But I praise God that you obeyed what your teachers taught you. And you obeyed because you wanted to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>You were made free from doing wrong things. You were made slaves to good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak the way people would think about such things, because your minds are weak. At one time you gave your bodies to be slaves to your unclean ways, and to do more and more wrong things. So now give your bodies to be slaves to doing what is right, and to being good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>When you were slaves to wrong things, you were free from doing good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>You are now ashamed of those things. What good did they do you? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now you have been made free from wrong ways and you have been made Gods slaves. You are made good and you will live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>The reward that wrong ways give is to die. But the gift which God gives is to live for ever.  Christ Jesus our Lord has done this for us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>My brothers, I am saying this to you people who know the law. Do you not know that the law is master over a person only while he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>A married woman belongs to her husband by law as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law that made her belong to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So if she belongs to another man while her husband is living, she commits adultery. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then if she belongs to another man, she does not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>In the same way my brothers, you died when Christ died. And you are free from the law.  Now you belong to another person. You belong to the one who has been raised from death. Because of that, we are able to do what God wants us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>One time we lived in the way our bodies wanted to live. The law made us think about doing wrong things. And we did things that made us die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we have been made free from the law. We died, and so we are no longer slaves to the one who was our master. Now we are slaves to God in our new life. This new life is ruled by the Spirit. We do not work for the old written law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>So what shall we say? Shall we say that the law is bad? No! I would not have known what is wrong if there had been no law. The law says, Do not want to take other peoples things. That is how I know it is wrong to want another persons things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>My wrong ways used the law to make me want all kinds of things. When there is no law,  the thing within me that wants to do wrong is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>Once I had no law, and I lived. But when the law came, that which wanted to do wrong things came to life, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>The same law which was meant to make a person live, made me die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>My wrong ways used the law to fool me and kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So the law is holy. And what the law says is holy and right and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>So did that good thing make me die? No. The wrong things I did made me die, because that good thing showed they were wrong. And the law shows that the wrong things are very, very bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>We know that the law came from the Holy Spirit. But I am a weak man. I have been sold like a slave to do wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>I do not know why I do the things I do. I do not do what I want to do. But I do the things I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>So now it is no longer I who do it, but my wrong ways in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>I know that no good thing lives in me. I mean, no good thing lives in my body. I want to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>I do not do the good thing I want to do, but I do the wrong thing that I do not want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>If I do the thing I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the wrong thing in me that does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>So there is a law I find that it is at work in me. When I want to do what is right, I can only do what is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>In my own mind I am glad to obey the law of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see that in my body there is another law fighting against the law in my mind. And that makes me like a prisoner to the law of wrong things in my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>I am a very sad man. Who will save me from this body that will make me die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Thank God for Jesus Christ our Lord who will do it! So this is the way it is. In my mind I am a slave to do the law of God, but in my body I am a slave to do the law of wrong things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>So now those who belong to Christ Jesus will not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>The Spirit gives life in Christ Jesus. And the law of the Spirit has set me free from the law of wrong things, and the law of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>God has done what the law could not do. The things people did made the law weak. God sent his own Son in a body of man. His body was like the bodies which others use to do wrong things. He sent him because people have done wrong things. And he judged the wrong things people have done in their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>He did this so that we might be good people as the law said we should be. We are good people if we live the way the Spirit wants us to live, not the way our bodies want to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>Some people live the way their bodies want to live. They think only about the things their bodies want to do. Other people live the way the Spirit wants them to live. They think about the things the Spirit wants them to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>If you keep your mind on the things your bodies want to do, you will die. But if you keep your mind on the things the Spirit wants, you will live and have peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>People who think about the things of this life are Gods enemies. They do not obey Gods law. They cannot obey it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>People who do what their bodies want cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>Does Gods Spirit live in you? If he does, then you are not living the way the body wants,  but you are living the way the Spirit wants. If anyone does not have Christs Spirit, he does not belong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of the wrong things you have done.  But your spirits live because you have been made right with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>God raised Christ Jesus from death. Does Gods Spirit live in you? Then God will also give life to your bodies which die. He does this through his Spirit who lives in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So, my brothers, we must not live the way our bodies want us to live. We must not be ruled by our wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>If you live the way your bodies wants to live, you will die. But if, by the help of the Spirit,  you stop doing the wrong things your bodies want to do, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>All who do what Gods Spirit leads them to do are Gods sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>The Holy Spirit you have received does not make you a slave again so that you are afraid.  But the Spirit you have received makes you sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>So we say, Father! Father! The Spirit himself also, along with our own spirits, tells us that we are Gods children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>If we are his children, God will give us the good things that children receive. He will give us these blessings along with Christ. He will give it to us if we suffer with Christ. If we suffer with Christ, we will also be made great with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>I think that the troubles we have in this life are nothing when we think of the great things that we shall have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>The whole world is waiting for the time when the sons of God will be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>The world was spoiled. It did not want to be spoiled, but God allowed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>And it hoped to be free like Gods children when they are made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>We know that the whole world has been crying. It has had much pain until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not the world only, but we ourselves also cry out. We have the first blessing God gives of his Spirit. But we cry out in our hearts. We are waiting for God to finish making us his sons. Then our bodies will be set free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>That is what we hoped for when we were saved. When the thing hoped for is seen, there is no more hoping. When a person sees a thing, how can he hope for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for something we do not see, we keep on waiting for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Also the Spirit helps us because we are weak. We do not know how we should talk to God. But the Spirit himself talks to God for us, while we cry and cannot say any words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>God looks to see what is in peoples hearts. And he knows what the Spirit is going to do.  The Spirit talks to God for Gods people. And he asks for them what God wants them to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>We know that God works out everything for the good of those who love him. They are the people who are part of his plan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>He knew all along that he would choose them. He chose them to be made like his Son.  Then his Son would be the first one of many brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>He chose them and he also called them. He called them to himself as if they had never been bad people. He made them right with himself and he also made them great in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>So what shall we say about this? If God is on our side, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He did not keep his own Son, but gave him up for us all. Because he has given him to us,  will he not also give us all other things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will say anything against Gods chosen people? For it is God himself who says they have been put right with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who will say they are not right? Jesus Christ died. Yes, he was raised from death. He is at the right side of God. And he talks to God for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who can take us away from Christs love? We may have trouble. We may have hard times. People may make us suffer because we believe. We may have no food to eat and no clothes to wear. We may be in danger. We may be killed with big knives. Can any of these things take us away from Christs love?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>The holy writings say, For your sake we are killed all day. We are like sheep ready to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But Christ loved us. He has helped us to win great victory in all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>I know this. Death, life, angels, rulers, things happening now, things that will happen,  high things, low things; nothing else in all the world can come between us and Gods love in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>What I say is true and Christ knows it is. I do not tell a lie. My heart tells me it is true.  And the Holy Spirit knows this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>I am very sad. I am always troubled. 3I could almost wish I were taken away from Christ for the sake of my brothers, the people of my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>They are Jews. God gave them the right to be his sons. He showed them how great he is.  He made agreements with them. He gave them the law. He told them how to worship him. He gave them the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>The great men were their fathers. Christ was born a Jew. He is God over all. Praise him for ever! Yes, he is!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>God will do what he said he would do. Not all who are Jews belong to the real Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>Not all the people in Abrahams family are his children. But the holy writings say, It is Isaacs family who will be called your family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>This means that not all who were born in Abrahams family are Gods children. God promised Abraham a son &lt;FI&gt;Isaac&lt;Fi&gt; . His children &lt;FI&gt;the Jews&lt;Fi&gt; are the ones that God called Abrahams true family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>For this is what God promised, About this time next year I will come and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>When the children were not yet born, they had done nothing good or bad. God chooses the people he wants. He does not choose people because of what they have done. He chooses people who will answer his call. So he said to Rebecca, The older one will be a slave of the younger one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>The holy writings also say, I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>So what shall we say? Does God do what is not right? No, never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>He says to Moses, I will be kind to a person if I choose to be kind to him. I will share in the suffering of others if I choose to be sorry for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>God is not kind to a person because the person wants God to be kind to him. God is not kind to him because the person runs to him to ask him for help. God is kind because he chooses to be kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>In the holy writings it says to Pharaoh, That is why I made you live. I wanted to show my power through you. I wanted people to know about me all over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>So God is kind to any person if he wants to be kind to him. And God makes a mans heart hard if he wants to do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So you will ask me, Why does God still blame us? Who can fight against what God has planned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>But you are only a man. Will you tell God what to do? Can the pot say to the man who made it, Why did you make me like this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>The person who makes pots has power over the mud. He can make two different pots out of one pile of mud. One pot will be fine and another will not be fine. Can the potter not make them so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>God has a right to be very angry if he wants to be. He has the right to show his power.  God was very angry with some people who deserved to die. And yet he waited a long time before he did anything to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>He did it to show how very great he is. He was kind to some people. He planned for them to be made great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>That means he also called us. He called not only those who are Jews, but also those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>In the book written long ago by the prophet Hosea, God says They were not my people.  But I will call them "my people". I did not love her, but I will call her "the one I love."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>But how can people call someone if they have not believed in him? And how can they believe in him if they have not heard about him? And how can they hear about him if no one tells them about him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how can people tell about him if no one sends them? The holy writings say, How good are the feet of those who bring the good news of peace and happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the good news. It is as Isaiah said it would be, Lord, who has believed what we have told them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So people believe because they hear. They hear because people tell them about Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have. The holy writings say, Their voice has gone out all over the earth. And their words have gone out all over the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I ask, did not the Jews know? First the book of Moses says, I will make you jealous through people who are not a nation like the Jews. I will make you angry through people who do not even know or understand these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But the book of Isaiah says even stronger words. The people who did not look for me have found me. I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But he says about the Jews, All day I held out my hands to a people who did not obey me, who said wrong things against me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>So I ask, has God left his people? No, he has not! I myself am a Jew. I was born in Abrahams family. I belong to the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not left his people whom he knew from the first. Do you not know what the holy writings say about the prophet Elijah? He talked to God against the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>He said, Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have pulled down your holy places.  I am the only one that is left, and they are trying to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what did God answer him? He said, I have seven thousand men who have not kneeled down to the idol god Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So now some are left because God was kind to them, and chose them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>But if it was a gift because he was kind to them, then it was no longer because of the things they did. Or else a gift would no longer be a gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>So what does that mean? The Jews did not get what they tried to get. Only the people God chose got it. The hearts of the rest of the people became hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>The holy writings say, God made them dull with sleep. He gave them eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear. They have been like that until today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>And David said long ago, May the table where they eat be like a net and like a trap. May it make them fall down. May it punish them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>Make their eyes become blind so that they cannot see. Make their backs bent all the time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>So I ask, Have their feet been caught so that they have really fallen down? No. But because they began to fall, the people who are not Jews were told how to be saved. That would make the Jews jealous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>The people who are not Jews have been richly blessed because the Jews failed. So it will be even better for them when the Jews no longer fail God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>Now I say this to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, so I think highly of the work I have been sent to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>I want the people of my own nation, the Jews, to be jealous. Then I may be able to save some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>God turned away from the Jews in order to bring the world back to himself. Then if that is true, when he takes the Jews back to himself, will not that be like making dead people live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>If the first piece of bread is holy, so is all the rest which came from the same bread mix.  If the root of a tree is holy, the branches are holy also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Maybe some of the trees branches were broken off. And you, a branch from a wild olive tree, were made to grow on the tree among the branches. You then have the good water that comes from the root of the olive tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>But do not think that you are better than the trees own branches. If you do, remember it is not you that holds the root in place. But it is the root that holds you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>Then you will say, The branches were broken off so that I might be joined to the tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>That is true. They were broken off because they did not believe. And you have your place only because you believe. So do not be proud, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>If God punished the trees own branches, he will punish you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>See how kind God is. And see how hard he is. He is hard on those who have fallen. But God is kind to you if you go on following in his ways. If you do not, you also will be broken off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>God will also put back the other branches if they believe. God is able to put the Jews back where they belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>You were cut off from a wild olive tree. And you were put on a good olive tree. That is not the way trees grow. But it can be done. And so, even more, the Jewish branches will be put back on their own olive tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>My brothers, I want you to know something that has been a secret. Then you will not be proud of yourselves. The secret is this. Some Jews will have hard hearts until the right number of other people have come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>Then all the Jews will be saved. The holy writings say, Someone will come from Zion to save people. He will take away the wrong ways of our father Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>This will be my agreement with them when I take away the wrong things they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>The Jews make themselves enemies of God because they do not want the good news of Jesus Christ. That helps you since the good news has then come to you. But God still loves the Jews because of the promise he made to their fathers long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>God does not change his gifts or his call to people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>At one time you did not obey God. But now he has been kind to you because the Jews did not obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>So now, they also have not obeyed him. But he will also be kind to them because he was kind to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>God allowed people to disobey him. He did it so that he might be kind and forgive all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>God is very kind. He is very wise. He knows much. No one can understand why he judges the way he does. No one can find out why he does the things he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>The holy writings say, Who has known what the Lord thinks? Who has ever told him what to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Who has given a gift to God first, so that God would give him something also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>All things come from God, through God, and return to God. Praise him for ever! Yes, it is so!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>God has given me this gift. So I say this to every one of you. Do not think you are better than you really are. But think of yourself as you are. You are what you are because God has given you something when you believed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>In the same way, we are many people. But we are one body because we are all joined together in Christ. Each one of us is a part of all the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>We have different gifts because God has blessed us in different ways. If a person can speak words from God, he must say what he believes he should say.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>But, If your enemy is hungry, give him food. If he is thirsty, give him a drink. When you do that, it will be as if you put a pile of coals from the fire on his head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>So anyone who fights against the ruler, fights against what God put there. And those who fight will be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>The rulers do not bring fear to a good man, but they bring fear to a bad man. If you do not want to be afraid of a ruler, do what is good and he will praise you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>Such a person is Gods servant and will do what is good for you. But if you do what is wrong, you should fear him. He has great power and he will use it. He is Gods servant and will punish those who do wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>So you must obey, not only because of the punishment, but because you know it is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>That is why you also pay taxes. The rulers serve God and they give all their time to their work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Pay them all that they should have. Pay taxes to the person who should have the taxes.  Pay money to the person who should have the money. Respect the people who should be respected. Honour a person who should be honoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Do not have any debts, but love each other. Anyone who loves his neighbour has done all that the law says we should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>The law says, Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not want things that belong to other people. These laws and others are all in this one law: Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything. And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does. God has accepted him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Why do you judge another persons servant? He stands or he falls before his own master.  But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man thinks, This day is better than that day. But another man thinks, All days are alike. Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord. The person who eats everything, eats it because he honours the Lord.  And he thanks God. And the person who will not eat every kind of food also does so to honour the Lord. And he still gives thanks to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>So we must not judge each other any longer. But it is better for us to judge this. Never put anything in a brothers way that will hurt him or that will make him fall down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>As a Christian, I know and believe that nothing in itself is not right to eat. But it is not right for anyone to eat who thinks it is not right to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>Does what you eat trouble your brother? If it does, you are no longer living in love. Do not destroy the faith of someone because of what you eat. Christ died for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>What is good for you must not be something that other people say is wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>The kingdom of God is not about what a person eats and drinks. But it is about living in a way which is right with God. It is peace. It is joy because a person has the Holy Spirit.</verse>
