        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Rev'>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>God showed these things to Jesus Christ to show to his servants. These are things that must happen soon. Then God sent his angel and showed them to John, his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>John wrote down what God said and what Jesus showed to him. These words tell all that He saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>God will bless the person who reads the words of this book. God will bless those who hear the words of this book and obey the things written in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>Here is what John wrote to the people of the seven churches which are in the country of Asia Minor: May Gods loving kindness bless you and give you peace. He lives now, he always has lived, and he will come again. May the seven Spirits bless you and give you peace. They stand in front of Gods throne &lt;FI&gt;chief chair of a king&lt;Fi&gt; .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>May Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. What he says is true. He was the first to rise from death. And he is ruler of the kings of the earth. He loves us. By his own blood &lt;FI&gt;death&lt;Fi&gt; he has made us free from the wrong things we have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>He has made us into kings and priests to his God and Father. Praise him! He is great and has power for ever! Yes, it is so!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Watch! He will come in the clouds. Every one will see him. Those who stuck a spear in him will also see him. All the tribes on earth will cry when they see him. That is the way it will be. Yes it will!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>The Lord God says, I am the First and the Last. I am the beginning and the ending. I live now. I always have lived, and I will come again. I have all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I am John, your brother. I belong to Jesus and I am having big trouble just as you are. I also belong to his kingdom and I wait patiently for it. I was on an island called Patmos because I told the word of God and talked about Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day. Behind me I heard a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet or horn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>The voice said, Write what you see in a book. Send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see who was talking to me. I saw seven gold lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>In the centre of the seven lamps I saw someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long gown with a wide, gold belt around his chest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>The hair on his head was white like sheeps hair, white as snow. His eyes shone like a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet shone like fine brass that has been made pure by fire. His voice was like the sound of much water flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In his right hand he had seven stars. Out of his mouth came a long knife or sword, sharp on both sides. His face shone like the sun when it is shining very brightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell down in front of him as if I had died. He put his right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am he who lives. I died. But look, I am alive for ever. I have the keys to death and to the world of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>So write what you have seen. Write the things that are now and the things that will happen after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>You saw seven stars in my right hand. I will tell you the secret meaning of them and of the seven gold lamps. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. The seven lamps are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Ephesus: Here are the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>He says, "I know the things you do. I know that you work hard and are patient. I know that you have nothing to do with bad men. You tested those who say they are messengers from God but are not. You proved that they are not true apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>I know that you are patient and are strong for my names sake. And you have not given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But here is what I say against you. You do not love as you loved at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>So remember what you were like at first. Stop! Live the way you did at first. If you do not, I will come and move your lamp from its place. I will do it if you do not stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this is good: you hate the things which the people called Nicolaitans do. I hate the things they do also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He says, "I will let the person who wins eat fruit from the tree of life. It grows in Gods garden."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Smyrna: Here are the words of the one who is the First and the Last. He is the one who died but lived again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>He says, "I know the things you do and the trouble you have. I know you are poor. But you are rich in some ways. I know some people do not respect God. They call themselves Jews. But they are not real Jews. They belong to Satans people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not be afraid of the troubles you will have. Yes, the devil will put some of you into prison where you will be tested. You will have trouble for ten days. But keep on believing, even if you have to die for it. I will give you life for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who can hear should listen to the message of the Spirit to the churches. He says,  "The person who wins will not be hurt by the second death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Pergamum: Here are the words of the one who has the long knife which is sharp on both sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>He says, "I know where you live. You live where Satan rules. But you keep my name and you have never said that you do not believe in me. You kept on believing in me even in the time of Antipas. He said he believed in me and was true to me. He was killed among you where Satan lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things to say against you. You have some people there who believe the teaching of Balaam. He showed Balak how to trick the people of Israel and make them do wrong. They ate food that was given to idols, and they used sex wrongly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>Also, you have people among you who believe the teaching of the Nicolaitans. I hate the things they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Stop! If you do not, I will come soon and I will fight against them with the long knife that comes from my mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He says, "I will give some of the secret food to the person who wins. And I will give him a white stone. A new name will be written on the stone. No one will know the name but the one who gets the stone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Thyatira: Here are the words of the Son of God. He is the one whose eyes shine like a flame of fire, and his feet shine like fine brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>He says, "I know the things you do. I know that you love me, believe in me, work for me, and are patient. I know that you do these things more now than you did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this to say against you. You let that woman named Jezebel keep on teaching.  She calls herself a prophet of God but teaches my servants wrong things. She fools them to use sex wrongly and eat food that has been given to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I gave her time to stop, but she will not stop her wrong sexual ways and turn back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Look, I will make her very sick, and also those who love her. I will do it if they do not stop what they are doing with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>I will kill her children. Then all the churches will know that I find out what is in a persons mind and heart. I will pay each one of you for the good or wrong things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But some of you in Thyatira do not listen to that womans teaching. You have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan. To you I say, I will put no other load on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>The only thing I say to you is to keep on believing until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>If a person wins and does what I want him to do until the end, I will make him rule with me over all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>The holy writings said this long ago: He will rule them with an iron stick. He will break them to pieces like pots made of clay. This is the same power as I received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Sardis: Here are the words of the one who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars. He says, "I know what you do. People say that you are alive, but you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Wake up! You still have a little life left in you. Make it stronger before it dies altogether. I have not seen you do anything that looked right to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>So remember the things you were told and the things you have heard. Obey them. Stop the things you have been doing. If you do not wake up, I will come to you like a thief.  You will not know when I will come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few people in Sardis who have not made their clothes dirty. They will walk with me in white clothes, because they are good enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who wins will wear white clothes. I will not take his name out of the book of life. I will tell his name to my Father and to his angels."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Philadelphia: Here are the words of the one who is holy and true. He has Davids key. No one will shut what he opens. And no one will open what he shuts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>He says, "I know what you do. Look, I have opened a door in front of you. No one can shut it. I know that you do not have much power. But you have obeyed my word and you have never said you did not believe in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Look! I will bring some people who belong to Satans group. They call themselves Jews,  but they are not real Jews. They lie. Look, I will make them come and kneel down in front of you. They will know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>You have obeyed my word and been patient. So I will keep you safe in the time of trouble which will come all over the world. It will test the people who live on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming again soon! Hold on to the faith which you have, so that no one will stop you receiving your reward in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>I will make the person who wins become a strong post in the temple of my God. I will keep him strong. He will never leave it again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my Gods city. This city is the new Jerusalem. It comes down out of heaven from my God. And I will write my new name on him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>Write this to the angel of the church people in Laodicea: Here are the words of the one whose name is Truth. What he says can be trusted. He is the one who began all that God made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>He says, "I know what you do. I know that you are neither cold nor hot. And I wish that you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So I will spit you out of my mouth, because you are only warm and not hot or cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>You say, I am rich and have many things. I need nothing. You do not know that you are in trouble and need help. You are poor. You are blind. And you have no clothes to wear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I tell you what you should do. You should buy from me gold that has been made clean by fire. Then you will be rich. And you should buy from me white clothes to wear. Then people will not see that you have no clothes, and you will not be ashamed. You should buy from me healing oil to put on your eyes. Then you will be able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>I tell off and punish the people I love. So get busy and stop doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Listen, I stand at the door and knock. If any one hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him. I will eat with him, and he will eat with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He who wins will sit with me on my throne in heaven. I won too, and I sat down with my Father on his throne."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After this, I looked and saw a door open in heaven. I heard the same voice that I had heard before. It was like the sound of a horn or trumpet. It said, Come up here. I will show you the things that must happen after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Right away, I was in the Spirit. I saw a throne or chief chair in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>The one who sat on the throne looked very fine and bright. He looked like fine stones called jasper and carnelian. All around his chair was a rainbow that looked like a fine stone called emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around his throne I saw twenty-four other thrones. On them sat twenty-four leaders.  They wore white clothes and had gold crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>From the throne came lightning, loud noises, and thunder. In front of the throne, seven bright lamps were burning. These lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>In front of the throne, it was like a sea of glass. It looked like a stone called crystal.  Around the throne on the four sides of it were four living beings. They had many eyes in their faces and in their back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living thing was like a lion. The second one was like a young cow. The third one had the face of a man. The fourth one was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>Each of the four living beings had six wings. They had many eyes all over their bodies and under their wings. They say all the time, day and night: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God. He has all power. He always has lived. He lives now. And he always will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>The living beings give praise and honour and thanks to the one who sits on the throne and lives for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>Every time they do this, the twenty-four leaders kneel down in front of the one who sits on the throne. And they worship the one who lives for ever and ever. They take the crowns off their heads and lay them down in front of his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>They say: Our Lord and God, it is right for you to have praise and honour and power.  You made all things. They were made and have life because you wanted them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>I saw a book in the right hand of the one who sat on the chief chair. It had writing on the front and the back. It was locked with seven locks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>I saw a strong angel calling with a loud voice. He said, Who can open the book and break its locks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the book or look in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>I cried very much because no one could open the book or look in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>Then one of the leaders said to me, Do not cry. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah has won! The One who was born into Davids family has won! He can open the book and break its seven locks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>I saw a Lamb standing in front of the throne and the four living beings, and in front of the leaders. It looked as if it had been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. They are the seven Spirits of God who are sent out all over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>He went and took the book from the right hand of the One who sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four leaders kneeled down in front of the Lamb. Every one of them had a harp and a gold bowl. The bowls were full of incense that smelled very sweet when it was burned. These bowls are the words of Gods people when they talk to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And the four living beings and the leaders sang a new song. The new song was: You are able to take the book and to open its locks, because you were killed. You have set the people free and bought them for God with the cost of your blood. They are from every tribe, language, nation, and country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>You have made them into kings and priests for our God. They will rule on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I saw and heard many angels. They were around the chair, and the living beings,  and the leaders. There were many, many thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>They said with a loud voice, The Lamb of God who was killed is the only one good enough to be given power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, praise, and blessing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>Then I heard everything in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything in them say, Blessing, honour, praise, and power belong for ever and ever to the One who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>Then the four living beings said, Amen! May it be so! And the leaders kneeled down and worshipped the One who lives for ever and ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>I saw the Lamb open one of the seven locks. I heard the voice of one of the four living beings call, Come! It sounded like thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked and saw a white horse. The man who rode on it had a bow to shoot arrows.  A gold crown for his head was given to him. And he went out fighting to win the victory over his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When the Lamb opened the second lock, I heard the second living being call, Come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out. It was red. The man who rode on it was allowed to take peace away from the earth, so that men would kill each other. The man who rode on it was given a long knife or sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When the Lamb opened the third lock, I heard the third living being call, Come! I looked and saw a black horse. The man who rode on it had scales in his hand to weigh things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard a voice among the four living beings. It said, Four cups of wheat for bread will sell for a days wages. Twelve cups of barley will sell for a days wages. But do not destroy the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the Lamb opened the fourth lock, I heard the fourth living being call, Come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I saw a horse the colour of ashes. The name of the man who rode it was Death. And the one who controls the world of the dead followed him. They were given power over a fourth part of the world. They could kill people with a sword, or by making them go without food to eat, or by making them sick, or with wild animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the Lamb opened the fifth lock, I saw the souls of people who had been killed.  They were under the holy table where incense is burned. They had been killed because they believed Gods word and said they believed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They called in a loud voice, Lord, you are holy and true. How long will you wait before you judge and punish the people on earth because they killed us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Then each one of them was given a white gown to wear. They were told to wait a little longer for the other Christian brothers. Those who worked with them for the Lord would be killed as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>I saw the Lamb opening the sixth lock. The earth shook very much. The sun became very dark, like the black cloth people wear to show they are sad. The full moon became red like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars in the sky fell to the earth. They fell like figs that are not ripe when the fig tree is shaken by a strong wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky was taken away like paper being rolled up. Every big hill and island was shaken out of its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>The kings of the world, the great men, the army captains, the rich people, the strong people, every slave, and every freeman hid themselves in holes and the rocks on the big hills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>They called to the hills and to the rocks and said, Fall on us! Hide us so the One on the throne will not see us. Hide us from the Lamb who is angry with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>The great day has come, and he is very angry with us. Who can stand before him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this, I saw four angels standing at four different places on the earth. They were holding back the winds coming from every way. They did this so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel coming up from the place where the sun rises. He had something to put the mark of the living God on people. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels. They had been given power to hurt the earth and the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>The angel said, Do not hurt the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have put a mark on the foreheads of Gods servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard that one hundred and forty-four thousand people were marked. They were from every tribe of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Twelve thousand people were marked from each of these tribes: Judah, Reuben, Gad,  Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this, I looked and saw many people. There were so many that no person could count them all. They were from every country, tribe, nation, and language. I saw them standing in front of the throne and the Lamb. They wore white clothes and they had palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>They called in a loud voice and said, Our God who sits on the throne, and the Lamb:  they are the Ones who save people. Salvation belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>All the angels were standing around the throne and around the leaders and the four living beings. They bowed down their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>They said, May it be so! Blessing, praise, glory and wisdom, thanks, honour, power, and strength belong to our God for ever and ever! Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the leaders talked to me. He said, Who are these people wearing white clothes? Where did they come from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>Then I said to him, Sir, I do not know. And he said to me, These are the people who have had much trouble. They have washed their clothes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>That is why they are in front of Gods throne. They worship him day and night in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will keep them safe because he is with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They will not be hungry or thirsty again. The sun or any other heat will not burn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>The Lamb who is in front of the throne will take care of them. He will guide them to the places where there is water that gives life. And God will wipe every tear from their eyes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When the Lamb opened the seventh lock, all was quiet in heaven for about a half hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels stand in front of God. Seven horns or trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel came and stood at the altar. He had a gold bowl. Plenty of incense was given to him. He was to put it with all the words of all Gods people when they talk to him. He was to put it on the gold altar in front of Gods throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The sweet smelling smoke of the burning incense went up at the same time as the prayer words of Gods people. They went up from the hand of the angel that was standing in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>Then the angel took the bowl and filled it with fire from the altar. He threw it on the earth. There was thunder, loud noises, and lightning. And the earth shook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>The seven angels who had the seven horns or trumpets got ready to blow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first angel blew his trumpet. Rain like stones, and fire mixed with blood, fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burned. A third of the trees was burned. And one third of all the green grass was burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel blew his trumpet. Then something like a big hill, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>Then a third of the sea became blood. A third of all things that lived in the sea died. A third of all the boats was broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel blew his trumpet. A big star fell from the sky. It burned and gave a bright light. It fell on a third of the rivers and places where there is water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is Bitter. A third part of the water became bitter. Many men died because the water was made bad to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was made dark. And a third of the moon and a third of the stars were made dark. A third part of them became dark. A third part of the day had no light, and also a third part of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I looked and heard an angel who was flying across the sky. He called in a loud voice and said, Trouble! Trouble! Trouble to the people who live on earth! Big trouble will come when the sound of the other trumpets is heard. The three angels are now ready to blow their trumpets!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet. I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The key to the big hole that has no bottom was given to the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>He opened the big hole and smoke came out. It was like the smoke of a very big fire. The sun and the air were made dark by the smoke from the big hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth like big grasshoppers. They were given the power to hurt people the way that scorpions do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to spoil any of the grass, nor any green plant, nor any tree on earth.  They were told to hurt only the people who did not have Gods mark on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>They were told not to kill them, but to trouble them for five months. The pain they give is like the pain a scorpion gives when it strikes a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days people will look for death, but they will not be able to find it. They will want to die, but death will fly away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The locusts looked like horses ready to go to war. On their heads were gold crowns. And they had faces like people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>Their hair was like womens hair and their teeth like lions teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>Their bodies were covered by something like pieces of iron. The noise of their wings sounded like many wagons and horses running to war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>The locusts had tails like scorpions that could strike people and hurt them for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>The king of the locusts is the angel of the big hole that has no bottom. His name is Abaddon in the Jews language and Apollyon in the Greek language. (This means, the one who destroys.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first trouble is gone. Two more troubles are coming after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Untie the four angels who are tied at the big river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels were let free. They were ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year when they would kill a third of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>In their army were many, many thousands of men on horses. I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>I saw what the horses and the men that sat on them looked like. The bodies of the men were covered by pieces of iron that looked red like fire and blue, and yellow. The heads of the horses were like lions heads. Fire, smoke and dust came out of their mouths. The dust was sulphur which choked and killed people when it burned in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three big troubles a third part of the people were killed. They were killed by the fire, smoke, and choking sulphur dust that came out of the mouths of the horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>The power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. Their tails have heads and are like snakes. They hurt people with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>The other people were not killed by these big troubles. But they did not stop worshipping what they had made with their hands. They did not stop worshipping bad spirits and idols made of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood. These idols cannot see or hear or walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not stop their killing, or their witchcraft, or their wrong ways of using sex,  or their stealing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>Then I saw another strong angel coming down from the sky. A cloud was around him and a rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like posts of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>In his hand he had a small book that was open. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>He called in a very loud voice like a lion roaring. When he called, it was like the voices of seven thunders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders had spoken, I was going to write down what they said. But I heard a voice from the sky that said, Do not tell what the seven thunders said. Do not write it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>The angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>He made a promise in the name of the one who lives for ever and ever. He made it in the name of the one who made the sky and everything in it, who made the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, There is no more time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>But when the seventh angel calls by blowing his trumpet, then the secret plan of God will be finished. It will happen just as God told his servants, the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>The voice I heard in the sky talked to me again. It said, Go to the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. Take the open book from his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. He said to me, Take it and eat it. It will be bitter inside you, but it will be sweet like honey in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>So I took the little book from the angels hand and ate it. It was sweet like honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>Then he said to me, You must tell again what God is saying to many nations, countries,  languages, and kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>Then I was given a long stick. And he said, Go and measure Gods temple and the altar,  and count the people who worship there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>Do not measure the part outside the temple. Leave it out, because it has been given to the people who do not believe in God. They will walk in the holy city for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>I will give power to the two men who speak for me. They will speak words from God.  They will continue to speak for forty-two months. They will wear clothes like people wear to show they are sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These two men are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand in front of the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>If any one wants to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies.  If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These two men can stop the sky from raining all the days that they speak words from God. And they can turn the water into blood. They can bring all kinds of trouble to the earth as often as they want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>There is a beast which is a wild animal in the big hole that has no bottom. When the two men have finished talking, the beast will come up out of the hole. It will fight with the men. It will win over them and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the big city. This city is called, Sodom and Egypt, because it is like them. Also it is where our Lord was nailed to a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>People from many nations, tribes, languages, and countries will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days. They will not let anyone bury them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>The people on earth will be very glad to see them dead. They will have a happy time.  They will give gifts to each other because these two men from God had troubled the people on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>But after the three and a half days, life came into them. They stood on their feet. And all those who saw them were very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>Then they heard a loud voice from the sky saying to them, Come up here! They went up into the sky in a cloud. And the men who hated them saw them go up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>At that time, the earth shook very much. A tenth part of the city fell down. Seven thousand people were killed by the shaking of the earth. The other people were very much afraid and they give glory to God in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second trouble is gone. The third trouble is coming soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. Loud voices were heard in the sky. They said,  The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Christ. He will rule for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>Then the twenty-four leaders who sat on their thrones in front of God kneeled down and worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>They said, We thank you, Lord God, who has all power. You live now and you always have lived. We thank you because you have now used your power and started to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The people who did not believe you became angry. But now you are angry. It is time for dead people to be judged. And it is time to reward your servants, the prophets of God,  and your holy people and all who respect your name-those who are great and those who are not so great. It is time to destroy those who destroy the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the temple of God in heaven was opened. The box where his agreement was kept was seen inside the temple. And there was lightning, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook and much rain, like stones, fell.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>I saw a wonderful thing in the sky. A woman was wearing the sun like a dress. She stood on the moon. On her head she had twelve stars in a big ring like a crown. She was going to have a baby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She cried out in pain because it was time for the baby to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another wonderful thing was seen in the sky. It was a big red dragon. He had seven heads and ten horns. He had seven big rings on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>His tail struck a third part of the stars from the sky to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who would soon have a baby. He wanted to eat her baby when it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>Then her baby boy was born. He will rule all the countries with an iron stick. Her child was taken up to God, to Gods throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>The woman ran away into the wilderness. There God had made a place ready for her.  There she will have food for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>Then there was fighting in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>But they did not win the fight and no longer were they allowed to stay in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The dragon was thrown down. He was that old snake who is called the devil and Satan.  He fools all the people in the world. He was thrown down to earth and his angels were thrown down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>I heard a loud voice in the sky. It said, Now the time has come for God to save people.  He will use his strength. His kingdom will come and his Christ will use his power. The one who says bad things about our brothers to God day and night has been thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>They have won the fight against him by the blood of the Lambs death, and by what they said. They did not try to save their lives, but were willing to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Heaven, and those who live in heaven, be glad because of it! Big trouble will come to the earth and sea! The devil has come down to you. He is very angry. He knows that he has only a short time!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to earth, he troubled the woman to whom a baby boy had been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>But the woman was given two wings like a big eagles wings. With them she could fly away from the dragon into the wilderness to her place where she would have food for three and a half periods of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>The dragon poured water like a river out of his mouth after her. He wanted the water to carry her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth helped the woman. It opened a big hole. And the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth went down the hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>Then the dragon was very angry with the woman. He went away to fight against the other children of the woman. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and tell the truth about Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then I stood on the sand by the sea. I saw a wild animal come up out of the sea. The beast had seven heads and ten horns. On its horns were ten big crowns. On its heads it had names that did not respect God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The beast I saw was like a leopard. It had feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion. The dragon gave it his own strength, his own throne, and great power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>One of its heads had a cut, bad enough to kill it. But the bad cut was healed. All the people on earth were much surprised and followed the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>They worshipped the dragon because he had given this power to the beast. And they worshipped the beast too. They said, Who is like this beast? Who can fight against it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>The beast was given a mouth that spoke proud words against God. It was given power to rule for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>It opened its mouth to speak against God, to speak against his name and the place where he lives, and to speak against those who live in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>It was also given power to fight against Gods people and to win the fight against them. It was given power to rule over every tribe, nation, language, and country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>Everyone on earth will worship the beast, if they do not have their names in the book of life. The book of life belongs to the Lamb who was killed. That was Gods plan since the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.9'>He who can hear should listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>Anyone who puts people in prison will go to prison. Any one who kills others with a long knife or sword will be killed by a long knife or sword. This is why Gods people are patient and keep on believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb but talked like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>It uses all the power of the first beast and stands with it. It makes all the earth and those who live on it worship the first beast. That was the beast whose bad cut was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>The second beast does wonderful things. It even makes fire fall from the sky to the earth for everyone to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>It fools the people who live on earth by the wonderful things which it has been given power to do, while the first beast looks on. It tells the people on earth to make an idol like the first beast that was cut by the big knife but lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>It was given power to make the idol of the beast live. The idol of the beast could speak and command all those who would not worship the idol to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>It makes all the people take a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. That means all people, those who are great and those who are not great, the poor, free men, and slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.17'>No one could buy or sell anything if he did not have this mark. This mark is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.18'>Here wisdom is needed. If a person understands, he should count the number of the beast. It is the number of a mans name. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>The song of the 144,000 Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on a hill called Zion.  With him were one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>I heard a sound from the sky like the sound of much water flowing, and like the sound of much thunder. The sound I heard was like people playing music on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>They were singing a new song in front of Gods chief chair, in front of the four living beings and the leaders. No one could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand people. They have been bought from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>They are the people who have not had sex with women. They are clean. They are the people who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They lived among people on earth. They have been bought from the earth. They are the first among men to have been bought for God and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.5'>They never told lies. They are found to be without any wrong ways as they stand before the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.6'>Then I saw another angel flying across the sky. He had good news that will last for ever to tell the people who live on the earth. The good news is for every country, tribe,  language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.7'>He said in a loud voice, Respect and honour God and give him glory! The time has come for him to judge people, to tell them how good or bad they are. Worship him. He made heaven and earth, the sea, and the rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.8'>A second angel followed him. He said, The great city of Babylon has fallen down. It has fallen down because it filled all the countries with its wrong ways. It has made people to suffer Gods anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.10'>A third angel followed the other two. He said in a loud voice, Any person who worships the beast or its idol, and takes its mark on his forehead or on his hand, will also feel Gods anger. He is very angry. That person will be burned with fire and dust that chokes people when it burns. He will be burned in front of the holy angels and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.11'>The smoke of that fire goes up for ever and ever. Those who worship the animal and its idol, and anyone who takes the mark of its name, will get no rest day or night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.12'>This is why Gods people must be patient. They are the ones who keep the laws of God and believe in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.13'>I heard a voice from the sky. It said, Write this: From now on, happy are those who die believing in the Lord. Yes, says the Spirit. They will have rest from their troubles. The good things they have done will go with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.14'>I looked and saw a white cloud. I saw someone like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud.  He had a big gold crown on his head and a sharp harvest knife in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.15'>Another angel came out of Gods temple. He called in a loud voice to the one who was sitting on the cloud. He said, Take your knife and cut the harvest. The time has come to take in the harvest because the earth is ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.16'>So the one who sat on the cloud used his knife on earth. And the harvest on earth was cut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.17'>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He also had a sharp knife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.18'>And another angel came from the altar. He had power over fire. He called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp knife. He said, Take your sharp knife and gather the fruit that grows on the vine on the earth. Its fruit is ripe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.19'>So the angel used his knife on earth. He gathered the fruit of the vine on the earth. He put it in the big place where the water of the fruit is pressed out. This place is Gods anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.20'>It was outside the city that they pressed the fruit. Blood ran out of the place. It came up as high as the horses heads for about two hundred miles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.1'>I saw another big and wonderful thing in the sky. I saw seven angels who carried the seven big troubles. They are the last troubles. When these troubles have come, Gods anger is ended. 2I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. And I saw those people who had won the fight against the beast, and its idol, and its mark, and the number of its name. They were standing on the sea of glass and they had the harps of God in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>They sing the song of Moses who is the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. They say, Lord God who has all power, the things you do are great and wonderful! King for ever, your ways are right and true!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>Who will not respect and honour you and praise your name, Lord? You are the only one who is holy. People from all countries will come and worship you because they have seen that you are right and fair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.4'>After this I looked. The temple in heaven was open. It was the place where Gods agreement was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.5'>The seven angels who carried the seven troubles came out of the temple. They were wearing linen clothes, clean and shining. Around their chests they wore gold belts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.6'>One of the four living beings gave the angels seven gold bowls. The bowls were full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.7'>The temple was full of smoke because God is so great and has so much power. No one could go into the temple until the seven troubles, which the seven angels had, were ended.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>I heard a loud voice coming from the temple. It said to the seven angels, Go and pour the seven bowls of Gods anger on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. Then a bad, dirty sore came on the people who had the mark of the animal on them, and who worshipped its idol.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured his bowl on the sea. It turned into blood like that of a person who has been killed. Everything in the sea that had life died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third angel poured his bowl on the rivers and the places where there was water.  They turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the water say, Holy One, you who live now and who always have lived, and will live for ever; you are right because you have punished them this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>They killed Gods people and the prophets. Now you have given them blood to drink. This is what they should get!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>I heard the people under the altar say, Yes, Lord God, you have all power! The way you punish is true and right!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. Then the sun was given the power to burn people with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>People were burned because the sun was so hot. And they spoke wrongly about the name of God, cursing him because he had the power to send these troubles. But they would not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not respect and honour God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. The place where he ruled became dark. People bit their tongues because of the pain they had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>They cursed God in heaven because of their pain and sores. But they did not stop the wrong things they were doing. They would not turn back to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth angel poured his bowl on the big river Euphrates. Its water dried up so that a road was made ready for the kings to come from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>I saw three bad spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the prophet who is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>They are the spirits of gods who are not true, and they do wonderful things. They go to the kings of the whole world and gather them to fight on the great day of God who has all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>Look! I will come like a thief. The person who stays awake and dressed will be glad he did! He will not be without clothes and he will not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>They gathered at the place called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the temple and the chair. It said, It is finished!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>There were lightnings, loud noises, and thunder. The earth shook very much. It shook more than it had ever shaken since people have been on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>The big city was broken into three parts. And the cities of the nations fell down. God remembered Babylon, the big city. He made it feel all of his great anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>The islands all went away, and the mountains could not be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>Rain like big stones fell from the sky on men. Each stone weighed about a hundred pounds. Men cursed God because the big rain of stones fell on them. The trouble was very bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>One of the seven angels who had carried the seven bowls came and talked to me. He said, Come, and I will show you the woman who has given herself over to wrong ways of using sex. She is sitting over many waters. I will show you how she will be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>The kings on earth have been with her and copied her. And the people on earth gladly copy her wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>Then the angel took me away in the Spirit to a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names against God written all over it. It had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>The woman was wearing blue and red clothes. She was shining with gold, fine stones,  and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup. It was full of the wrong things she did and of her dirty ways of using sex.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>A name was written on her forehead. It has a secret meaning. The name is Great Babylon, the mother of all people who give their bodies for wrong ways of using sex. The mother of all things done on earth too bad to talk about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman was drunk because of the blood she drank. It was the blood of Gods people, and the blood of people who had been killed because they belonged to Jesus. When I saw her, I was very much surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>The angel asked me, Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and the beast with seven heads and horns that carries her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that you saw was alive at one time, then it was dead. It will come up from the big hole that has no bottom and it will be killed. The people on earth will be surprised when they see the beast, because it was alive and then it was dead, and it comes alive again. These are the people who do not have their names written in the book of life from the time the world was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>To understand this, one must be wise. The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman is sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>They are also seven kings. Five have already lost their power. One is ruling now, and the other one has not yet come. When he comes he will rule for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>The beast that was alive at the one time, and then was dead, is the eighth king. He is really one of the seven. He will be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet ruled. They will have power for one hour to rule with the animal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These ten all think the same way, and they give to the beast their power and right to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>They will fight against the Lamb, but the Lamb will win the fight against them. He will win because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are with the Lamb will also win. God has called them and chosen them, and they believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>And the angel said to me, You saw the water on which the bad woman is sitting. The water is the many nations, many people, many countries, and many languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>You saw the ten horns and the animal. They will hate the bad woman. They will take away everything she has and her fine clothes. They will eat her body and burn her up in a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>God has put it into their hearts to do what he wants done to her. They will all agree. They will give to the beast their power to rule until what God has said comes true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>The woman whom you saw is the big city that rules over the kings on earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After that I saw another angel coming down from the sky. He had much power. The bright light that shone from him lit up the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>He called in a loud voice and said, The big city of Babylon has fallen down! It has fallen down! Bad spirits live in it. All bad spirits hide there. And all kinds of dirty birds that people hate hide there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>All the nations are broken down because they are full of its wrong ways. The kings of the earth have joined with it. The traders of the earth have become rich because of its wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>Then I heard another voice from the sky that said, Come out of it, my people, so that you will have no part in the wrong things it does. Come out of it so that you will not have the big troubles it will have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>Its wrong ways are piled as high as the sky and God has remembered the wrong things it has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Do to it what it did to you. Yes, do two times as much to it as it did to you! From the cup it gave you to drink, give it two times as much to drink as it gave to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>It is proud of itself and has done wrong things. Give it that much trouble and crying. It says in its heart, "I am like a queen. I am not like a woman who has lost her husband. I will never know sorrow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>So then, its big troubles will come in one day. Those troubles are death, crying, hunger,  and being burned in a fire. The Lord who has punished it is strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>And the kings of the earth were joined with it in its wrong ways. They will cry and be sad about it when they see the smoke while it burns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will say, "Trouble! Trouble! You big, strong city Babylon! In one hour your punishment has come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the traders of the earth will cry and be sad about it, because no one buys the things they bring to sell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>They have many things to sell: gold, silver, fine stones, and pearls. They have linen clothes and blue cloth, silk cloth and red cloth. They have all kinds of sweet smelling wood. They have all kinds of things made of ivory. They have all kinds of things made of wood that costs much money, of brass, of iron, and of a stone called marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>They have spices and perfume. They have incense and a sweet-smelling oil. They have frankincense and wine and oil. They have fine flour and wheat. They have cows, sheep,  horses, and wagons. They have slaves and people to sell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>The things that your heart wanted are gone from you. All your fine food and clothes are gone from you. You will never find them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The traders will sell these things and got much money from the city. They will stand far away from it because they are afraid of the trouble it is having. They will cry and be sad about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>They will say "How terrible for you, you big strong city! You were wearing linen clothes and purple and red clothes. You were shining with gold, fine stones, and pearls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>In one hour all your great riches are lost." And all the captains of the boats and all the seamen, the sailors, and all that do business on the sea stood away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>They called out loud when they saw the smoke while it burned. They said, "What city is like that big city?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>They threw dust on their heads and they called out loud. They cried and were sad. They said, "How terrible for that big city! All the men who had boats on the sea became rich because it was rich. In one hour it is all lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Be glad for what has happened to it, all you who are in heaven, Gods people, apostles and prophets. God has punished it for what it did to you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a strong angel took up a very heavy stone and threw it into the sea. He said, So hard will Babylon the big city be thrown down. It will not be seen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>People will not hear music in you again. No harps, no singing, no pipes or horns will ever be heard in you again. No one will make things in you again. The noise of people grinding grain will not be heard in you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>No lamp will shine in you again. No one will hear the voice of people being married.  Your traders were the big people of the world. All the countries were fooled by your witch doctors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>The blood of prophets and of Gods people and of all who have been killed on earth was found in that city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After this I heard a loud sound in heaven. It sounded like many people calling. They said,  Praise our God! He saves people. He is great and power belongs to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>The way God punishes is true and right. He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways. He has made her pay for the killing of his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>They said again, Praise God! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down. They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne, and they said, Amen! Yes, it is so! Praise God!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>She was given the right to wear fine linen, shining and clean. The fine linen means the good things Gods people have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>The angel said to me, Write this: God blesses those who are called to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>Then I kneeled down in front of him to worship him. But he said to me, You must not do that! I am only a servant like you and like your brothers who tell about Jesus. Worship God! Those who tell about Jesus have the spirit of a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw heaven open, and I saw a white horse! The One who rode him is called One who can be Trusted and The True One.He punishes and makes war in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes were like a flame of fire. On his head were many crowns. He had a name written on him, but no man knew what it was but he himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>He wore clothes that had been dipped in blood. His name is The Word of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>A long knife or sword comes from his mouth. With it he will punish and control the people of the nations. He will rule them with an iron stick.

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>The wall of the city was made of a very fine stone called jasper. The city was all made of pure gold. It was clear like glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The bottom of the city wall was covered with all kinds of fine stones. The first stone was red jasper. The second stone was blue sapphire. The third stone was of many colours called agate. The fourth stone was green emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>The fifth stone was onyx. The sixth stone was red carnelian. The seventh stone was green crysolite. The eighth stone was green beryl. The ninth stone was yellow topaz. The tenth stone was green chrysoprase. The eleventh stone was red jacinth. And the twelfth stone was a blue amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>The twelve doors were twelve pearls. Each door was made from one big pearl. The street of the city was all pure gold. It was as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>I did not see any temple in the city. The Lord God, who has all power, and the Lamb, are its temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>The city does not need the sun or the moon to give light in it. The glory of God gives light,  and the Lamb is its lamp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>Those who are saved will walk in its light. The kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>The doors of the city will never be shut in the day time, and there will be no night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>The glory and the honour of all nations will be brought into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>Nothing that is not holy will ever go in. People who do wrong things and tell lies will never go in. Only those whose names are written in the Lambs book of life will go in.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>Then the angel showed me a river of the water which gives life. It was as clear as glass. It flows from the throne of God and the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>It flows through the middle of the street of the city. On each side of the river is the tree which gives life. It has twelve kinds of fruit, and it bears its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree could heal the people of all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>Nothing that God hates will be in the city any more. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there. And his servants will serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>There will be no night there. They do not need the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun.  The Lord God will give them light. They will rule for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>Then the angel said to me, These words can be trusted. They are true. The Lord God who gave his Spirit to the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Look! I will come soon! God will bless the person who obeys the words in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>I, John, heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them I kneeled down to worship in front of the angel who showed them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>But He said to me, You must not do that. I am only a servant like you and your brothers,  the prophets, and those who obey the words of this book. Worship God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>The angel said to me, Do not keep secret the words of Gods message in this book. The time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>Let the bad man keep on doing wrong things. Let the person who does dirty things, keep on being dirty. Let the good person keep on doing what is good. Let the holy person keep on being holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>Look, I will come soon! When I come, I will pay every man for what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the First and the Last. I am the Beginning and the End.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>God will bless the people who do what he says and keep themselves pure and clean.  They can eat fruit from the tree that gives life. And they can go through the doors into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside the city are the dirty people, and the witch-doctors, and those with wrong ways of using sex, those who kill people, those who worship idols, and all those who like lies and tell them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to tell these things to you in the churches. I am the root and the branch of David. I am the bright star in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>The Spirit and the Lambs wife say, Come. He who hears should say, Come. He who is thirsty should come. Anyone who wishes should drink the water that gives life. It costs no money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>I am talking to everyone who hears the words of Gods message in this book. If any one adds anything to this book, God will add to him the troubles that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>If any one takes away any of the words of Gods message, God will take away from him his share of the tree which gives life and the holy city. This book tells about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who shows these things says, Yes, I will come soon. Amen, Lord Jesus, come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>May the love and mercy of the Lord Jesus bless you all. Amen.</verse>
