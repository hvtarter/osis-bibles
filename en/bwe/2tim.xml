        <description>The Bible in Worldwide English (BWE)\par This New Testament was originally prepared by Annie Cressman, who died in 1993. She was a Canadian Bible teacher in Liberia in West Africa. Whilst teaching students in a Bible School where the language used was English, she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself. So she decided to write this simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\par\par In 1959 the Full Gospel Publishing House in Toronto, Canada, printed a trial edition of the Gospel of Mark. A further edition was published in 1962 by the American Bible Society. The whole New Testament was first published by SOON Publications in India in 1969 in hardback form. This was assisted by Operation Mobilisation (OM) and was reprinted in 1971.\par\par The vision to reprint a new edition of the whole New Testament has now been carried out by SOON in conjunction with EPH and OM. Where a change to more modern words has been made, this has been kept in line with the the Authorised Version.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='2Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.1'>I am Paul. I am an apostle of Christ Jesus because God wanted me to be. This is because God has promised life through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.2'>Timothy, you are my son and I love you very much. May God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord, bless you. May they be kind to you and give you peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.3'>I worship God with a clean heart, as my fathers did. And I thank God when I talk to him about you. I always do this night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.4'>I want very much to see you. I remember how you cried when we left you. When I see you, how happy I shall be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.5'>I remember that you really believe. Your grandmother Lois believed first. Your mother Eunice believed too. I am sure that you believe in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>That is why I am telling you again. You must use Gods gift. It was given to you when I put my hands on your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>God has not given us a spirit of fear. But he has given us a spirit of power and love and self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>So do not be ashamed to talk about our Lord. And do not be ashamed of me. I am his prisoner. Be patient in your trouble also, because you tell the good news. God will give you the power to do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did not do it because of the good things we have done. He did it because he himself planned to do it, and wanted to do it. That was the blessing he gave us in Christ Jesus. He had this plan before he made the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>But now he has made it real through the coming of Jesus Christ who saves. He has put death out of the way. He has shown people can have everlasting life by telling them the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>I have been chosen to tell that good news. I have been chosen to go out and teach it to those who are not Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>That is why I have this trouble. But I am not ashamed of it because I know the one whom I have trusted. And I am sure he is able to keep safe what I have trusted to him. He will keep it safe until that great day when he comes again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>Take what I have taught you as a guide for good teaching. Keep believing in Christ Jesus and loving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.14'>Keep safe that good thing which was trusted to you. The Holy Spirit who lives in us will help you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.15'>You know that all the men who live in the country of Asia Minor have left me. Phygellus and Hermogenes are among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.16'>I hope the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus. He has often helped me. He has not been ashamed of me in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.17'>When he came to the city of Rome, he looked for me until he found me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.18'>I hope the Lord will be kind to him on that great day. You know very well all that he did for me in the city of Ephesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.1'>So, my son Timothy, be strong. Christ Jesus has blessed you so that you can be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.2'>You and many others heard what I taught. Now you must teach these things to men who can be trusted, men who will be able to teach them to other people also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.3'>Be patient in your trouble like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.4'>A soldier who is fighting does not live the way other people do. He wants to please the one who chose him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.5'>A man runs a race. But he does not win if he does not obey the rules.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.6'>A farmer works hard planting. He should be the first one to have the food that grows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Think about what I say and the Lord will help you understand everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Keep your mind on Jesus Christ. He was raised from death. He was of the family of David. That is the good news I tell people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>Because of that, I have trouble. I am even tied with chains like a bad man. But the word of God is not tied up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.10'>That is why I bear all my trouble for the sake of Gods chosen people. I do it so that they also may be saved by Christ Jesus and be made great for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.11'>These are true words: If we died with Christ, we shall also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.12'>If we bear all our troubles, we shall also rule with him. If we say we do not know him,  then he will also say he does not know us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>If we do not believe in him, he still is true, because he cannot say he is not what he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>Tell people these things again. Tell them before the Lord not to quarrel in their teaching.  There is no good in doing that. It upsets the minds of those who listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.15'>Try to show God that you are a good worker. Do nothing you would be ashamed of. Tell the true message in the right way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.16'>Have no part in foolish talk that does not come from God. That kind of talk will take people farther and farther away from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>Their teaching will spread like bad sickness. Hymenaeus and Philetus are two like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>These men say that the time when people are raised from death is past already. That is not true. And what they say is making some people stop believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>But the truth of God stands strong. It cannot change. These words are sure: The Lord knows the people who belong to him and, Let all those who use the name of the Lord stop their wrong ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>In a large house there are many pots. They are not all made of gold and silver. Some are made of wood, and some of earth. Some are used for fine things and some are used for things that are not so fine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>So if a person keeps himself clean from these things, he will be like a dish that is used for a fine work. It is kept as a better dish for the head man of the house, and it is ready for any good thing he wants to use it for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>Have no part at all in the wrong things that young men like to do. Believe. Have love.  Follow what is right. Live at peace. Do these things along with others who have a clean heart and talk to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>Keep out of foolish quarrels. You know that they start fights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>The Lords servant must not fight. But he must be kind to all people. He must be a good teacher to them. He must be patient with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>When he corrects those who are against him, he must do it in a gentle way. It may be that God will turn their hearts to know what is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>And they may get free again from the devils trap. He has caught them to do what he wants them to do.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.1'>Be sure of this. In the last days hard times will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.2'>People will love themselves. They will love money. They will talk about themselves and be proud. They will say wrong things about people. They will not obey their parents.  They will not be thankful. They will not keep anything holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.3'>They will have no love. They will not agree with anybody. They will tell lies about people. They will have no self-control. They will beat people. They will not love anything that is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.4'>They cannot be trusted. They will act quickly, without thinking. They are proud of themselves. They love to have fun more than they love God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.5'>They act as if they worshipped God, yet they do not let Gods power work in their lives.  Keep away from people like that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.6'>They are the kind who go quietly into peoples houses. There they get foolish women to believe them. These women know that they have done many wrong things. And they want to do many kinds of wrong things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.7'>They are always trying to learn, but never able to find out what is really true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Jannes and Jambres were two men who were very much against Moses. In the same way, these men I am talking about are against what is true. They are men who have wrong thoughts in their minds. They do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.9'>But these men will not get very far. Everyone will see that they are wrong, just as people saw that Jannes and Jambres were wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.10'>Timothy, you know my teaching and the way I lived. You know what I want to do and what I believe. You know my patience, my love, and my strength to bear trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.11'>You know about my troubles. You know what happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium,  and in Lystra. You know how badly the people treated me. But the Lord brought me safely through it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.12'>Yes, all who want to live a good life in Christ Jesus will be troubled by other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.13'>Bad men and those who fool other people will grow worse and worse. They will fool other people, and other people will fool them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.14'>But you, Timothy, must keep on doing the things you have learned. You know they are right. You know who taught them to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.15'>From the time you were a child you knew the holy writings. They showed you how to be saved by believing in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.16'>All that is written in the holy writings comes from the Spirit of God. The holy writings are good for these things: to teach people, to show them when they are wrong, to make them see what is right, to teach them to do what is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.17'>In this way a person who belongs to God has all he needs. He is ready for every kind of good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I say this before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge people who are living and people who are dead. I say this to you because he will come back and rule over all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>Tell people the word of God. Be ready to do it at any time. Show people they are wrong and talk to them about it. Tell them what they should do. Be very patient with them and teach them in many ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>The time is coming when people will not listen to good teaching. They will want to listen to the things they like to hear. And they will bring in many teachers who will teach them just what they want to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>They will not listen to what is true, but will turn away and listen to strange stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But you, Timothy, must always be watching. Be patient in your troubles. Tell the good news. Do all the work God has given you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>My life is already being poured out as an offering to God. The time is here for me to leave this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have fought the kind of fight that is good. I have reached the mark on the road that God wanted me to reach. And I have kept on believing in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>From now on, my reward is waiting for me, because I have done what is right. The Lord will repay me on the day when he comes back. He judges the right way. I will not be the only one to get a reward from him. But he will repay all those who want very much to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Try to come to me soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>Demas has left me because he loved the things of this world. He has gone to the city of Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. He helps me very much in my work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>I left a coat with Carpus in Troas. Bring it with you when you come, and also bring the books. But most of all, I want the written papers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander, the man who makes things from copper, did many wrong things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>You too must keep away from him, for he was very much against what we said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>The first time I spoke for myself in court, no one was on my side. All left me. I hope that God will forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>But the Lord was with me. He gave me strength to tell the message. All those who are not Jews heard it. And I was saved out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>The Lord will save me from every wrong thing. He will bring me safely into the kingdom of heaven. Praise him for ever and ever. Yes, he will!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the people who belong to the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth. Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Try to come before the cold time of the year. Eubulus sends you greetings. So do Pudens, Linus, and Claudia and all the Christian brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord be with your spirit. May he in his kindness bless you. Amen. May it be so!</verse>
