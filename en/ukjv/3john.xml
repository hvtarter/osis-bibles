      <chapter osisID='3John.1'>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The elder unto the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatsoever you do to the brethren, and to strangers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>Which have borne witness of your love (o. agape) before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow-helpers to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, babbling against us with malicious words: (o. logos) and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and all of you know that our record is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
