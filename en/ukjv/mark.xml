  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare all of you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit (o. pneuma) like a dove descending upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the spirit (o. pneuma) drives him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent all of you, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said unto them, Come all of you after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they forsook their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; (o. pneuma) and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And when the unclean spirit (o. pneuma) had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commands he even the unclean spirits, (o. pneuma) and they do obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and soon they tell him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and says unto him, I will; be you clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And says unto him, See you say nothing to any man: but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, (o. logos) insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word (o. logos) unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, your sins be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit (o. pneuma) that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason all of you these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that all of you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he says to the sick of the palsy,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say unto you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into yours house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at food in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, he says unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be ruined: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said unto them, Have all of you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he says unto the man, Stretch forth yours hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should crowd upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him in order to touch him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And unclean spirits, (o. pneuma) when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up into a mountain, and calls unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And Simon he surnamed Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casts he out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith whatsoever they shall blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit (o. pneuma) has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they said, He has an unclean spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, your mother and your brethren without seek for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said unto them, Know all of you not this parable? and how then will all of you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word. (o. logos)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are they by the way side, where the word (o. logos) is sown; but when they have heard, Satan comes immediately, and takes away the word (o. logos) that was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, (o. logos) immediately receive it with gladness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution arises for the word's sake, (o. logos) immediately they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, (o. logos)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, (o. logos) and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, (o. logos) and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said unto them, Take heed what all of you hear: with what measure all of you mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For he that has, to him shall be given: and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth brings forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, Unto which shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such parables spoke he the word (o. logos) unto them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>But without a parable spoke he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And the same day, when the even was come, he says unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, care you not that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said unto them, Why are all of you so fearful? how is it that all of you have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jesus far off, he ran and worshipped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits (o. pneuma) went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And, behold, there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said unto her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Master any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>As soon as Jesus heard the word (o. logos) that was spoken, he says unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he takes the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and enters in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto you, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no pouch, no bread, no money in their purse:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they were come out of the ship, immediately they knew him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And anywhere he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and dug a place for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do all of you not therefore go astray, because all of you know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And as concerning the dead, that they rise: have all of you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength: this is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second is like, namely this, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is no other but he:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make yours enemies your footstool.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And Jesus sat opposite to the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And he called unto him his disciples, and says unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow has cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But neither so did their witness agree together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, I am: and all of you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and says, What need we any further witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>All of you have heard the blasphemy: what think all of you? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And you also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what you says. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them: for you are a Galilaean, and your speech agrees thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom all of you speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word (o. rhema) that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, you shall deny me three times. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, You says it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will all of you that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will all of you then that I shall do unto him whom all of you call the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed him with purple, and intertwined a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they stroke him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroys the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>Save yourself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion, which stood opposite to him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the spirit, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women looking on far off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a tomb which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the tomb at the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he says unto them, Be not affrighted: All of you seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he has risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall all of you see him, as he said unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out quickly, and fled from the tomb; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at food, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said unto them, Go all of you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word (o. logos) with signs following. Amen.</verse>
