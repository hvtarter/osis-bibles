  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>But has in due times manifested his word (o. logos) through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not an attacker, not given to filthy illegal gain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>Holding fast the faithful word (o. logos) as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy illegal gain's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, sluggards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love, (o. agape) in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word (o. logos) of God be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing incorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>Sound speech, (o. logos) that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>Not embezzling, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself an exclusive people, zealous of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit; (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This is a faithful saying, (o. logos) and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are useless and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be lacking unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All that are with me salute you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
