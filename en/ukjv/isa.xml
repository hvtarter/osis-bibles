      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should all of you be stricken any more? all of you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and rotting sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, all of you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, all of you people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When all of you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when all of you spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when all of you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If all of you be willing and obedient, all of you shall eat the good of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if all of you refuse and rebel, all of you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore says the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand upon you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which all of you have desired, and all of you shall be confounded for the gardens that all of you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For all of you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many people shall go and say, Come all of you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come all of you, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself: therefore forgive them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide you in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake terribly the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the rugged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake terribly the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease all of you from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, does take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, You have clothing, be you our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The show of their countenance does witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say all of you to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead you cause you to go astray, and destroy the way of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD stands up to plead, and stands to judge the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for all of you have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What mean all of you that all of you beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover the LORD says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and moving enticingly as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>Therefore the LORD will strike with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>The chains, and the bracelets, and the covering for the lower part of the face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>The rings, and nose jewels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Now will I sing to my beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the best vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor dug; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Truthfully many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp, and the viol, the timbrel, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore hell has enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoices, shall descend into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an explicit sign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and yours iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear all of you indeed, but understand not; and see all of you indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.46.2'>They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.3'>Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.4'>And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.5'>To whom will all of you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.6'>They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.7'>They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he stands; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.8'>Remember this, and show yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O all of you transgressors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.9'>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.10'>Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.11'>Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.12'>Hearken unto me, all of you stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.46.13'>I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.47.1'>Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.2'>Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover your locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.3'>Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet you as a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.47.5'>Sit you silent, and get you into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.6'>I was angry with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into yours hand: you did show them no mercy; upon the ancient have you very heavily laid your yoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.7'>And you said, I shall be a lady for ever: so that you did not lay these things to your heart, neither did remember the latter end of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.8'>Therefore hear now this, you that are given to pleasures, that dwell carelessly, that says in yours heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.9'>But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon you in their perfection for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great abundance of yours enchantments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.10'>For you have trusted in your wickedness: you have said, None sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you; and you have said in yours heart, I am, and none else beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.11'>Therefore shall evil come upon you; you shall not know from whence it rises: and mischief shall fall upon you; you shall not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon you suddenly, which you shall not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.12'>Stand now with yours enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, wherein you have laboured from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.13'>You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly sign tellers, stand up, and save you from these things that shall come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.14'>Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.47.15'>Thus shall they be unto you with whom you have laboured, even your merchants, from your youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.48.1'>Hear all of you this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.2'>For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.3'>I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.4'>Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.5'>I have even from the beginning declared it to you; before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, Mine idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.6'>You have heard, see all this; and will not all of you declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.7'>They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.8'>Yea, you heard not; yea, you knew not; yea, from that time that yours ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.9'>For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.10'>Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.11'>For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.12'>Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.13'>Mine hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.14'>All you, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.15'>I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.16'>Come all of you near unto me, hear all of you this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.17'>Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.18'>O that you had hearkened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.19'>Your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.20'>Go all of you out of Babylon, flee all of you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare all of you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say all of you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.21'>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.22'>There is no peace, says the LORD, unto the wicked.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.49.1'>Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, all of you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.2'>And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.3'>And said unto me, You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.4'>Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.5'>And now, says the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.6'>And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.7'>Thus says the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation detests, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.8'>Thus says the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.9'>That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.10'>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.11'>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.12'>Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.13'>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.14'>But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.15'>Can a woman forget her nursing infant, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.49.17'>Your children shall make haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go out of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.18'>Lift up yours eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says the LORD, you shall surely clothe you with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.19'>For your waste and your desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be far away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.20'>The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in yours ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.21'>Then shall you say in yours heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing back and forth? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.49.22'>Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.50.1'>Thus says the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have all of you sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.50.2'>Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinks, because there is no water, and dies for thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.50.3'>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.50.4'>The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens mine ear to hear as the learned.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.61.2'>To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.3'>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.4'>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.5'>And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the foreigner shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.6'>But all of you shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: all of you shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall all of you boast yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.7'>For your shame all of you shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.8'>For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.9'>And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD has blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.10'>I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.61.11'>For as the earth brings forth her bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.62'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.1'>For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.2'>And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.3'>You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.4'>You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.5'>For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you: and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.6'>I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: all of you that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.7'>And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.8'>The LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your corn to be food for yours enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink your wine, for the which you have laboured:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.9'>But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.10'>Go through, go through the gates; prepare all of you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.11'>Behold, the LORD has proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say all of you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.12'>And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.63'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.1'>Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.2'>Wherefore are you red in yours apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winepress?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.3'>I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.4'>For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.5'>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.6'>And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.7'>I will mention the loving kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.8'>For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.9'>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.10'>But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.11'>Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.12'>That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.13'>That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'>As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so did you lead your people, to make yourself a glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory: where is your zeal and your strength, the sounding of your bowels and of your mercies toward me? are they restrained?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.16'>Doubtless you are our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: you, O LORD, are our father, our redeemer; your name is from everlasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'>O LORD, why have you made us to go astray from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of yours inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'>The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'>We are yours: you never bare rule over them; they were not called by your name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.64'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>As when the melting fire burns, the fire causes the waters to boil, to make your name known to yours adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When you did terrible things which we looked not for, you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you are angry; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'>And there is none that calls upon your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you: for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'>But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'>Be not angry very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we plead to you, we are all your people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'>Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.12'>Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>A people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>Which say, Stand by yourself, come not near to me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>But all of you are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and all of you shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, all of you did not answer; when I spoke, all of you did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but all of you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but all of you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but all of you shall be ashamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but all of you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>And all of you shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay you, and call his servants by another name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>But be all of you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus says the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that all of you build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For all those things has mine hand made, and all those things have been, says the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of the LORD, all of you that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompence to his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? says your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice all of you with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>That all of you may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that all of you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall all of you suck, all of you shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and all of you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And when all of you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles far off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</verse>
