      <chapter osisID='Eph.1'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: (o. agape)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In whom all of you also trusted, after that all of you heard the word (o. logos) of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that all of you believed, all of you were sealed with that holy Spirit (o. pneuma) of promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>Which is the earn of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love (o. agape) unto all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit (o. pneuma) of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that all of you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>Wherein in time past all of you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit (o. pneuma) that now works in the children of disobedience:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love (o. agape) wherewith he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace all of you are saved;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace are all of you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>Not of works, lest any man should boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Wherefore remember, that all of you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>That at that time all of you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus all of you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; in order to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And came and preached peace to you which were far off, and to them that were nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him we both have access by one Spirit (o. pneuma) unto the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Now therefore all of you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>In whom all of you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>If all of you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>Whereby, when all of you read, all of you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>That the Gentiles should be join heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>Wherefore I desire that all of you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit (o. pneuma) in the inner man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that all of you, being rooted and grounded in love, (o. agape)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>And to know the love (o. agape) of Christ, which passes knowledge, that all of you might be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, plead to you that all of you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith all of you are called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; (o. agape)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit (o. pneuma) in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body, and one Spirit, (o. pneuma) even as all of you are called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Wherefore he says, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>That we henceforth be no more children, tossed back and forth, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>But speaking the truth in love, (o. agape) may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. (o. agape)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that all of you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But all of you have not so learned Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>If so be that all of you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>That all of you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>And be renewed in the spirit (o. pneuma) of your mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>And that all of you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be all of you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>Neither give place to the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no corrupt communication (o. logos) proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And grieve not the holy Spirit (o. pneuma) of God, whereby all of you are sealed unto the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>And be all of you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be all of you therefore followers of God, as dear children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>And walk in love, (o. agape) as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For this all of you know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no man deceive you with vain words: (o. logos) for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Be not all of you therefore partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For all of you were sometimes darkness, but now are all of you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>(For the fruit of the Spirit (o. pneuma) is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Wherefore he says, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that all of you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Wherefore be all of you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, (o. rhema)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honour your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>That it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And, all of you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And, all of you masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the whole armour of God, that all of you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that all of you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</verse>
