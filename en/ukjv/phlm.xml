      <chapter osisID='Phlm.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow labourer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>Hearing of your love (o. agape) and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, (o. agape) because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to admonish you that which is convenient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>Yet for love's (o. agape) sake I rather plead to you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I plead to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>Which in time past was to you useless, but now profitable to you and to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>Whom I would have retained with me, that in your position he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on mine account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: although it be I do not say to you how you owe unto me even yours own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>But likewise prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>There salute you Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow labourers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. (o. pneuma) Amen.</verse>
