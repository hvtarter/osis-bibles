      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her adversary also provoked her sore, in order to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of yours handmaid, and remember me, and not forget yours handmaid, but will give unto yours handmaid a male child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said unto her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not yours handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let yours handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seems you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, Nay; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said unto them, Why do all of you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: all of you make the LORD's people to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall implore for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Wherefore kick all of you at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honour your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Wherefore the LORD God of Israel says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD says, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off yours arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man in yours house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in yours house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume yours eyes, and to grieve yours heart: and all the increase of yours house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be a sign unto you, that shall come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in yours house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, LORD; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for your servant hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said unto you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seems him good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore has the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing in time past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that stroke the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O all of you Philistines, that all of you be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for you have born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and stroke them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.9'>And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he stroke the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.4'>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.5'>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.7'>And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall all of you say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, Tomorrow, by that time the sun be hot, all of you shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and all of you shall do with us all that seems good unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And it was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: in order to day the LORD has wrought salvation in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan stroke the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom upon Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be captain over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leads to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>Now it came to pass on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The forefront of the one was situated northward opposite to Michmash, and the other southward opposite to Gibeah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armour bearer said unto him, Do all that is in yours heart: turn you; behold, I am with you according to your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armour bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour bearer slew after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armour bearer were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much more, if lest by any means the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>And they stroke the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, All of you have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seems good unto you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>And Saul said, Draw all of you near here, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin has been this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For, as the LORD lives, which saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then said he unto all Israel, Be all of you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seems good unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and anywhere he turned himself, he vexed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>And he gathered an host, and stroke the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.17'>And Samuel said, When you were little in yours own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.18'>And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.19'>Wherefore then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly upon the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.20'>And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.21'>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.22'>And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.25'>Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbour of yours, that is better than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.29'>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.30'>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.31'>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.32'>Then said Samuel, Bring all of you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.33'>And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.34'>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.35'>And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.1'>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill yours horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.7'>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.8'>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.13'>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.14'>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.1'>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.2'>But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will commune with my father of you; and what I see, that I will tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been toward you very good:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice: wherefore then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD lives, he shall not be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he stroke the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, tomorrow you shall be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>And Saul said unto Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said unto him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>And David swore moreover, and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in yours eyes; and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at food: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If your father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he be very angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would not I tell it you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answer you roughly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about tomorrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto you, and show it you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And as concerning the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And it came to pass on the next day, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore comes not the son of Jesse to food, neither yesterday, nor to day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in yours eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to yours own confusion, and unto the confusion of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what has he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me a business, and has said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabouts I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now therefore what is under yours hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Truthfully women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under yours hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scratch on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, all of you see the man is mad: wherefore then have all of you brought him to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>Have I need of mad men, that all of you have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, all of you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.8'>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.9'>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.10'>And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.11'>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.12'>And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>And Saul said unto him, Why have all of you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goes at your bidding, and is honourable in yours house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.16'>And the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.17'>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.18'>And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.19'>And Nob, the city of the priests, stroke he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.20'>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.21'>And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.22'>And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.23'>Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be in safeguard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.1'>Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.2'>Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.3'>And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.4'>Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into yours hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and stroke them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.6'>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.7'>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.8'>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.9'>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.10'>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.11'>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I plead to you, tell your servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.12'>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver you up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went anywhere they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he ceased to go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.16'>And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.17'>And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto you; and that also Saul my father knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.18'>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.19'>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.20'>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.21'>And Saul said, Blessed be all of you of the LORD; for all of you have compassion on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.22'>Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very subtlely.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.24'>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto you, Behold, I will deliver yours enemy into yours hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good unto you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart stroke him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was rude and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>And thus shall all of you say to him that lives in prosperity, Peace be both to you, and peace be to yours house, and peace be unto all that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.7'>And now I have heard that you have shearers: now your shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask your young men, and they will show you. Wherefore let the young men find favour in yours eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray you, whatsoever comes to yours hand unto your servants, and to your son David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said unto his men, Gird all of you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he has requited me evil for good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.22'>So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisses against the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.23'>And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let yours handmaid, I pray you, speak in yours audience, and hear the words of yours handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I yours handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has withheld you from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with yours own hand, now let yours enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now this blessing which yours handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>I pray you, forgive the trespass of yours handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>Yet a man has risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of yours enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>That this shall be no grief unto you, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that you have shed blood causeless, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember yours handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent you this day to meet me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, which have kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, which has kept me back from hurting you, except you had hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisses against the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to yours house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD stroke Nabal, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying, David sent us unto you, to take you to him to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.41'>And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let yours handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.26'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered yours enemy into yours hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not strike him the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>David said furthermore, As the LORD lives, the LORD shall strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they got them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill far off; a great space being between them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.15'>And David said to Abner, Are not you a valiant man? and who is like to you in Israel? wherefore then have you not kept your lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, all of you are worthy to die, because all of you have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.15'>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known unto me what I shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.16'>Then said Samuel, Wherefore then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from you, and is become yours enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.17'>And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of yours hand, and given it to your neighbour, even to David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing unto you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, yours handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto your words which you spoke unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore, I pray you, hearken you also unto the voice of yours handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour you not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as all of you be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for you shall surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said unto him, To whom belong you? and whence are you? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongs to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David stroke them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>Then said David, All of you shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</verse>
