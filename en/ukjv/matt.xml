      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham brings forth Isaac; and Isaac brings forth Jacob; and Jacob brings forth Judas and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>And Judas brings forth Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares brings forth Esrom; and Esrom brings forth Aram;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>And Aram brings forth Aminadab; and Aminadab brings forth Naasson; and Naasson brings forth Salmon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>And Salmon brings forth Booz of Rachab; and Booz brings forth Obed of Ruth; and Obed brings forth Jesse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>And Jesse brings forth David the king; and David the king brings forth Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>And Solomon brings forth Roboam; and Roboam brings forth Abia; and Abia brings forth Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>And Asa brings forth Josaphat; and Josaphat brings forth Joram; and Joram brings forth Ozias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>And Ozias brings forth Joatham; and Joatham brings forth Achaz; and Achaz brings forth Ezekias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>And Ezekias brings forth Manasses; and Manasses brings forth Amon; and Amon brings forth Josias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>And Josias brings forth Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias brings forth Salathiel; and Salathiel brings forth Zorobabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>And Zorobabel brings forth Abiud; and Abiud brings forth Eliakim; and Eliakim brings forth Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>And Azor brings forth Sadoc; and Sadoc brings forth Achim; and Achim brings forth Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>And Eliud brings forth Eleazar; and Eleazar brings forth Matthan; and Matthan brings forth Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob brings forth Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was likewise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>And had sexual contact with her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when all of you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>And saying, Repent all of you: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare all of you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, (o. pneuma) and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit (o. pneuma) of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit (o. pneuma) into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word (o. rhema) that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>And says unto him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And says unto him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then says Jesus unto him, Get you behind, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he says unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately left their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed are the poor in spirit: (o. pneuma) for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are all of you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil (o. rhema) against you falsely, for my sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>All of you are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>All of you are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light unto all that are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, all of you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>All of you have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has ought against you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>Leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Agree with yours adversary quickly, while you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Verily I say unto you, You shall by no means come out thence, till you have paid the uttermost farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>All of you have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand offend you, cut it off, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It has been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause (o. logos) of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, all of you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not renounce swearing yourself, but shall perform unto the Lord yours oaths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shall you swear by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your communication (o. logos) be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these comes of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>All of you have heard that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say unto you, That all of you resist not evil: but whosoever shall strike you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whosoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>All of you have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbour, and hate yours enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore when you do yours alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>That yours alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He says unto them, How then does David in spirit (o. pneuma) call him Lord, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make yours enemies your footstool?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, (o. logos) he said unto his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble all of you the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he comes unto the disciples, and finds them asleep, and says unto Peter, What, could all of you not watch with me one hour?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful in order to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down they watched him there;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not all of you: for I know that all of you seek Jesus, which was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here: for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall all of you see him: lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>Saying, Say all of you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying (o. logos) is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go all of you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: (o. pneuma)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</verse>
