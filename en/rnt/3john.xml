  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>THE Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Beloved, I pray that in everything you may prosper and be in health, just as your soul now prospers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified to your truth \'97 that you are living in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>I have no greater joy than this: to hear that my children are living in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever work you do for the brethren, even when they are strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to help them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For it was for the Name that they came out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We ought to help such men so as to be fellow workers with the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who desires to be first among them, does not receive us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>Therefore, if I come I will bring to mind the works that he is doing, accusing us with wicked words, and not satisfied with that, neither does he receive the brethren, and he hinders those who wish to do so and expels them from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, do not imitate evil, but good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Testimony has been borne to Demetrius by all and by the truth itself. We too bear testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I had much to write to you, but I will not write to you with ink and pen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. The friends send greetings to you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
