  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>THE ancestral line of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac; Isaac was the father of Jacob; Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse was the father of David the King. David was the father of Solomon <note>his mother had been Uriah's wife</note>;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon was the father of Rehoboam; Rehoboam was the father of Abijah; Abijah was the father of Asa;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram; Joram was the father of Uzziah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah was the father of Jotham; Jotham was the father of Ahaz; Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the Babylonian exile, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel; Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud; Abiud was the father of Eliakim; Eliakim was the father of Azor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor was the father of Sadoc; Sadoc was the father of Achim; Achim was the father of Eliud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud was the father of Eleazar; Eleazar was the father of Matthan; Matthan was the father of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So there were in all fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>The birth of Jesus was in this way: His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph, her husband, being an upright man, and yet not willing to make her a public example, resolved to dismiss her privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking this over, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All this happened in fulfillment of what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel" <note>which means, God is with us</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took his wife to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>But he did not live with her as a husband until she had borne a son. He called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>AFTER Jesus had been born in Bethlehem, in Judaea, in the days of Herod the King, wise men from the East arrived at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, "Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the East and have come to do homage to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard it, he was disturbed, and so was all Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>Then he called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They said to him, "In Bethlehem, in Juda. For so it was written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>'And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for from thee will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them exactly the time of the star's appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and as he sent them to Bethlehem he said, "Go and make careful inquiries about the child, and when you have found him bring me word, so that I too may come and do homage to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After hearing the king, they journeyed on, and the star which they had seen in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they were very joyful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and presented to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>After this they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and so went by another mad back to their own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph and said, "Rise up, and take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child in order to kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So Joseph rose up, and took the child and his mother in the night and went away to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "Out of Egypt I called my Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he had been outwitted by the wise men, became furious, and sent out and killed all the boy babies two years old and under in Bethlehem and all its neighborhood, guided by the date which he had carefully learned from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But after Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>and said, "Arise, and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the child's life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>So he arose, and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being directed in a dream he went away to the region of Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and settled in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>IN those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wild part of Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, "Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was foretold through Isaiah the prophet when he said: 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>This John had his clothing of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the neighborhood of the Jordan</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said, "Brood of vipers, who directed you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Produce fruit fitting for a change of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think of saying to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Now the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptize you with water for a change of heart, but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I; I am not worthy to carry his shoes; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>He has his fan in his hand and will thoroughly clean his threshing-floor. He will gather his grain into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John opposed him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Jesus replied, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to complete every righteous act." Then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Jesus, as soon as he was baptized, went up from the water, and the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>A voice from the heavens said, "This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>THEN Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wild country to be tempted by the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>After he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>Then the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves of bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the Devil took him with him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the temple</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'To his angels he will give charge of you, and on their hands they will bear you lest you strike your foot against a stone.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "It is written, too, 'Thou shalt not try the Lord thy God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the Devil took him with him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, "All these things I will give you if you will fall down and do homage to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Jesus said to him, "Begone, Satan, for it is written, 'To the Lord thy God alone shalt thou do homage, and him alone shalt thou serve.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the Devil left him, and angels came and waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>When Jesus heard that John had been betrayed, he went away into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum on the lake shore on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, road to the sea, country beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people that sat in darkness saw a great light and upon those sitting in the land and shadow of death light dawned."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to proclaim and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>As he was walking along the shore of the lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They at once left the nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers \'97 James the son of Zebedee and John his brother \'97 in their boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They at once left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Jesus went around through the whole of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>His fame spread out into all Syria, and they brought to him all who were sick with various diseases and those suffering from acute pain, demoniacs, lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Great crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>SEEING the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he had seated himself his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>"Blessed are they that mourn! For they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>"Blessed are the gentle! For they will inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness! For they will have abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>"Blessed are the compassionate! For they will receive compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>"Blessed are the pure in heart! For they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>"Blessed are the peacemakers! For they will be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and say every evil thing against you falsely for my sake!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt becomes flat, with what can it be salted? It is good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hidden if set on a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>People do not light a lamp and put it under a peck-measure, but on the stand, and it gives light for all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to do away with them, but to fill them full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or part of a letter will pass away from the Law, until all is done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever breaks one of these commandments, the least of them, and teaches men to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, and whoever does them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you that, unless your righteousness far exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not commit murder. Whoever commits murder shall answer for it to the court.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>
          <note>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall answer for it to the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca' [empty-head], shall answer for it to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool' shall answer for it in the Gehenna of fire.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>So then if you are bringing your gift to lay on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and go, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Get on good terms with your adversary quickly while you are on the road with him, for fear that he may deliver you to the judge and the judge may deliver you to the officer and you may be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I tell you you will not come out until you pay the last penny."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman with lustful thoughts has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye is a snare to you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you that one of your members should be lost and not your whole body go into Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"It was said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, unless for the cause of unchastity, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform to the Lord thine oaths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>nor must you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your yes be yes and your no be no. Whatever is more than these is from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and if any one is determined to sue you for your tunic, let him have your cloak too;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and if any one commandeers you for a mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>To him who begs, give; from him who wishes to borrow of you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Jesus said to him, "Be sure and do not say a word to any one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Moses prescribed as evidence for them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>When Jesus had entered Capernaum there came to him a Centurion who implored his help.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>As they were going out, a dumb man who was also a demoniac was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>After the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke. The crowd wondered and said, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, "Through the Chief of the demons he casts out the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Jesus made a circuit through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>and said, 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What, therefore, God has yoked together let not man put asunder."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>WHEN they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>telling them, "Go into the village opposite and at once you will find an ass tied and a colt with her. Loose her and lead her to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If any one says anything to you, you will say, 'The Master has need of them,' and at once he will send them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>This happened in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy king comes to thee, gentle and riding on an ass and on a colt, the foal of a beast of draught."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>The disciples went and did as Jesus had bidden them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>and brought the ass and the colt, and spread on them their cloaks and seated him on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>A very large crowd spread their cloaks in the road, and others cut off branches from the trees and spread them in the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>The crowds that walked before and those that followed shouted, "God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God in highest heaven save him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When he entered Jerusalem all the city was shaken, and people said, "Who is this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Jesus went into the Temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were selling doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>and he said, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a den of robbers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Then blind men and lame men came to him in the Temple courts and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>When the high priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did and the children shouting, "God save the Son of David!" they were angry</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>and said to him, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said, "Yes. Have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>Early in the morning as he was returning to the city, he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and seeing a solitary fig tree at the roadside he went to it, but found on it nothing but leaves only. He said to it, "Let there no more be fruit from you forever." The fig tree immediately withered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>Upon seeing this, the disciples were astonished and said, "How suddenly the fig tree withered up!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus said to them, "I tell you truly, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' that will happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>and whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will obtain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>When he had gone into the Temple courts, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing this, and who gave you this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus replied to them, "I too will ask you one question. If you answer me, then I also will tell you by what authority I am doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>The baptism of John \'97 where did it come from? From heaven or from men?" They debated among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." He in turn said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go to-day and work in the vineyard.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>He answered, 'I will, Sir,' but he did not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>The father went to the second son and said the same. He answered, 'I will not,' but afterwards he changed his mind and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The last." Jesus said to them, "I tell you truly the tax collectors and the bad women are going before you into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>For John came to you in the path of righteousness and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the bad women believed him. And you when you saw it did not change your minds afterwards and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>"Listen to another illustration: There was a man, a house-holder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a wine-vat in it and built a watch-tower, and let it out to grape-growers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When the time of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the grape-growers to get his fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>But the grape-growers seized the servants, and one they beat, one they killed, one they pelted with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first, but they treated them just the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>At last he sent to them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But when the grape-growers saw the son, they said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When, therefore, the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those grape-growers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They said to him, "He will put those miserable men to a miserable death, and will let out the vineyard to other grape-growers who will render him the fruits in their seasons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, that one has become the corner stone. This stone came from the Lord and is wonderful in our eyes'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>Therefore I tell you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>Whoever falls on this stone will be shattered, and if it falls on any one, it will crush him to powder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>The high priests and the Pharisees listening to his illustrations knew that he was speaking about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>They were eager to seize him, but were afraid of the people, for the people held him for a prophet.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>AGAIN Jesus addressed them in figures. He said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Again he sent other servants, telling them, 'Say to those who have been invited, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fat things have been killed and everything is ready. Come to the wedding.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they paid no attention, and went off one to his field and another to his trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>The rest seized his servants, treated them roughly, and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>Then the king grew angry and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Go out on the crossroads, and every one you find invite to the wedding.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>So those servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding-hall was filled with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>When the king came in to look over the guests, he saw there a man who was not dressed in a wedding robe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding robe?' But he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>The king said to the attendants, 'Bind him feet and hands and throw him out into the darkness outside.' There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are invited, but few are chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went and held a consultation how they could entrap him in talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>They sent to him their disciples with the Herodians and they said, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and that you are afraid of no one, for you do not regard the social standing of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not disown you." And so said all of the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray yonder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sad, even to death. Stay here and watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Then he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "So you could not watch one hour with me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray so as not to enter into temptation. Your spirit is eager, but your flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again a second time he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>So he left them and went away again and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "You are sleeping on and resting! Now has come the hour when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Up, let us be going. Here comes my betrayer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>The traitor had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is he. Arrest him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>Immediately he came up to Jesus and said, "Good evening, Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here for." Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Suddenly one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot call on my Father and have him send to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that so it must be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out to seize me as if against a robber, with swords and clubs? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you did not arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>The men who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, at whose house the scribes and elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the court of the High Priest, and went in and sat among the attendants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>The high priests and the whole council sought for false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But they did not find any, although many false witnesses came. Finally, two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This man said, 'I can pull down the Temple of God and in three days build it up again.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>The High Priest rose and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is it that these are testifying to against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus kept silence. The High Priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "I am he. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the High Priest rent his garments, saying, "Impious words! Why do we any longer need witnesses? See, you have now heard his impious words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?" They answered, "He deserves death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Act the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you? "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Peter was sitting outside in the court. A maid came up to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Then again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for your accent proves it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man." Immediately the cock crew, and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Peter remembered what Jesus had said, "Before the cock crows you will disown me three times," and he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>WHEN morning came all the high priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>After binding him, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus had been condemned, was sorry and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I sinned in betraying innocent blood!" But they said, "What is that to us? You must see to that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Then throwing the silver into the Temple he left and went and hung himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The high priests took the money and said, "It is not proper to put it in with the consecrated gifts, since it is the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>So after consultation they bought with it the potter's field for the burial of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>For this reason that field is called the "Field of Blood" to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what was said through Jeremiah the prophet, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom they priced from the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Jesus stood before the Governor. The Governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>While he was being accused by the high priests and elders, he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But Jesus did not answer even one word, so that the Governor was much astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>At every feast the Governor was accustomed to release for the people one prisoner, whomever they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>There was at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So, when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that out of jealousy they had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent to him a message, "Do not have anything to do with that righteous man. For I have suffered much to-day in a dream because of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>The high priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The Governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "What, then, shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Have him crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>He said, "Why, what wrong has he done?" But they kept shouting furiously, "Have him crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>When Pilate saw that he was doing no good, but rather that an uproar was arising, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd and said, "I am innocent of this blood. You will have to see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>All the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas for them, but scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus with them into the castle and gathered about him all the battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They stripped him and put on him a crimson cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, put a reed into his right hand, and, going down on their knees before him, made sport of him, shouting, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>They spit on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>After they had finished making sport of him, they took off from him the crimson cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucifixion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they were going out, they chanced upon a man from Cyrene by the name of Simon. This man they impressed to carry the cross of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>On coming to a place called Golgotha <note>that is, Skull Place</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. He tasted it and would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then they sat and kept watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>Above his head they put up the charge against him in writing: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>At the same time there were crucified along with him two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>The people who went by insulted him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You who can pull down the Temple and in three days build it up, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In the same way the high priests, making sport of him, along with the scribes and elders, kept saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God, let him deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>In the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him insulted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>From noon darkness came over all the land until three o'clock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of those who were standing there said, when they heard it, "This man is calling for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave him a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>The rest said, "Let him alone, let us see whether Elijah comes to save him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>But Jesus, after calling out again with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>Suddenly the curtain of the Temple was rent in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked. The rocks were split,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened and many bodies of the sleeping saints arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and, coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>The Centurion and his men who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, were greatly terrified and said, "Truly this man was a son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Looking on from a distance, were many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, waiting upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>In the late afternoon there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone up to the door of the tomb and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Magdalene remained there and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>On the next day, that is, the day after the Preparation, the high priests and the Pharisees gathered about Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>and said, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was alive, 'After three days I shall be raised up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>So give orders to have the tomb guarded until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last error will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You may have a guard. Go make it as secure as you know how."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>They went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone as well as setting a watch.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>LATE on the Sabbath, as the first day of the week was drawing near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the stone and rolled it away and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>For fear of him the guards trembled violently and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>The angel said to the women, "Do not you be afraid. For I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here. He has been raised, as he told you. Come see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Go quickly and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead. He will precede you to Galilee. There you will see him. See, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>They left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" They came up and clasped his feet and bowed down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and take the message to my disciples to go away to Galilee and there they will see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While they were going, some of the guard came into the city and brought word to the high priests of all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>After assembling with the elders and holding a consultation, they gave a good deal of money to the soldiers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>and said, "Say, 'His disciples came in the night and stole him away while we were asleep,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>and if this comes to the ears of the Governor we will persuade him and free you from trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this report has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed to meet them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>and they saw him and bowed down before him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Jesus came to them and talked with them. He said, "To me has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
