  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>INASMUCH as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative of those facts which are firmly believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and who became bearers of the message handed them down to us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it has seemed good to me also \'97 since I have followed everything from the beginning accurately \'97 to write a consecutive account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the exact truth in regard to the matters which you have been taught by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, King of Judaea, a certain priest by the name of Zacharias, of the course of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>It happened that as Zacharias was performing his priestly duties before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him to enter the Temple of the Lord and offer the incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>All the congregation of people was in prayer outside, at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>There appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>Zacharias, on seeing him, was alarmed and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son, and you will call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>You will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great before the Lord. He will not drink wine or strong drink. He will be full of the Holy Spirit even from his birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>and many of the sons of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Zacharias said to the angel, "By what proof shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered, "I am Gabriel, who stands before the face of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to give you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that this comes to pass, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering at his staying so long in the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When the days of his priestly service were finished, he went away to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"So has the Lord done for me in the days in which he has looked upon me to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The name of the virgin was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>The angel entered and said to her, "Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was alarmed at his words, and wondered what such a greeting could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>The angel said to her, "Do not fear, Mary; for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>You will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you must call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>He will be king over the house of Jacob through the ages, and of his kingdom there will be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>But Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am not united to a man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Highest will overshadow you. For that reason the child that is begotten will be called holy, Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And, indeed, Elizabeth your relative, even she, has conceived a son, in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For "no word that comes from God will fail."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Mary said, "Here I am, the Lord's handmaid. Let it be to me according to your word." Then the angel left her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill-country to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But why do I have the honor of having the mother of my Lord come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, indeed, when the sound of your greeting fell upon my ears, the babe leapt for joy in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a complete fulfillment of the things spoken to her from the Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because he has looked upon the low estate of his handmaid. Indeed, from this time all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Because the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>His kindness is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He shows strength with his arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He casts down princes from their thrones and raises up the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry he fills with good things and the affluent he sends away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He brings help to Israel his servant, mindful of kindness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>just as he promised our fathers, Abraham and his descendants, forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>When Elizabeth's due time came, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great kindness to her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>But his mother said, "No, but he shall be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, "There is no one of your family who is called by that name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>Then they made signs to his father to know what he wanted him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for a tablet and wrote, "His name is John." They all wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>At once Zacharias's mouth was opened and his tongue loosed and he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Awe fell on all their neighbors, and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these matters were talked about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All who heard them laid them up in their minds, saying, "What then will this child be?" For the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Zacharias, his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and said prophetically:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! For he has looked upon his people, and made deliverance for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those that hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>Dealing kindly with our forefathers, mindful of his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>To grant that we, saved from the hands of our enemies, may serve him Without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High. You will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give the knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender compassion of our God, With which the sunrise from on high will shine upon us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, To guide our feet into the path of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he lived in the wilds until the day of his appearance before Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>IN those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This first registration took place while Cyrenius was Governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>Everybody went to be registered \'97 each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered with Mary who was betrothed to him, and was with child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there, her time came</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she gave birth to her son, her first-born, and she wrapped him up and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the fields and keeping watch over their flocks by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them. They were much afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>but the angel said to them, "Have no fear! Indeed, I am bringing you good news of a great joy which is to be for all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for there was born for you to-day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ and Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>This will be a sign for you: you will find the babe wrapped up and lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude from the army of heaven, praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory in highest heaven to God, and peace on earth among men in whom he delights."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>When the angels went away into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another: "Let us go to Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>So they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>When they saw it, they told what had been spoken to them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All who heard it wondered at what was said to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>When eight days had passed and the time to circumcise him had come, his name was called Jesus \'97 the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>When the days of their purification were completed, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to give an offering according to what is said in the law of the Lord, "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>There was in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, and this man was upright and God-fearing, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he was not to see death before he saw the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Led by the Spirit he came into the Temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus in order to do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him into his arms and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Now, O Lord, thou art letting thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation to Gentiles and a glory to thy people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>His father and his mother wondered at the things that were spoken about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, "This child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel and for a sign much spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>
          <note>yes a sword will pierce your own soul</note> in order that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and having been a widow for now eighty-four years. She never left the Temple courts, but worshiped by fastings and prayers, night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>She too came up at that time and praised God and spoke about him to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>When they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>The child grew and became strong and was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>His parents used to go up every year to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When he had reached the age of twelve years, and they had gone up according to the custom of the feast</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and had completed the days and were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But his parents did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>Thinking that he was in the company, they went a day's journey. But when they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>On the third day they found him in the Temple courts, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>When his parents saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, "Child, why have you treated us so? See, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He said to them, "Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be at my Father's?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>They did not understand the words that he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then he went down with them, and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus grew in wisdom and in height and in favor with God and with men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>IN the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judaea and Herod Prince of Galilee, and Philip his brother Prince of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Prince of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wild lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>Then he came into all the neighborhood of the Jordan proclaiming baptism for a change of heart in order to forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one shouting in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every ravine shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be graded down, and the crooked places shall become straight and the rough roads shall become smooth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all men shall see the salvation of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>He said to the crowds that went out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Produce then fruits suitable for a change of heart, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father.' For I tell you, God is able out of these stones to raise up children for Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not yield good fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>The crowds asked him, "What then shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered, "Let him who has two tunics give to him who has none, and let him who has food do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Some tax collectors came to be baptized and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>He said to them, "Do nothing beyond what you are authorized."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>Jesus arose and left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon. Simon's wife's mother was suffering from a severe fever, and they asked him to help her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>He came and stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her. At once she rose up and waited upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>As the sun was setting, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he put his hands on each of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons came out of many, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and did not permit them to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>When morning came, he went out and departed to a solitary place. The crowds were looking for him and came to where he was and tried to hinder his going away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them, "I must tell the good news about the kingdom of God in the other cities also, because for this I have been sent."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>IT happened that, as the crowd was pressing upon him and listening to the word of God, he was standing on the shore of Lake Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two boats by the shore. The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>He got into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to push off a little from the land. Then, sitting down, he taught the people from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, "Push out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, "Master, we have worked all night and caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>When they had done this, they enclosed a great mass of fishes and their nets began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>They beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them. They came, and both the boats were filled so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down on his knees before Jesus and said, "Leave my boat and me, Sir, for I am a sinful man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For amazement seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fishes they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>It was just the same with James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon, "Never fear; from now on you will be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>Then they brought their boats to land and left all and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>It happened that, when he was in one of the cities, there was a man present full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, "Sir, if you will, you can cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I will it; be cleansed." Immediately the leprosy left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>Jesus commanded him to tell no one. "But go," he said, "and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for evidence to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But all the more the reports about him spread, and great crowds came together to hear and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he stayed out in the wild country and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>It happened on one of those days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting who had come from every village of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Then came some men bearing on a bed a man who was paralytic, and they tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>When they could not contrive to bring him in on account of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiles with his pallet into the midst in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>He saw their faith and said, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and Pharisees began to argue, saying, "Who is this man who speaks profane words? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus perceived their arguing and asked them, "What are you arguing in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on the earth to forgive sins" \'97 he said to the paralytic \'97 "I tell you, Rise and take up your pallet and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he stood up before them and took up what he had been lying on and went away to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Amazement seized them all and they gave glory to God, yet they were also filled with awe, and said, "We have seen astonishing things today!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this he went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>Leaving everything, he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi held a great reception for him at his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>The Pharisees and their scribes grumbled to his disciples, and said, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them, "The well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call righteous men, but sinners to a change of heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>They said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do those of the Pharisees, but your followers eat and drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>Jesus said to them, "Can you make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast \'97 in those days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He gave them also some illustrations. "No one tears a piece from a new cloak and sews it on an old cloak. If he did, he would make a tear in his new cloak, and even in the old cloak the patch taken from the new would not match.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wine-skins. If he did, the new wine would burst the skins and it would be spilled, and the skins would be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into new wine-skins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one after drinking old wine wishes to drink new, for he says, 'The old is fine.' "</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, he and the men with him \'97 </verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>The scribes and Pharisees watched to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, wishing to find something to accuse him of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand in the center." He rose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>He looked around at all of them, then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with blind fury, and discussed with one another what they could do to Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>The servant of a certain Centurion was sick and about to die. He was highly valued by his master,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>who hearing about Jesus sent to him some elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>When they came to Jesus they begged him earnestly, saying, "He deserves to have this done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the Centurion sent friends to say to him, "Do not trouble yourself, Sir, for I am not fit to have you come under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>On that account I did not think myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and have my servant cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I am a man \'97 under authority \'97 with soldiers under me, and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to that one, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard this, he wondered, and, turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, "I tell you, in Israel I have not found such faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>Those who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>It happened soon afterwards that he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd were going along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he approached the gate of the city, they were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A great crowd from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Master saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>and he went up and touched the bier. The bearers stopped. He said, "Young man, I say, arise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>The dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>All were awe-struck, and they gave praise to God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us and God has visited his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>The reports about him spread through all Judaea and all the region of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>John's disciples told him about all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>So he called to him two of his disciples and sent them to the Master to ask, "Are you 'the Coming One' or are we to expect some other person?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When they came to him, the men said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, Are you 'the Coming One' or are we to expect some other person?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that very time he was curing many of diseases and pains and wicked spirits, and to many blind people he was giving sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>He answered them, "Go and relate to John what you have seen and heard. Blind men see, lame men walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf men hear, dead men are raised, poor men hear good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>Blessed is he who does not stumble through misunderstanding me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>After John's messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wild country to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Indeed, the people in splendid clothing and living in luxury are in kings' palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>For this is he about whom it was written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will make ready your way before you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you there is not among those born of women a greater than John. But an inferior in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>(All the people, even the tax collectors when they heard him, had confessed that God was right by being baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and the lawyers had thwarted the purpose of God in reference to themselves by not being baptized by him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>"To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another, 'We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We mourned but you did not wail!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist has come, not eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'See there a man who is a glutton and wine-drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>Yet Wisdom is shown to be in the right by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees kept asking him to dine with him. Entering the house of this Pharisee, he reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>Now there was a certain woman in the city, a sinner, and when she learned that he was at table in the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and took her place behind, beside his feet, weeping. Her tears began to rain down on his feet, and with the hair of her head she wiped them off, and she passionately kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said within himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what this woman who is touching him is, for she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus, answering his thought, said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he said, "say it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>"A certain money-lender had two debtors; one owed him five hundred shillings; the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>Because they had nothing to pay with, he graciously forgave both. Which of them will love him most?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, "I suppose the one to whom he forgave most." He said to him, "You have answered correctly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet. But she has rained tears upon my feet and has wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss, but she, since I came in, has not ceased passionately kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>My head with oil you did not anoint, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>For this reason I tell you her sins, many as they are, have been forgiven, for she loved much. For he to whom little is forgiven loves little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>He said to her, "Your sins have been forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>The other guests began to say to themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>SHORTLY afterwards he was making his way through cities and villages preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been relieved of evil spirits and infirmities \'97 Mary, who was called Magdalene, out of whom seven demons had gone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod's manager, and Susanna, and many others. These women provided for Jesus and his apostles out of their means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>When a great multitude was coming together and some from every city were crowding upon him, he spoke to them with an illustration:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>"A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some seed fell along the roadside and was trodden on, and the birds of heaven ate it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>Other seed fell on the rock, and when it sprang up it withered away because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>Other seed fell into the good ground, and grew up and yielded a harvest a hundred fold." When he said this, he called out, "Let him who has ears to hear, hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>His disciples kept asking him what the illustration meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He said: "To you it is granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. But to the rest the message comes in figures of speech, so that although they see they may not see, and although they hear they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>This is the illustration: The seed is the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the roadside are those who hear, and then the Devil comes and takes away the message from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>Those on the rock are those who, though they receive the message with joy, yet have no root, who for a while believe, but in the time of trial desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>That which fell among thorns means those who hear, and as they go on are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring nothing to completion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>That in the good ground means those who with a noble and good heart hear the message and hold it fast and bear fruit in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>"No one lights a lamp and hides it with a bowl or puts it under a bed. No, he puts it on a stand so that all who come in may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, nor secret which will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Be careful, then, how you hear; for whoever has, to him will be given, and whoever has not, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>His mother and his brothers came where he was, but could not get to him on account of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>It was told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>He answered, "My mother and my brothers are these who are hearing the word of God and doing it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>It happened one day that he got into a boat, and his disciples went with him. He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." They put out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>While they were sailing he fell asleep. A gale of wind came down on the lake and the boat was filling and in peril.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>Coming to him, they awoke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are going down!" He awoke and rebuked the wind and the waves. They grew quiet and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He said to the disciples, "Where is your faith?" They were awed and amazed, and said to one another, "Who then is this man who commands the winds and the water and they obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They sailed to the land of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When he got out on to the land, there met him a certain man from that city who had demons. For a long time he had not worn clothes and had not lived in a house, but in the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he screamed and fell down before him, and in a loud voice said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I pray you, do not torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and, though he was bound with chains and fetters and kept under guard, yet bursting his chains he would be driven by the demon off into the wilds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>They begged him not to bid them go away into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>There was near by a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. The demons begged him to permit them to go into the swine. He gave them leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The demons left the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The herdsmen, seeing what had happened, fled and told it in the city and on the farms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>The people came out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were struck with awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>Those who had seen it told them how the demoniac had been cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Whereupon all the crowd from the region of the Gerasenes asked him to go away from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into a boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged him to let him be with him. But he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your home and tell how much God has done for you." He went through the whole city proclaiming how much Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>As Jesus came back, a crowd welcomed him, for all were expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>There came a man by the name of Jairus \'97 he was a synagogue director. Falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged him to come to his house</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he was going the crowds pressed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and could not be cured by any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came up behind him and touched the tassel of his cloak. At once her hemorrhage ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus said, "Who is it that touched me?" All denied, and Peter said, "Master, the crowd is pressing upon you on every side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>Jesus said, "Some one touched me, for I know that power has gone forth from me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>The woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling and fell before him, and told before all the people why she had touched him and how she was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking some one came from the Director's house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher any longer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus heard it and said to him, "Never fear. Only believe and she will be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When he came to the house, he did not permit any one to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father of the child and her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>All were weeping and wailing for her. He said, "Do not weep. She is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took hold of her hand and said to her, "Little girl, rise up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Her spirit returned and at once she stood up. He told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were amazed, but he told them not to tell any one of what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>JESUS called together the twelve and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>Then he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey, no stick, no bag, no bread, no money, nor have so much as two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>Whoever do not receive you \'97 as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>Going forth, they began telling the good news from village to village and performing cures everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Herod the Prince heard of all that was going on, and he was at a loss because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that some one of the old prophets had arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said, "John I beheaded. Who is this about whom I hear such things?" And he made efforts to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>The apostles returned and told Jesus all that they had done. Taking them with him, he went away privately to a city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>The crowds found it out and followed him. He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>When the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go to the villages and farms around and put up for the night and find food, for here we are in the wild lands."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>He said to them, "Give them something to eat yourselves." They replied, "We have not more than five loaves and two fishes. We cannot go and buy food for all this crowd, can we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Have them recline in rows of fifty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did so, and made all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Taking the five loaves and the fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them and broke them and gave to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>They all ate and had abundance, and what was left over was picked up \'97 twelve baskets of fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Once when he was praying alone, his disciples joined him, and he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, "John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others that some one of the old prophets has arisen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he rebuked him, and charged them not to say this to any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>telling them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and high priests and be killed, and on the third day be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>He said to all: "If any one chooses to come after me, let him disown himself and take up his cross every day and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>He who chooses to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what will it profit a man to gain the whole world if he has lost or forfeited himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in his glory and that of his Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after this conversation, Jesus took with him Peter and John and James and went up the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became radiant white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>Suddenly two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and spoke of his passing which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Peter and his companions had been weighed down with sleep, but becoming fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>As they were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is fine for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was saying it there came a cloud and over-shadowed them. They were frightened as they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>Then a voice came from the cloud saying, "This is my Son, the Chosen, listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice came, Jesus was there alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>On the next day, as they were coming down from the mountain, a great crowd met him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>and suddenly a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I pray you look at my son, for he is my only one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>and see, a spirit seizes him and all at once he shrieks. It convulses him till he foams and it hardly leaves off tormenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long must I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>Even while he was coming, the demon dashed him down and convulsed him. Jesus rebuked the impure spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>They were amazed at the greatness of God. While they were all wondering at all the things that he did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>"Receive these words into your ears. The Son of Man will soon be betrayed into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this remark, and it was hidden from them so that they did not take it in, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>A dispute started among them as to which of them was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>Jesus knew the question that was in their minds, and he took a little child and stood him beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes him who sent me. For he who is least among you all, he is great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John answered, "Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he is not following along with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, "Do not stop him, for he who is not against you is for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>As the days before his being taken up to heaven were passing, he set his face to go to Jerusalem</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>ONCE he was in a certain place praying. When he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, "Master, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>But he, knowing their reasonings, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and a house divided against itself falls.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>THE Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>The high priests and the scribes were intent upon finding some way to destroy Jesus; for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>But Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>and he went away and talked over with the high priests and officers how he could betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>He promised, and was on the lookout for an opportunity to betray him to them when the crowd was not with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>The day of unleavened bread came, when the Passover lamb must be sacrificed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>and Jesus sent Peter and John, telling them, "Go and make ready the Passover for us so that we may eat it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They said to him, "Where do you wish us to make ready?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He said, "As you are entering the city a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house that he enters</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>and say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is the dining room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you an upper room, large and furnished. There make ready."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>They went away and found everything just as he had said, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the hour came, he reclined at table and the apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>He said to them, "I have strongly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>For, I tell you, I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>He took a cup and gave thanks and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>For, I say to you, I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>Then he took a loaf and gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>He took the cup in the same manner after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>But, see, the hand of the traitor is with me on the table!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>The Son of Man is going, as it is appointed, but alas for that man by whom he is betrayed!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>They began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There was also a dispute among them as to which of them should be regarded as superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those of them who exercise authority are called benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But you are not to be so. The greatest among you is to be like the youngest and the leader like him who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For which is superior, he who reclines at table or he who serves? Is not he who reclines? But I am in the midst of you as the one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You are those who have stood by me in my trials</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>and I will assign to you, as my Father has assigned to me, a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>Simon, Simon, Satan has begged to be allowed to sift all of you like wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail. And when you come back to yourself, strengthen your brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>Peter said to him, "Master, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow to-day before you three times deny that you know me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, did you lack for anything?" They said, "We lacked for nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He said to them, "But now whoever has a purse must take it, and so with a bag, and he who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I tell you that the prophecy must be fulfilled in me \'97 the prophecy, 'He was numbered among the lawless.' For what concerns me is coming to an end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>They said, "Master, here are two swords." He said to them, "That is enough."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>He went out and made his way, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>When he came to the place, he said to them, "Pray not to enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>He parted from them about a stone's throw and kneeled down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>"Father, if thou wilt, take away this cup from me. Yet not my will, but thine, be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>An angel from heaven appeared to him strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood failing upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>Then he rose from prayer and came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came up to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jesus said to him, "Judas, is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Those about Jesus, seeing what was going to happen, said, "Master, shall we strike with the sword?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>One of them did strike the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But Jesus said, "Let me at least do this," and he touched his ear and healed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Jesus said to the high priests and officers of the Temple and elders who had come out against him, "You come out with swords and clubs, just as if after a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>In the daytime while I was with you in the Temple courts you did not stretch out your hands to take me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>After arresting him they led him away and brought him into the house of the High Priest. Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>They lighted a fire in the center of the court and seated themselves around it, and Peter seated himself in the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>A maid saw him sitting near the light, and, looking hard at him, said, "This man was with him too."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>After a short space another \'97 a man \'97 saw him, and said, "You too are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour later, another man asserted positively, "Truly this man was with him too, for he is a Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about." Immediately while he was speaking the cock crew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>and the Master turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Master, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows to-day you will disown me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>The men who had arrested Jesus made sport of him, beating him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and, after blindfolding him, they asked him, "Prophesy who it is that struck you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>Many other insulting words they said to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>When daylight came, the eldership of the people assembled, both high priests and scribes, and they led him to their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>"If you are the Christ, tell us." He said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>If I question you, you will not answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>But from this time the Son of Man will be seated at the powerful right hand of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>They all said, "You then are the Son of God?" He said to them, "I am what you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>They said, "Why do we need any more testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>THEN the whole assemblage arose and led him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>They began accusing him, saying, "We have found this man corrupting our nation and opposing the payment of tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the high priests and the crowd, "I find nothing criminal in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they were violent in saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judaea. Starting in Galilee, he is now here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>Pilate, on hearing of Galilee, asked if the man was a Galilaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>and when he learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction he sent him to Herod, who was himself also in Jerusalem during those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Herod on seeing Jesus was much pleased because for a long time he had been anxious to see him on account of hearing about him, and he was hoping to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He questioned him with many words; but Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>The high priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Herod along with his soldiers treated him with contempt and after making sport of him and putting a gorgeous robe on him, sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that day. Previously they had been at enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate called together the high priests and the rulers and the people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, "You have brought before me this man as one who misguides the people, and yet I, in examining him before you, have found in this man not one criminal thing of all that you charge against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>No more has Herod; for he has sent him back to us. See, nothing deserving of death has been done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>So I will scourge him and release him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But the whole crowd cried out together, "Put him out of the way and free Barabbas for us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>
          <note>Barabbas, on account of a riot that had occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into prison.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Again Pilate spoke to them, wishing to release Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they shouted, "Crucify him, crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>For the third time he said to them, "What wrong has he done? I have found nothing criminal in him. I will therefore scourge him and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they insisted with loud voices asking to have him crucified, and their voices prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate gave sentence that what they asked should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He freed the man who for riot and murder had been thrown into prison \'97 the man they asked for; but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a Cyrenian coming from the country, and laid on him the cross to bear behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>There followed him a great crowd of people and of women who were beating their breasts and bewailing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed a babe!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin and say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and to the hills, 'Hide us!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>There were also two others, criminals, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." They divided his clothes by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>The people stood looking on. The rulers scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers made sport of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was a writing over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>One of the criminals who were crucified insulted him, "Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other rebuked him and said, "Have you no fear of God, since you are under the same sentence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we are here justly, for we are receiving our due for our deeds. But this man has done nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jesus said to him, "I tell you truly to-day you will be with me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was now about noon, and darkness came over all the land until three,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>the sun being eclipsed. And the curtain in the Temple was torn in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>Then Jesus said in a loud voice, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit." After saying this, he breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>When the Centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, "Certainly this was an upright man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds that had stood by looking on the scene, after seeing what happened, turned away beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>All his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee were standing at a distance looking on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>There was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>who had not participated in their plan and action. He was of Arimathaea, a city of the Judaeans, and was looking for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>He took it down and wrapped it in fine linen and laid him in a tomb cut in the rock where no one was yet lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>It was the day of Preparation and the Sabbath was about to begin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed along and saw the tomb and how his body was laid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>and they went back and prepared perfumes and ointments. On the Sabbath they abstained from work according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>BUT on the first day of the week at early dawn they came to the tomb, bringing the perfumes which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and on entering they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were at a loss about this, suddenly two men in glittering robes stood beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>They were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why are you looking for the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and rise on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered his words</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and turned back from the tomb and told all this to the eleven and all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them also told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>But these reports seemed in their eyes like idle talk. They did not believe the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb and stooping down he saw nothing but the linen cloths, and he went away to his place wondering at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>On that day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, seven miles distant from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and they were talking to each other about all these occurrences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>It happened as they talked and discussed that Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were restrained from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>He said to them, "What are these matters that you are debating with each other as you walk?" They stood still with sad faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>One of them, named Cleopas, said to him, "Are you a stranger living alone in Jerusalem and do you not know the things that have happened there in recent days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>how our high priests and leading men handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that he was the one who was to redeem Israel. But now, however, the third day is passing since these things took place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yet some women from our company amazed us. They went at dawn to the tomb</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and did not find his body, but came back saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>Some of our company went out to the tomb and found things as the women had said, but they did not see him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Jesus said to them, "O men lacking insight and slow in heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>They drew near to the village where they were going and he acted as if he were going on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the sun is already low." So he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>As he reclined at table with them, he took the bread and blessed it and broke it and gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>They said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us when he was talking to us on the road and was explaining the Scriptures to us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>Then, rising that very hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their associates assembled</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>and saying, "Really the Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>They then narrated what had happened on the road and how they knew him by his breaking the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they were talking of these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said to them, "Peace be with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>They were terrified and much alarmed, and thought that they were seeing a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>But he said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>See my hands and my feet \'97 that it is I myself. Feel me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While they still were doubting for joy and wondering, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took it and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>He said to them, "This is what I said to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and he said to them, "Thus it is written that the Christ is to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and in his name change of heart for forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And, see, I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>He led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>While he was blessing them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>They bowed down before him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were constantly in the Temple courts blessing God.</verse>
