  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>PAUL, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the Holy who are at Ephesus, faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly heights in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and spotless before him in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>He predestined us to recognition as sons to himself through Jesus Christ according to the kindness of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>to the praise of his glorious grace which he bestowed on us in the Beloved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the wealth of his loving kindness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>He has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his grace which he purposed in him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>for the government of the fullness of the ages, to bring to unity all things in Christ, both things in the heavens and things on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>In him we were predestined according to the plan of him who works in all things according to the purpose of his will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>and we were made God's heritage in order that we might bring praise to his glory \'97 we who first have fixed our hope on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In him you also, after hearing the message of the truth, the good news of your salvation, and putting your faith in him, were sealed by the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>which is the pledge of our inheritance in anticipation of the full redemption of God's own people to the praise of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>For this reason I also, since hearing of your faith in Jesus and your love to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>never cease giving thanks for you when I mention you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>enlightening the eyes of your heart, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the glorious wealth of his inheritance in the holy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the inworking of his vast might,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he put forth in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his own right hand in the heavenly heights,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>far above every archangel and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this world but also in the world to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>He put all things under his feet and placed him as head over all for the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>YOU also God raised to life when you were dead in misdeeds and sins</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which you once walked, following the ways of this age of the world, led by the Ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>Among these we all lived once in the passions of our flesh and of our thoughts, and we were by nature children of wrath like the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>even when we were dead in misdeeds, made us alive along with Christ \'97 by grace we have been saved \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us up with him and made us sit with him in the heavenly heights in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>that he might show in the ages to come the surpassing richness of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, that no one may boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his work, formed in Christ Jesus for good works in which God had prepared beforehand to have us live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Therefore remember that once you were Gentiles in the flesh and were called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>and that you were then apart from Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far have become near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace. He has made both Jew and Gentile one and has broken down the dividing wall, the enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>In his own flesh he has ended the force of the law of commandments in ordinances in order to make the two, in himself, into one new man, thus making peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and in order to reconcile both in one body to God through his cross, by slaying the enmity by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And he came and brought the good news of peace to you who were far and peace to those who were near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>For through him we, both Jews and Gentiles, have access through one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>So then you are no longer strangers and resident aliens, but fellow citizens with the holy and members of the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>In him all the building, framed together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>in whom you also are being built for a dwelling of God in the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>FOR this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if you have heard of the gracious commission which God has given me to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>that by revelation the mystery has been disclosed to me, as I wrote before briefly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>In reading that letter you can learn my understanding in the mystery of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>a mystery which was not disclosed in other generations to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>namely, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I became a servant according to the free grace of God which was given me by the inworking of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, the least of all the holy, has this grace been given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the unsearchable riches of Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>and to show what is the working of the mystery which has been hidden for ages in God, who created all things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>in order to disclose now to the archangels and powers in the heavenly heights, through the church, the varied wisdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>according to the eternal purpose which he has accomplished by Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>So I beg you not to lose heart because of the distresses that come on me for your sake. They are a high honor to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>For this reason I bow my knees to the Father</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he may grant to you according to his glorious wealth to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you, rooted and founded in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>may be able with all the holy to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>yes, to know the love of Christ, which yet surpasses knowledge, and may be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>To him who is able to do far beyond all we ask or think by the power that works in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus through all the generations of the ages! Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I, THE prisoner of the Lord, beg you, then, to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>with all modesty and gentleness, being slow to anger, bearing with one another in love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>earnest in keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called with one hope that belongs to your calling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Therefore it says, "He ascended on high; he led away captives; he gave gifts to men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>What does "he ascended" mean, except that he had descended into the lowest parts of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who descended is also he who "ascended" high above all the heavens to fill all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he "gave" to some to be apostles, some prophets, some tellers of the good news, some shepherds and teachers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the equipment of the saints, for the work of service, for building up the body of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we all attain oneness in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, and the maturity of manhood and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>Then we shall be no longer children tossed and borne about by every wind of teaching through the trickery of men and craftiness in the devices of deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but speaking the truth in love we shall grow wholly into him who is the head, Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>from whom the whole body framed together and strengthened by what every joint supplies vigorously, in the measure of each, makes growth in building itself up in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This then I say and solemnly protest in the Lord: that you are no longer to live as the Gentiles live in vacancy of mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having their understanding darkened, aliens from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, and because of the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>Lost to any sense of shame they have abandoned themselves to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you have not so learned Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if you have heard him and have been taught in him as the truth is in Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>that you should put away the old man who belonged to your former way of life and was perishing in deluding passions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and that you should be made new in the spirit of your minds</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and put on the new man formed as God approves in the righteousness and holiness of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore put aside lying and speak truth every one to his neighbor, for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>"Be angry and do not sin." Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>neither give place for the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>He who steals must steal no longer, but rather he must labor, working with his own hands something good, so as to have something to share with any one in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no vile word come out of your mouth, but, if anything, a good word for needed upbuilding of character to give grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and abusive language be put away from you with every kind of malice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>Be kind to one another, sympathetic, forgiving one another just as God in Christ has forgiven you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>BE imitators of God as beloved children</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to God yielding a fragrant odor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>Unchastity or any kind of impurity or greediness must not be mentioned among you, as befits holy people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>nor should there be indecent and foolish talk or jesting, which are unbecoming, but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>For you know well that no unchaste or impure person, no greedy person \'97 who is an idolater \'97 has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>Let no one deceive you with empty words; for because of these things the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Do not, then, be partakers with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>for the fruit of light appears in all generosity and righteousness and truth \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>testing what is pleasing to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>for the things that they do in secret it is shameful even to speak of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things when reproved are shown truly by the light, for everything shown truly is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore it says, "Wake, O sleeper, and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>Be strictly careful, then, how you live, not as unwise but as wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>Buy up the opportunity, because these are evil days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not be thoughtless, but understand what is the Lord's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>Do not be drunk with wine, in which there is profligacy, but be full of the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and playing the harp heartily to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>Be subject to one another in reverence for Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>wives to their own husbands as in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>because a man is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Christ, so wives are to their husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might make it holy, cleansing it by the washing with water according to his word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that he might present to himself the church glorious, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and faultless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Thus ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>for no one ever hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>for we are members of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>"This mystery is great, but I am speaking of Christ and the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>But each one of you must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must reverence her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>"Honor your father and your mother." This is the first commandment with a promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>"That it may go well with you and you may be long-lived in the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>And you, fathers, do not irritate your children, but bring them up in the education and admonition of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Slaves, obey those who according to the flesh are your masters, with reverence and awe in singleness of your hearts as to Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not with eye service as pleasers of men, but as Christ's slaves, doing the will of God in a whole-souled way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>giving service with cheerfulness as to the Lord and not to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good thing each one does that he will be rewarded for by the Lord, whether he be slave or free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>And you, masters, do the same by them, avoiding threats, knowing that the Master both of them and of you is in the heavens, and there is no partiality for rank with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>To conclude: Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put on the complete armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the cunning arts of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the arch-angels, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly heights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Therefore take the complete armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and, after going through everything, to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand, then, belted with truth, wearing the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>shod with the readiness of the good news of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>In every event take up the shield of faith by which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Evil One,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>and accept the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</verse>
