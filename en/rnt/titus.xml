  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>PAUL, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to promote the faith of God's chosen and their knowledge of the truths of religion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of life eternal, which the God who never lies promised ages ago</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but in due time made known as his message through the proclamation with which I was entrusted by the commission of God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus, our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this reason I left you in Crete: to arrange the things that are lacking and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>wherever there is a man of irreproachable character, true to one woman, with believing children who are not charged with dissolute conduct and not unruly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop, as God's steward, must be above reproach, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not given to blows, not eager for base gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, just, holy, temperate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding to the trustworthy message which is according to the teaching, so that he may be able also to encourage others by wholesome teaching and to refute opposers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many insubordinate persons, foolish talkers and deceivers, especially those who are of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>who ought to be silenced, for they are upsetting whole house-holds, teaching what they should not, merely for the sake of base gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, base brutes, lazy gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving attention to Jewish myths and rules laid down by men who are turning away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure all things are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure. Even their minds and consciences are polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but by their deeds they disown him. They are detestable, disobedient, and worthless for any good work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>YOU must speak to them of the matters which should have a place in wholesome teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>Tell the older men to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>Tell the older women, in the same way, to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is noble,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may train the young women to be loving wives and loving mothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>self-controlled, pure, home-workers, kind, submissive to their own husbands, that God's message may not be slandered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Urge the younger men, in the same way, to practice self-control in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>Make yourself an example of good works, sincerity in teaching, dignified behavior</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>and wholesome talk that is above censure, that our opponents may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Tell slaves to be submissive to their own masters in all things and to try to please them, not answering back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not pilfering, but showing all kindly fidelity, so as to make the teaching about God our Savior seem beautiful in all respects.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us to renounce all irreligion and worldly passions and to live soberly, justly and piously in this present world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>waiting for the blessed hope, the glorious appearing of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all sin and purify us as his own people earnest in honorable work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Tell them these things, urge, convince with all authority; let no one slight you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>REMIND them to be submissive to ruling authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak abusively to no one, to be peaceable, to be fair, showing all gentleness toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves were once thoughtless, disobedient, astray, enslaved to passions and various pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness of our Savior, God, and his love to men appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>"not because of works that we had done in righteousness, but out of his own mercy he saved us through the bath of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that we might be declared righteous by his grace and become heirs with the hope of life eternal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>That is a trustworthy saying. I wish you to insist on these things so that those who have put their faith in God may give earnest attention to honorable work. These things are honorable and also useful to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish disputes and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law; for they are unprofitable and futile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>If a man is factious, after one or two warnings, have nothing more to do with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a one is perverted and goes on sinning though self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, try to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to pass the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Do your best in helping Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos forward on their journey so that they may lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>Our people too must learn to give attention to honorable work, so as to be able to meet pressing needs, that they may not be fruitless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me send you their greetings. Give our greetings to those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.</verse>
