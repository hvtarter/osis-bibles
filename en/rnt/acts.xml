  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>IN my first book, Theophilus, I told of all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>down to the day when, after giving commands, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>By many proofs he revealed himself to these men as still alive after his sufferings; for he was seen by them for forty days and spoke of things relating to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>Also while eating with them, he charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, "which," said he, "you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>When they came together, they asked him, "Master, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He said to them, "It is not yours to know the times and seasons which the Father has put under his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you will receive power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and to the ends of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>He said this and then, while they were looking on, he was taken up and a cloud lifted him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>They were gazing into the sky as he went, when suddenly two men in white robes were standing beside them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>and said, "Men of Galilee, why are you standing and looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way that you have seen him go into heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>They then returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Olive Orchard, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey distant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they came into the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter and John, and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All of these continued earnestly and unitedly in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren <note>the company numbered about a hundred and twenty</note> and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>"Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was numbered among us and received a share in this service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(This man bought a piece of land with the price of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst asunder and all his entrails were poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>It became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let his dwelling become desolate and let there be no one living in it,' and, 'His overseership let another take.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is needful, therefore, that of the men who have been with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>from the baptism of John down to the day that he was taken up from us \'97 that one of these should become a witness with us of his resurrection."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>So they put forward two, Joseph who is called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>In prayer they said, "O Lord, thou who knowest the hearts of all, show which one of these two thou has chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take the place in this service and apostleship which Judas deserted to go to his own place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they cast lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>DURING the course of the day of Pentecost they were all together in the same place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>when suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a strong rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>Then there appeared to them, as it were, tongues of flame distributing themselves, and one rested on each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in foreign tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of expression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>There were Jews living in Jerusalem, pious men from every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>When this sound was heard, the crowd came together and were astonished because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were amazed and, wondering, said, "Are not all these who are talking, Galilaean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How then does each of us hear them in his own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those who live in Mesopotamia, Judas and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia and Pamphilia, Egypt and the regions of Libya toward Cyrene, visitors from Rome, Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians \'97 we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all astonished and at a loss, one saying to another, "What does this mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Some scoffingly said, "They are full of sweet wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them: "Fellow Jews, and all of you who live in Jerusalem, understand this and listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>These are not drunk, as you assume, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>but this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>Yes, upon the slave men and slave girls that are mine I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>I will give portents in heaven above and signs on the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes \'97 that great and glorious day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And every one who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene was a man proved to be sent to you from God by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through him in the midst of you, as you yourselves know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>But when he had been delivered up according to the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed him through the hands of lawless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>But God freed him from the pangs of death and raised him up, since it was impossible that he should be held under the power of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says of him, 'I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is at my right hand so that I may not be cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, and my flesh still dwells in hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>that thou wilt not leave my soul to Hades and wilt not let thy holy one see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou makest me know the paths of life. Thou wilt fill me with joy in thy presence.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>"Brethren, allow me to say frankly to you regarding the patriarch David that he died and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>But being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him an oath to place a descendant of his body upon his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>he foreseeing spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, saying that he was not left to Hades and that his flesh did not see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus, God raised up, and all of us are witnesses of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>till I make your enemies your footstool.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Let all the house of Israel know surely that this Jesus, whom you crucified, God has made both Lord and Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Hearing this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "What shall we do, brethren?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all those who are far off, as many as the Lord your God may call."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>With many other words he bore witness and exhorted them, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Those who accepted his message were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>These gave constant attention to the teaching of the apostles and to the fellowship and the breaking of bread and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Awe came on every soul. Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All who believed had all things together in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They would sell their lands and goods and distribute to all as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Every day, continuing with one accord in the Temple courts and in breaking bread from house to house, they ate together in joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and having favor with all the people. The Lord added daily to their number those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>PETER and John were going up into the Temple courts at the hour of prayer, three o'clock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>when a man lame from his birth was being carried along. This man used to be placed every day near the gate of the Temple courts \'97 the one called the Beautiful Gate \'97 to beg of those who were entering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple courts, he begged to receive something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>But Peter fixing his eyes on him, along with John, said, "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>He gave attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have I will give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>Grasping his right hand he lifted him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>and he sprang up and stood and walked and entered the Temple court with them, walking and leaping and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking about and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and when they recognized that it was he who had sat begging at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple court, they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While he still clung to Peter and John, all the people ran crowding around them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade, greatly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>Peter, seeing the people, explained, "Fellow Israelites, why do you wonder at this, or why do you gaze so at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus whom you delivered up and disowned before Pilate when he had decided to release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You disowned the holy and righteous one and begged to have a murderer granted you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>You killed the Author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Of this we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And now by faith in his name this man whom you see and know has been made strong by his name, and the faith that is through him has given this man this perfect soundness before you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>"Now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>God in this way fulfilled what he had predicted through the mouths of all the prophets that his Christ should suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Therefore, repent and turn about, that your sins may be wiped away and the gracious face of the Lord may bring times of refreshing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and he may send Jesus Christ, long ago appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>but whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouths of his holy prophets of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>"Moses indeed said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brethren, as he raised me; listen to all that he may say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>It shall be that every person who does not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And all the prophets, Samuel and those who followed him, all who spoke, also foretold these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God established with your fathers when he said to Abraham, 'In your descendants all the families of the earth will be blessed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>To you first God, when he raised up his servant, sent him, to bless you by turning each one of you from his wicked ways."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>WHILE they were speaking to the people, the priests and the commandant of the Temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being offended because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They laid hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who had heard the message believed, and the number of the men grew to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>On the next day there was a gathering of their rulers and elders and scribes in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>with Annas the High Priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all who were of high priestly race.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>They placed the apostles in the midst and asked them, "By what power and in what name did you do this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we must answer to-day regarding a benefit done to an infirm man, by what name he has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead \'97 by this name, this man stands here before you sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which was despised by you the builders, and which has become the corner stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>Nor is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Observing the fearless outspokenness of Peter and John and perceiving that they were common, uneducated men, they were astonished, and they recognized them as former companions of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>Seeing the man who had been healed standing there with the apostles, they had nothing to say in opposition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>After ordering them to go out of the council, they conferred together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, "What shall we do to these men? For that a notable miracle has been done by them is plain to all who live in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But that it may not spread further among the people, let us sternly forbid them to speak any longer in this name to any one."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>So, calling them in, they commanded them absolutely not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>We, for our part, cannot refrain from saying what we have seen and heard."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>The Council after further threats set them at liberty, not finding any way to punish them on account of the people; for all were giving glory to God because of what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man upon whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>The apostles upon being released came to their friends and told them all that the high priests and the elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>They hearing it unitedly lifted up their prayer to God and said, "O Lord, thou who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who through the Holy Spirit by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say, 'Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ' \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>for truly in this city Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered against thy holy servant Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do all that thy hands and thy will had predetermined should take place \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>now, Lord, look upon their threats and enable thy servants to speak thy message with all fearlessness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>while thou dost stretch out thine hand for healing and while signs and wonders are done through the name of thy holy servant Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>After this prayer the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the message of God with courageous freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>The multitude of those who had believed was of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any part of his property was his own, but they had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>With great power the apostles continued to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>Nor was any one in need among them, for all who were owners of lands or houses would sell them and bring the money for what had been sold</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and lay it at the apostles' feet, and it would be distributed to each as he had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>Joseph, to whom the apostles had given the name Barnabas, which means "Son of Encouragement," a Levite born in Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>being the owner of a farm, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>BUT a man called Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and kept back a part of the price, with his wife's connivance, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While you had it, was it not yours? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>When Ananias heard these words he fell down and died. Great fear came upon all who heard these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>Then the young men arose and wrapped him in a shroud and carried him out and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>After an interval of about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for so much?" She answered, "Yes, for so much."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in and found her dead, and carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>Great awe came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. They were all with one purpose in Solomon's Colonnade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>Of the rest no one dared join them, but the people honored them highly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>Believers in the Lord were more and more being added, crowds both of men and of women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that they carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on couches and pallets with the hope that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>A crowd was coming too from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were troubled by impure spirits, and these were all being healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>On hearing this they went into the Temple courts about daybreak and began teaching. When the High Priest and his party arrived, they called together the Council and all the eldership of the children of Israel and sent to the jail to have the men brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But when the officers came there they did not find them in the prison. They returned and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>"We found the prison shut with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened we found no one inside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>On hearing these words the commandant of the Temple and the high priests were at a loss as to what this would grow into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Then some one came and told them, "The men whom you put in jail are standing in the Temple courts and teaching the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the commandant with his subordinates went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>They brought them in and made them stand before the Council. The High Priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>"Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this name? And here you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and want to bring this man's blood on us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Peter, answering for the apostles, said, "God must be obeyed rather than men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>This proposal pleased the whole body. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>These they presented before the apostles, who after prayer laid their hands upon them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But certain persons from what was called the synagogue of the Libyans and Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>They excited the people and the elders and the scribes, and coming suddenly upon Stephen they arrested him and led him to the Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>There they put forward false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases saying things against this holy place and the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But stand up and go into the city and it will be told you what you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>The men who were on the road with him stood struck dumb, hearing the voice, but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Saul rose from the earth and opened his eyes, but he could see nothing. Taking him by the hand they led him into Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>and he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>There was in Damascus a certain disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." He answered, "Here I am, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight street, and ask in the house of Judas for a man named Saul from Tarsus. He is now in prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him in order that he may receive his sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard about this man from many people \'97 how many wicked things he has done to thy holy ones in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he has authority from the high priests to bind all who call upon thy name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, "Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before nations and kings and the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>Ananias went and entered the house and put his hands on Saul, and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me \'97 Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming \'97 that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Immediately scales seemed to fall from his eyes and he could see, and he arose and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>and after taking food he regained his strength. Saul passed some days with the disciples who were in Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>and at once he began to proclaim in the synagogues that Jesus was the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is not this the man who in Jerusalem persecuted those who call on this name, and who came here for the very purpose of binding and taking them to the high priests?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul grew stronger and put to confusion the Jews who lived at Damascus, as he proved that this man was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>When a number of days had passed, the Jews plotted to put him out of the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but this became known to Saul. They watched the gates day and night to seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>But the disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When Saul reached Jerusalem, he tried to attach himself to the disciples, but all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>After that Saul was with them in Jerusalem, going out and in</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and speaking freely in the name of the Lord. He frequently spoke and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews. But they kept trying to put him out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When the brethren learned of it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>So the church had peace throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and was built up, and advancing in the reverence of the Lord and by the encouragement of the Holy Spirit grew continually in numbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>It happened that Peter, while passing about among all the holy, came down also to those who were dwelling at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>He found there a man named Aeneas who had been for eight years lying on a pallet, for he was a paralytic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Rise up and make your bed." Immediately he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>All who were living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha <note>in Greek Dorcas, Gazelle</note>. She abounded in good works and acts of kindness which she was accustomed to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>It happened at that time that she fell sick and died. They bathed her and laid her out in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Since Lydda was near to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him begging him, "Do not delay to come on down to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>Peter arose and went along with them. On his arrival they took him up to the room. All of the widows came around him wailing and showing the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter sent them all out and kneeling down he prayed. Then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>Giving her his hand he raised her to her feet. Then calling the holy and the widows he presented her to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>This became known through all Joppa and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>Peter stayed in Joppa many days with a man named Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>THERE was in Caesarea a man named Cornelius, a centurion in the battalion called the Italian cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a pious man, reverencing God with all his household, doing many acts of charity to the people and praying to God constantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About three o'clock one afternoon he saw plainly in a vision an angel come in and say to him, "Cornelius."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>He gazed at him in alarm and asked, "What is it, my Lord?" The angel said to him, "Your prayers and your gifts of charity have come up as an evidence before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Now send men to Joppa and ask for a man named Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is the guest of a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel who had been speaking to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier of those who were attached to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and, after explaining everything to them, sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the next day, while they were on the road and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray. It was about noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He began to feel hungry and wished to eat. While they were preparing food, he fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and saw the heavens opened and something descending like a great sheet being let down to the ground by the four corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In it were all kinds of fourfooted animals and reptiles and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>Then a voice came to him, "Rise, Peter, kill and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unclean or impure."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>A second time the voice came to him, "What God has cleansed you must not think unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened a third time, and then immediately the sheet was taken up into the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Peter was thinking this over and was at a loss what the vision meant. Just then the men who had been sent by Cornelius, after inquiring for the house of Simon, came to the door</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and called to know whether Simon called Peter was a guest there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>While Peter was debating with himself about the vision, the Spirit said, "Here are two men looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Rise and go down and go with them without misgivings, for I have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Peter went down and said to the men, "Here I am \'97 the man you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to listen to your words."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Then he invited them in and entertained them. The next day Peter arose and went away with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had assembled his relatives and his close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him and falling at his feet did him reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself also am a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>Conversing with him Peter entered the house and found many people assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He said to them, "You understand that it is against our Law for a Jew to be closely associated with a Gentile or to visit him. But God has taught me not to call any person common or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Therefore when I was sent for I came without making any objection. So now I ask, For what reason have you sent for me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius said, "Four days ago, at this hour, I was offering the three o'clock prayer in my house, when suddenly a man stood before me in shining dress</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts of charity have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter. He is a guest in the house of Simon a tanner near the sea'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately I sent to you and you have done well in coming. Now here we all are in God's presence to hear all that the Lord has commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Peter opened his mouth and said, "Truly I understand that God is not partial,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation whoever reverences him and lives righteously is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>As to the message which he sent to the children of Israel telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ \'97 who is Lord of all \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>you know the story that spread through all Judaea. It began in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were harassed by the Devil, for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>We are witnesses of all that he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a cross and so killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>But God raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses previously chosen by God, namely, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>God commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that he is the divinely appointed Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>All of the prophets testify to this, that every one who believes in him obtains forgiveness of sins through his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to his message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>All the believers who were of the circumcision who had come along with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>for they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>"Can any one forbid water for the baptism of these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain there a few days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>THE apostles and the brethren throughout Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, "You went into the houses of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter began and explained consecutively all that had happened. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>"I was in the city of Joppa and was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something like a great sheet was descending, lowered from heaven by the four corners, and it came to where I was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>I looked at it attentively and saw the fourfooted animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>Then I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>I said, 'By no means, Lord, for never has anything common or unclean entered my mouth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>The voice spoke again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not think common.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This happened three times and then everything was drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>Immediately three men came to the house in which we were. They had been sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>The Spirit directed me to go with them without any questioning. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>He related to us how he had seen in his house an angel who stood and said, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>He will speak to you words by which you and your whole household will be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>When I began speaking the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as on us at the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>and I remembered the words of the Lord how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God gave to them the same gift that he gave to us on believing in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could oppose God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>On hearing this they ceased their criticism and gave glory to God, saying, "Then even to the Gentiles God has granted the change of heart that leads to life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Those who were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message to none but Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, and they on reaching Antioch spoke also to the Greeks, telling them the good news of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>Word came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem regarding these men, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>When he arrived and saw the grace of God he was delighted, and he encouraged all to be firmly faithful to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. A considerable number were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Barnabas went away to Tarsus to look up Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and upon finding him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large company, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called "Christians."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>In those days some prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them named Agabus arose and foretold through the Holy Spirit that a great famine was going to occur over all the inhabited world. <note>It happened in the time of Claudius.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples determined, each according to his means, to send something for the help of the brethren who were living in Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>This they did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>ABOUT that time King Herod laid hands on some members of the church in order to maltreat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>He killed James the brother of John with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>Seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>He seized him and put him in prison, committing him to four guards of four soldiers each for safe keeping, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was under guard in the prison. But prayer was continually made by the church to God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>On the very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains, and guards before the door were watching the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>Suddenly an angel of the Lord was there. Light shone in the cell. Striking Peter's side he woke him, saying, "Rise up quickly." His chains fell off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and your sandals." Peter did so. The angel said to him, "Throw your cloak around you and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>Peter came out and followed along, not knowing whether what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>After passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This opened for them of its own accord and they went out and went along one street. Then suddenly the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>So understanding the situation, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John called Mark, where a number were assembled and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>When Peter knocked at the door of the entry, a girl named Rhoda came to listen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>and when she recognized Peter's voice, without opening the door, she ran for joy and told them that Peter was standing at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said to her, "You are insane." But she was positive that it was so. They said, "It is his angel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door and saw him they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>He motioned to them with his hand to be silent, and explained to them how the Lord had delivered him out of the prison, and he said, "Tell this to James and the brethren." Then he left and went to a different place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>When day came there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Herod searched for him, but not finding him he closely questioned the guards and ordered them to be led away to execution. Then he went down from Jerusalem to Caesarea and stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Herod had a bitter feud with the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came to him with one mind, and having won over Blastus, the King's chamberlain, they begged for peace, because their country depended for its food supply on the King's country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>On an appointed day Herod in his royal robes sat on a platform and made an address to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people shouted, "It is a god's voice, not a man's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But God's message grew and spread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>Barnabas and Saul after fulfilling their mission returned from Jerusalem, bringing along with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>THERE were in Antioch among the members of the church several prophets and teachers \'97 Barnabas, and Symeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen <note>a companion in childhood of Prince Herod</note> and Saul.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, after fasting and praying and laying their hands upon them, they sent them off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Sent out in this way by the Holy Spirit, Barnabas and Saul went down to Seleucia and from there sailed for Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>Arriving at Salamis they announced God's message in the synagogues of the Jews. They had John as their assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>After passing through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a Jewish magician and false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was in the company of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The Proconsul invited in Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear God's message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the magician <note>for that is the translation of his name</note> opposed them, endeavoring to turn the Proconsul away from the faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, "You who are full of every kind of fraud, you son of the Devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you never stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now the hand of the Lord is upon you and you will be blind for a time, unable to see the sun." Immediately a dimness and darkness fell on him, and he went about seeking for people to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>The message of the Lord was carried abroad through the whole country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up the pious women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their boundaries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Therefore the apostles spent considerable time speaking freely and fearlessly in reliance upon the Lord, who bore witness to his gracious message by permitting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>The people of the city became divided; some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>the apostles learned of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>and there they went on telling the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>In Lystra there was a man sitting who was powerless in his feet. He had been lame from his mother's womb and never had walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>He was listening to Paul as he was speaking. Paul fixed his eyes on him, and, seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have taken human form and come down to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They called Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the principal speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, followed by the crowds, and intended to offer sacrifice.</verse>

We are bringing you the good news that you are to turn from these foolish things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all things that are in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In past generations he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>After telling the message in Perga, they came down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they sailed for Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had now completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>Upon their arrival they assembled the church and narrated all that God, working with them, had done, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So they were sent on by the church and passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles, which caused great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>On their arrival in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they narrated all that God, working with them, had done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>The apostles and elders met to confer about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>After there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in early days God chose among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of good news and should believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>The whole assembly remained silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>When they ceased speaking, James said, "Brethren, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Symeon has told how first God graciously visited the Gentiles and took a people for his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They wrote and sent by their hands the following letter: "The Apostles and the Brethren who are elders, to the Brethren from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: Greeting.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will tell you orally the same things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brethren in every city in which we made known the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas wished to take along John who was called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul did not approve of taking him along, since he had left them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them into the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>Such a difference of feeling resulted that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>Paul selected Silas and left, after being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>They went through Syria and Cilicia strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>THEY came to Derbe and Lystra. At Lystra there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was a believer, and of a Greek father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>He had a good reputation among the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wished to have Timothy go with him. So he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. For they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>Thus they traveled through the cities and delivered to the disciples for observance the rules that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches grew firmer in faith and increased in numbers from day to day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>They went through Phrygia and the Galatian country, the Holy Spirit having prevented their speaking the message in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>Upon reaching Mysia they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the spirit of Jesus did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>Passing by Mysia they came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>There a vision appeared to Paul in the night \'97 a Macedonian man was standing and begging him saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>After Paul had seen the vision, we at once tried to go out to Macedonia, inferring that God had called on us to tell the good news to the people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Sailing away from Troas we made a straight run to Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>From there we went to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia and is a Roman colony. We remained in that city for a number of days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath day we went outside of the gate to a place on the riverside where it was customary to go for prayer, and we sat down and talked with the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>One woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple, from the city of Thyatira, who reverenced God, was listening. God opened her heart to receive what was said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>When she had been baptized along with her household, she begged us, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay," and she insisted on our doing so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>It so happened that as we were going to the place of prayer a certain slave girl who had a spirit of divination met us. She was bringing great gain to her masters by divining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She followed Paul and us and kept calling out, "These men are servants of God Most High, and they are teaching you the way of salvation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>This she kept doing for many days. Paul was annoyed, and turning he said to the spirit, "I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her," and it came out at that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the authorities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>Bringing them in, they said to the magistrates, "These men, who are Jews, are disturbing our city</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>The crowd joined in the attack upon them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>After laying many stripes upon them they cast them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>He on receiving such an order thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet secure in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>The jailer, waking from sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul said with a loud voice, "Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>Calling for a light he sprang in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and led them out and said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, and your household,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>and they told the message of God to him and to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>He took them at that hour of the night and washed their stripes. Then he was baptized, he and all of his household, immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>He brought them into his house and spread the table for them, and rejoiced with his whole family because he had believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>When morning came the magistrates sent their orderlies to say, "Set those men at liberty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The jailer told this order to Paul, "The magistrates have sent to have you set at liberty. Now go out and proceed on your journey in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, "After beating us publicly and without a trial, although we are Romans, they cast us into prison. And are they now sending us out secretly? No, let them come themselves and lead us out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The orderlies reported these words to the magistrates. When they heard that they were Romans they were alarmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>and came and begged them, and after leading them out requested them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>They came out of the prison and went into Lydia's house, and after seeing and encouraging the brethren they departed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>AFTER passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>According to Paul's custom he went in to meet with them, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>explaining and showing that it was necessary that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, "Jesus of whom I am telling you is the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of them were persuaded and attached themselves to Paul and Silas \'97 a large number of the pious Greeks and not a few of the leading women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews became excited and, taking with them some of the base loafers from the market-place, they made a mob and threw the city into confusion. They attacked the house of Jason and tried to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>Not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the magistrates, shouting, "These men who have upset the world have now come here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>Jason has received them. They all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is a different king \'97 Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>Both the crowd and the magistrates were disturbed on hearing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>So they took security from Jason and the rest and then dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>The brethren immediately sent off Paul and Silas in the night to Beraea. They on arrival went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These people were nobler than those in Thessalonica. They welcomed the message with all readiness and examined the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Consequently many of them believed, and also not a few Greeks; women of high standing and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>When the Jews of Thessalonica learned that God's message had been proclaimed by Paul also in Beraea, they came there agitating and disturbing the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>At once then the brethren sent away Paul to go down to the sea coast. Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>Those who were conducting Paul took him as far as Athens, and, after receiving a letter to Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he looked upon the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He often debated in the synagogue with the Jews and pious persons, and in the market-place every day with whoever happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, "What can this idle talker mean?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he was telling the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>They took him and led him up on to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new doctrine that you are speaking of is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you are bringing strange and surprising things to our ears. We wish to know what these things are."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>For all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing else than in telling or hearing something newer than the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Paul took his stand in the midst of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens, I see that you are in every way unusually reverential to the gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For in passing about and contemplating your sacred objects I came upon an altar on which was inscribed, 'To an unknown God.' What you are worshiping in ignorance \'97 that I am making known to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>"The God who made the world and all the things that are in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything. For he gives to all life and breath and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out the appointed times and the boundaries of their abodes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they might seek for God, if they could feel after him and find him, though, indeed, he is not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live and move and are; as some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are his offspring.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that deity is like gold or silver or stone, a thing carved by man's art and thought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to change,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>since he has set a day in which he will soon judge the world in justice by the man whom he has appointed, and of whom he has given evidence to all men by raising him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some sneered; others said, "We will hear you again about this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul went out from the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But certain men attached themselves to him and believed. Among them was Dionysius the Areopagite, and there was a woman named Damaris and several other persons.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>AFTER this Paul left Athens and came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>There he found a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus but recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. Paul visited these people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because he was of the same trade stayed with them and they worked together; for by trade they were tent-makers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>But in the synagogue every Sabbath he reasoned and endeavored to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was absorbed by the message, bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>When they resisted and spoke profane words, he rent his garments and said to them, "Your blood is on your own heads. I am clear, and from now on I am going to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he changed over from there and came into the house of a man named Titus Justus, who reverenced God. His house was next to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Crispus, the synagogue Director, believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>The Lord spoke in the night by a vision to Paul, "Do not fear, but speak and be not silent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with you and no one shall attack and harm you, for I have many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So he stayed a year and six months, teaching among them the message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>While Gallio was Proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind made an attack on Paul and brought him before the court,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, "This man is inducing men to worship God in a way contrary to law."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it was some crime or wicked knavery, O you Jews, I would have reasonable patience with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it is a dispute about doctrine and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>and he drove them from before the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then they laid hold of Sosthenes, the synagogue Director, and beat him right in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio cared for none of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Paul remained a number of days more. Then after taking leave of the brethren he sailed away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila went with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>They came to Ephesus and Paul left his companions there. He himself went into the synagogue and debated with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>Although they begged him to stay longer, he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but took his leave, saying, "I will return to you again, God willing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>From Ephesus he put to sea and came to Caesarea. Then he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, and from there returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After spending some time there he set out and went through the Galatian country and Phrygia, place by place, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>A certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, a learned man, had come to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He was strong in knowledge of the Scriptures and had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and, being very earnest in spirit, was teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew no baptism but John's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>This man began to speak fearlessly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>As he wished to cross over to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. So he went and greatly helped those who had believed through grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he powerfully and publicly refuted the Jews, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>WHILE Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "On the contrary, we did not even hear that there was a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He said, "How then were you baptized?" They said, "With John's baptism."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of a change of heart, telling the people to believe in one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>On hearing that, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>and when Paul laid his hands on them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>There were about twelve of these men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>For three months Paul went into the synagogue and spoke fearlessly, arguing persuasively regarding the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>When some were hardened and would not believe and spoke evil of the Way before the congregation, he departed from them and took away his disciples and discussed daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the message of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>Through the hands of Paul, God did miracles of no ordinary kind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his body were carried to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Then some of the wandering Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>and the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on them and overpowered both of them, and so belabored them that they fled from that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>This became known to all who were living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and awe fell on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in high honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many of those who had become believers came confessing and telling of their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>A number of those who had practiced magic brought their books and burned them before all. Adding up the prices of them they found the total to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Thus vigorously the Lord's message grew and strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>When these things had been accomplished Paul took it in mind to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there I must see Rome also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>He sent on into Macedonia two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained awhile in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>At that time there arose no small commotion about the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, a maker of silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing to the artisans no small gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>He gathered these and the workmen employed about such things and said, "Men, you know that from this business we get our wealth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but also throughout almost all Asia this Paul has persuaded and drawn away a large number, saying that hand-made gods are not gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>Not only is this trade of ours in danger of coming into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is in danger of being held of no account, and she whom now all Asia and the wide world worship will be deposed from her majesty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>Upon hearing this, they became full of anger and shouted, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed with one mind into the theater, having gotten hold of Gaius and Aristarchus, fellow travelers of Paul's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>When Paul wished to go in and face the people the disciples would not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>Some of the city officials who were his friends sent to him and begged him not to expose himself in the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the most did not know why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>Some of the crowd fixed on Alexander, since the Jews were putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand and wished to make a defense before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, there arose one shout from all for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>Then the City Clerk quieted the crowd and said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there of all men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of her image which fell down from Zeus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Since these things are indisputable, you ought to be calm and do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought here these men who are not robbers of temples nor defamers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If Demetrius and the artisans with him have a charge against any one, there are court days and there are proconsuls; let the parties state their cases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>If you are seeking anything further, it shall be settled in a lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we are in danger of being called in question regarding to-day's mob, and we shall not be able to give a reason for this tumult."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>By saying this he dissolved the gathering.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>WHEN the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and, after encouraging them, he bade them farewell and left to proceed to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>Passing through those parts and encouraging them by many addresses, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>There he spent three months. When a plot was formed against him by the Jews as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>There were in company with him Sopater of Beraea, the son of Pyrrhus, and of the Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy, and from Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These went on and were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>After the Days of Unleavened Bread we sailed from Philippi and came to them in Troas in five days. There we spent seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week, when we all were assembled to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, being about to leave in the morning, and he extended his address until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>There were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>A certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, was overcome with deep sleep while Paul went on discoursing. At last overpowered by sleep he fell from the third story and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul went down and threw himself on him and embraced him and said, "Do not make a noisy wailing; for his life is still in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then he went up and broke bread and ate and talked on till daybreak and so departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>They brought the boy living, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>We went in advance to the ship and sailed for Assos, intending to take on Paul there, for so he had arranged, intending to come himself by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>So when he joined us at Assos, we took him aboard and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>From there we sailed next day and arrived off Chios. The next day we came to Samos, and on the following day to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>When they came to him, he said to them, "You know how I have lived among you the whole time since the first day I set foot in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews \'97</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I do not hold my life as of any account if only I may finish my race and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of the grace of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>In all things I showed you that so laboring we ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>After saying this he kneeled with them all and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>All wept aloud, and falling on Paul's neck they kissed him affectionately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>grieving especially because he had said that they would never see his face again; and they escorted him to the ship.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take these men and go through purification with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that what they have heard about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself walk in obedience to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>"But as to the Gentiles that have believed, we have, after consideration, sent our decision that they shall guard themselves against what has been sacrificed to idols, and against blood, and against what has been strangled, and against unchastity."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul on the next day took the men, and, after purifying himself, entered the Temple courts, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification \'97 the time until a sacrifice would have been offered for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>But when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the Temple courts, and stirred up all the crowd and laid their hands on Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>shouting, "Men of Israel, help. This is the man who teaches everybody everywhere against our people and the Law and this place, and moreover, he has brought Greeks into the Temple courts and has desecrated this holy place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul, and they thought that he had brought him into the Temple courts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>The whole city was excited and the people rushed together. Seizing Paul, they drew him out of the Temple courts, and immediately the gates were closed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the Tribune of the battalion that all Jerusalem was in commotion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the people. They, on seeing the Tribune and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the Tribune coming up arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some called out one thing and some another in the crowd. Not being able to find out anything for certain on account of the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When Paul got upon the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the mob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the crowd of people was following and shouting, "Kill him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>As he was about to enter the barracks Paul said to the Tribune, "May I say something to you?" He replied, "Can you speak Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Are you then not the Egyptian who some time ago raised a sedition and led off four thousand assassins into the desert?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me talk to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>He gave him leave, and Paul standing on the stairs motioned with his hand to the people. There was a great silence, and, speaking loudly in Hebrew, Paul said:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>"BRETHREN and Fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>Hearing him speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more quiet. He continued:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel in exact knowledge of our ancestral Law, and I was zealous for God as you all are to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as the High Priest and all the eldership can testify for me. From them I received letters to the brethren and was journeying to Damascus in order to bring back in chains to Jerusalem for punishment those who had gone there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>It happened that as I was journeying and nearing Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light flashed from heaven around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>I asked, 'Who is speaking?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>My companions saw the light, but did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that it has been appointed for you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>Since I could not see, owing to the brightness of that light, my companions led me by the hand, and so I entered Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>"Then a man named Ananias, a strict observer of the Law and highly esteemed by all the Jews who lived there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to see me and stood by me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight,' and I, at that moment, could see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>He said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>for you shall be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why delay? Rise, be baptized and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>"After I had returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the Temple courts, I fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw Jesus saying to me, 'Hasten and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>But I said, 'Lord, they know that I used to imprison and beat from synagogue to synagogue those who believe in thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed I myself was standing by and approving it, and taking care of the cloaks of those who were putting him to death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>But he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to Gentiles.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>They listened up to this point, but now they broke out, shouting, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought never to have lived!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>While they were shouting and rending their garments and throwing dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the Tribune ordered him to be led into the barracks and directed that he should be examined with the lash, so that he might know for what crime they were shouting so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the Centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and without a trial?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>On hearing that, the Centurion went to the Tribune and told him," What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the Tribune came to him and said, "Tell me; are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>The Tribune said, "I obtained this citizenship by paying a great sum of money." Paul said, "But I was born to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>At once those who were about to examine him went away from him, and the Tribune was alarmed when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had chained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>On the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, the Tribune loosed Paul and ordered the high priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and stood him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>PAUL fixed his eyes on the Council and said, "Brethren, I have conducted myself with all good conscience toward God up to this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>The High Priest Ananias told those who stood near him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, "God will soon strike you, you whitewashed wall. Are you sitting to judge me by the Law and yet violating the Law by ordering me to be struck?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>Those who stood by said, "Are you insulting God's High Priest?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was High Priest. It is written, 'Thou shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Then Paul, perceiving that one party was of Sadducees and the other of Pharisees, shouted out in the Council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being tried for the hope of the resurrection of the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>On his saying this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly became divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection nor any angel or spirit, but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>So a great uproar arose, and some of the scribes of the party of the Pharisees arose and contended, saying, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>When the strife was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down and take him from the midst of them and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>On the following night the Lord stood beside Paul and said, "Courage! As you have witnessed for me in Jerusalem, so you must witness in Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>When it was day, the Jews made a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty who had taken this oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They came to the high priests and elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore you and the Council must ask the Tribune to bring him down to you, as if you were going to inquire more exactly about him, and we, before he comes near, will be ready to put him out of the way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But the son of Paul's sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Paul called to him one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>He took him and led him to the Tribune and said, "Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The Tribune took him by the hand and led him aside and asked, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to-morrow to the Council to inquire something more exactly about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not yield to them, for more than forty men of them are lying in ambush, and they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, expecting a promise from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>The Tribune dismissed the young man after charging him; "Tell no one that you have revealed this to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>Then calling to him two of the centurions he said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at nine o'clock to-night."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>They were to provide animals for Paul to ride and take him safely to Felix the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>He wrote a letter in the following form:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>"Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Governor Felix: greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came up with soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>Wishing to find what was the charge that they had against him I took him down to their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found him accused regarding disputed questions of their law, but of nothing deserving of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>Information has come to me that there will be a plot against the man, and so I am sending him at once to you, and I have commanded his accusers to state their case against him before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers, according to their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>On the next day they let the horsemen go on with him, but they themselves returned to the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>The horsemen came on to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, and also placed Paul before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>He read the letter and asked of what province he was, and learned that he was from Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>Then he said, "I will hear what you have to say when your accusers also arrive." He gave orders that Paul should be guarded in Herod's castle.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>AFTER five days the High Priest Ananias came down with certain elders and an advocate named Tertullus, and they spoke against Paul to the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>When Paul had been called in, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Because we enjoy great peace through your administration and reforms are taking place for this nation through your prudence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we accept it always and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But not to burden you further, I beg you in your fairness to hear us briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>We have found this man a pest and an inciter of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>He even tried to desecrate the Temple courts, but we overpowered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>You yourself can examine him and learn from him as to all these things of which we are accusing him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews joined in the attack upon him, affirming that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Paul answered, when the Governor nodded to him to speak, "Because I know that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I feel courage in defending myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>You can ascertain that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>Neither did they find me discussing with any one in the Temple courts nor making any tumultuous gatherings in the synagogues nor anywhere in the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>nor can they bring you proofs of their accusations against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>"This I do confess to you, that in the Way which they call a heresy I worship the God of our fathers, believing all things that are according to the Law and what is written in the Prophets</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>and having the hope in God which they themselves also accept \'97 that there will be a resurrection both of the just and of the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And in this I take pains, to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>"After many years I came to my nation to make gifts of charity and offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>They found me in the Temple thus occupied and purified, with no crowd or noise \'97 but there were some Jews from Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to have been here before you to present their accusations if they had anything against me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Council;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it was in the single assertion that I shouted as I stood among them, 'It is regarding the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial to-day before you!' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>Felix adjourned the case, since he was well informed regarding the Way, saying, "When Lysias the Tribune comes down, I will inquire into your matters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He gave orders to the Centurion to guard him, but to let him have indulgence, and not to hinder any of his friends from attending to his wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him regarding faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>While Paul was reasoning about righteousness and self-discipline and the judgment that is to come, Felix became alarmed and said," Go for the present. When I find a convenient time I will send for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>At the same time he was in hopes that money would be given him by Paul and therefore he used to send for him more frequently and converse with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But at the end of two years Felix received Porcius Festus as a successor, and, wishing to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in chains.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>FESTUS entered the province and after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>There the high priests and the leaders of the Jews spoke to him against Paul</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>and begged as a favor that he would send for him to Jerusalem, intending to have an ambush and kill him on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered that Paul was being kept in Caesarea and that he himself was going back very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>"Let those of you who can," he said, "go down with me, and, if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring their charges against him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>After spending not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea and on the next day took his seat on the judge's bench and ordered Paul to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he had come in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges, which they were unable to prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while Paul claimed in his own defense, "Neither against the Jewish Law nor against the Temple courts nor against Caesar, have I committed any wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Festus, wishing to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried for this before me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's bar, where I ought to be tried. I have not harmed any Jews in anything, as you very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If I am in the wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not ask not to die. But if there is nothing in the accusations of these men, no one has the power to give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, after talking with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>When some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>As they were spending a good many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King. "There is a man here," he said, "who was left a prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>against whom when I was in Jerusalem the high priests and the elders of the Jews had much to say, asking to have him condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any person for punishment before the accused has his accusers face to face and has opportunity for defense against the charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>"So they came along down here and, without making any delay, on the very next day I took my seat on the judge's bench and ordered the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>When his accusers arose, they brought no charge of such crimes as I was expecting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but they had some disputes with him about their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>Being at a loss about a question of this kind, I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on the charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "To-morrow," he replied, "you shall hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>So on the next day Agrippa came and Bernice with much display, and they entered the auditorium with the military tribunes and the principal men of the city, and at Festus' command Paul was led in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Festus said, "King Agrippa and all present here with us, you see this man against whom all the multitude of the Jews pleaded with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I understood that he had done nothing worthy of death, and when he himself had appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that after an examination I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me unreasonable in sending a prisoner not to specify the charges against him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>AGRIPPA said to Paul, "You are at liberty to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>"In regard to all of the things of which I am accused by Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am to make my defense to-day before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>since you are especially expert in all Jewish customs and questions. Therefore I pray you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>"My life from boyhood, which was from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all Jews know.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand to be tried for the hope of the promise which God made to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which our twelve tribes devotedly serving God night and day hope to attain. For this hope I am accused by the Jews, O King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>"Why do all of you consider it incredible if God raises dead men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I thought with myself that I ought to do much against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>And I did it in Jerusalem and many holy men I shut up in prison, getting authority from the high priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>In all the synagogues and often I punished them and compelled them to say profane words. Being excessively mad against them, I pursued them even to foreign cities.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>about midday, on the road, I saw, O King, a light above the brightness of the sun shining from heaven around me and my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>We all fell to the ground and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>I said, 'Who is speaking?' He said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But rise and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you a servant and a witness of the times you have seen me and of the times I shall appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>I will deliver you from your people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among those who are made holy by faith in me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>After that, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but first to the people in Damascus and then to the people of Jerusalem and through all the land of Judaea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God and do deeds suitable for a change of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>"For this reason Jews seized me in the Temple courts and tried to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>But obtaining help from God I have continued until this day witnessing to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would be,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Christ would suffer and that he first, by rising from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>While Paul was thus defending himself, Festus said loudly, "You are raving, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>"I am not insane," he said, "most noble Festus, but am uttering words of truth and soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>The King knows about this, and to him I speak with perfect frankness, for I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his attention, for this has not been done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Agrippa said to Paul, "With little effort you are persuading me to become a Christian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Paul said, "I would to God that whether with little or with much, not only you, but all who hear me this day, would become such as I am \'97 except for these chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Then the King rose and the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and after withdrawing they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to Caesar."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>WHEN it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they committed Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of an imperial battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>Going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the places along the coast of Asia we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>On the next day we reached Sidon, where Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to see his friends and enjoy their attentions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>After crossing the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>By slow sailing for many days we with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then the wind being against us, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and with difficulty got past it and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>When much time had passed and sailing was now dangerous because it was already after the Fast, Paul addressed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>"Men," he said, "I see that the voyage is going to be rough and with much loss not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the Centurion listened more to the sailing master and the ship owner than to what Paul said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>and as the harbor was not convenient to winter in, the majority adopted the purpose of sailing away on the chance of being able to reach Phoenix and winter there. Phoenix is a harbor of Crete facing the southwest and the northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>When the south wind blew softly, thinking that they had secured their purpose, they weighed anchor and coasted along Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But before long a hurricane, such as is called Euraquilo, swept down off the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>When the ship was caught and unable to keep her head to the wind, we gave up and let her drive before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>Running under the lee of an island called Cauda, we contrived with difficulty to secure the small boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>When we had got it in, we used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing that we might get stranded on the Syrtis, they lowered the sail and so drifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>So violently were we battered by the storm that on the next day they lightened the ship</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and on the third day with their own hands they threw over the ship's tackle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>When for many days neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us, at last all hope of our being saved was being taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>After they had long gone without food, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, "Men, you ought to have listened to me and not to have sailed away from Crete and met this rough experience and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>But now I beg you to have courage, for there will be no loss of life of any of you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For this night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>and said, 'Never fear, Paul! You must stand before Caesar. And now God has granted to you all the men who are sailing with you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>So cheer up, men. For I trust in God that it will be as it has been told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>We must, however, run on to a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>When the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven through the Adriatic, about midnight the sailors surmised that land was getting near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>Sounding they found twenty fathoms, and after a little they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then fearing that they might run into rocky places, they cast out four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>The sailors were intent on escaping from the ship and lowered the small boat into the sea under the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>but Paul said to the Centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the small boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>Until day began to dawn, Paul kept urging all to take food. He said, "To-day is the fourteenth day that you have been on the watch fasting, not taking anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore, I beg you, take some food. For this is for your safety. Not a hair of the head of any one of you is going to perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>Saying this he took a loaf and gave thanks to God before all and broke it and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>Then all cheered up and themselves took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>We in the ship were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>After eating heartily, they lightened the ship, throwing over the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When day came they did not recognize the land, but they observed a bay with a beach. Into this they planned to run the ship if they could.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>So abandoning the anchors they left them in the sea; at the same time loosening the bands of the steering oars and raising the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling into a place where there were cross-currents they ran the ship aground. The bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was breaking up under the violence of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers' advice was to kill the prisoners for fear that some one of them might swim out and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the Centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them back from their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to shore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest to follow, some on boards and some on things from the ship. And so all got safe to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>WHEN we were safe ashore, we found that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The foreign people showed us uncommon kindness. For they kindled a fire and welcomed us all because of the rain that was falling and the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and laid it on the fire, when a snake came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped the sea, Justice does not permit to live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>He however shook off the creature into the fire and felt no harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>They kept watching to see him swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after watching a long time and seeing nothing amiss happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>In the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us and for three days hospitably entertained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this happened, the rest in the island who had infirmities came also and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They bestowed many honors on us and when we sailed they put on board supplies for our needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>After three months we sailed in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was from Alexandria and her figure-head was the Twin Brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>Landing at Syracuse we remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From there we came around and got to Rhegium. After one day there, a south wind sprang up and we came on the second day to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>Here we found brethren and were begged by them to stay seven days. And so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>From there the brethren, when they got news of us, came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we reached Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>After three days he invited the leading men among the Jews, and when they had assembled, he said to them, "Brethren, although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was delivered up as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>They, after investigating my case, wished to set me free because I had done nothing deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have any charge to bring against my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this reason I have invited you to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I have this chain around me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They said to him, "We on our part have received no letters about you from Judaea nor has any one of the brethren come and reported or spoken anything evil of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>We think it well to hear from you what your views are; for as to this sect we know that it is everywhere spoken against."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>They appointed a day for him and many came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying to the kingdom of God, trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from early morning until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some were persuaded by what he said and some did not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>They dispersed, disagreeing with one another, after Paul had said one word, "Well said the Holy Spirit through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>'Go to this people and say, You will hear plainly but you will not understand, and you will see plainly but you will not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the heart of this people has grown fat and with their ears they are hard of hearing and their eyes they have shut, so that they may never see with their eyes nor hear with their ears nor understand with their heart and repent, so that I may heal them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Therefore be it known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They will listen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>Paul remained two whole years in his own rented lodging and received all who came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all freedom of speech, unhindered.</verse>
