  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>THE Beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>It is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight' ";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>just so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching the baptism of a change of heart for forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>All the land of Judaea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John's clothes were of camel's hair and he had a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He proclaimed, "One is coming after me who is more powerful than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop and loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>Immediately as he was coming up from the water he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And there was a voice from the heavens, "Thou art my Son, my Beloved; in thee I am well pleased."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Immediately the spirit impelled him to go out into the wild lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wild lands forty days, tempted by Satan. There he was among the wild beasts, but angels waited upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After John had been betrayed, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, "The time has been completed and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>As he passed along by the lake of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>They immediately left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, mending their net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>They came into Capernaum. Immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>The people were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as if he had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>There was in their synagogue a man wider the power of an impure spirit, and he immediately cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>"What have you to do with us, Nazarene Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are \'97 the Holy one of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus reproved him and said, "Be still, and come out of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>Then the impure spirit convulsed him, and screamed loudly and came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>They were all amazed so that they discussed together, "What is this? A new powerful teaching! He commands even the impure spirits and they obey him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>So reports about him immediately spread everywhere through the whole region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>The mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with fever. Immediately they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>He came to her, and took her by the hand and lifted her up. The fever left her and she waited on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>When evening came and the sun had set, they brought to him all the sick and those who were afflicted with demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole city was gathered before the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons, not allowing the demons to talk, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>Early in the morning, while it was still night, he rose and went out, and went away into a solitary place and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Simon and his companions searched for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and when they found him they said to him, "All are looking for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>But he said to them, "Let us go somewhere else among the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there too; for it was for this purpose that I came away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went through all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>There came to him a leper, begging him and kneeling to him and saying, "If you will, you can cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>He had compassion on him, and stretched out his hand and touched him, and said, "I do will it; be cleansed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>Immediately the leprosy left him and he became clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Then Jesus sent him away after strictly charging him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>"Be sure, do not say anything to anybody, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed for evidence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man went away and began to proclaim freely and to spread the report, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter openly into any city, but stayed out in the wild country, and people came to him from every direction.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>HE came again into Capernaum, and after some days it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>Many came together, so that there was no longer room even near the door, and he preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Then some people came bringing to him a paralytic, borne by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>Not being able to bring him near, owing to the crowd, they opened the roof where he was, and when they had broken through it, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>There were some of the scribes sitting there and debating in their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>"Why does this man talk so? He speaks profane words. Who except God can forgive sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Immediately Jesus, perceiving that they were inwardly reasoning in this way, said to them, "Why do you reason so in your minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins," turning to the paralytic he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I tell you, Rise, take up your pallet and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>Immediately the man rose and took up his pallet and went out before all, so that they were astounded and gave praise to God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Jesus went out again beside the lake, and all the crowd came to him and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he was passing along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office and said to him, "Follow me." He arose and followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Jesus was reclining at table in Levi's house, and many tax collectors and sinners also reclined at table along with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>When the scribes and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Can it be that he eats with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "The strong have no need of a physician, but the sick have. I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>The disciples of John as well as the Pharisees were fasting. They came and said to Jesus, "Why is it that the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not fasting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus replied, "Can guests at a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast, in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old coat. For the patch will break away, the new from the old, and a worse tear will be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No one pours new wine into old wine-skins. For the wine will burst the skins, and both wine and skins will be lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>It happened on a Sabbath day that he was passing through the grainfields, and his disciples began, as they walked, to pluck the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to him, "See what they are doing on the Sabbath \'97 something that is not allowable."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and his companions? \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he went into the house of God, when Abiathar was High Priest, and ate the consecrated loaves, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave them also to his companions?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>HE went another time into the synagogue and there was present a man with a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>They watched him to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might have something to say against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in the center."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he said to them, "Is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?" But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>He looked round on them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched the hand out and it was completely restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out immediately and joined with the Herodians in a plot to put him out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Then Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a great number from Galilee followed him. Also from Judaea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond the Jordan and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon, a great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>Jesus spoke to his disciples to have a little boat ready for his use on account of the throng, to prevent them from pressing upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he healed many, so that all that had diseases crowded around him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>The impure spirits, also, when they saw him, fell down before him and shouted, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But he ordered them repeatedly and sternly not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Jesus went up on the mountain and invited whom he chose, and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve who should be with him and whom he could send out to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>He appointed these twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter <note>Rock</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Jesus came into a house</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>and the crowd gathered again so that they were not able even to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his family heard of it, they went out to take him by force, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, "He has Beelzebul in him, and by the Chief of the demons he casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>Jesus called them to him and said to them in figures: "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house divides against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>So if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he can plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Truly I tell you all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men and all their profane words, whatever they may say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever speaks profane words against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an eternal sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>This he said because they said, "He has an impure spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then came his mother and his brothers, and standing outside sent and called him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>A crowd was sitting around him when some one said to him, "Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside and want you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>But he answered, "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Looking round at those sitting in the circle about him he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>AGAIN Jesus began to teach beside the lake, and a very great crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat on the lake and sat down, and all the crowd was on the shore near the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He taught them many things by figures of speech. He said to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen; a sower went out to sow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and it happened, as he was sowing, that some seed fell beside the road and the birds came and ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Other seed fell on stony places where it had not much earth, and it sprang up at once because it had no depth of soil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun came up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>Other seed fell into good ground and grew tall and strong and yielded thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>He said to them, "Let him who has ears to hear with hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was alone, his close friends and the twelve asked him about the illustrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He replied, "To you the mystery of the kingdom of God has been confided. But to outsiders all things come in figures of speech</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that they may look straight and yet not see, and hear plainly, yet not understand, and thus they will never repent and be forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>He said to them, "Do you not understand this illustration? How, then, will you understand all the illustrations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>These are those in whom the message is sown by the roadside \'97 such as hear, but immediately Satan comes and takes away the message that was sown in their minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>These are they likewise who received seed on stony places \'97 such as hear and immediately and gladly receive the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but, since they have no root, but are fickle, whenever trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>Others are those who receive seed among thorns \'97 such as hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the passions for other things come in and choke the word, and it turns out barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>These are those who received seed in good ground \'97 such as hear the message and receive it and yield thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He said to them, "A light is not brought in to be put under a peck-measure or under a bed, is it? Is it not brought to be placed on the stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden except to be manifested; nor was anything made secret except to come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any one has ears to hear with, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>He said again to them, "Be careful what you hear. With the measure that you measure with, it will be measured to you, and more will be given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For to him who has will be given, and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He said again, "The kingdom of God is like this: A man casts seed on the ground</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and goes on sleeping by night and rising by day, and the seed sprouts and grows up, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The ground of itself yields fruit: first the stalk, then the ear, then comes the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>When the grain is ripe immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>Again he said, "With what shall we compare the kingdom of God? or by what figure can we illustrate it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the ground, although it is the least of all the seeds that are in the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs, and puts out great branches so that the birds of the air can find shelter under its shadow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such illustrations he went on talking to them as they were able to listen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>but except in figures of speech he did not talk to them. Privately to his own disciples he explained all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On that day when evening came he said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>So they left the crowd and took him along just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>Then a heavy squall of wind came up and the waves beat into the boat so that it was filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But he was in the stern asleep on the cushion. They aroused him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are sinking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>When he awoke, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Hush, be still." The wind ceased and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>Then he asked them, "Why are you so timid? How is it you have no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>But they were intensely awestruck and said to one another, "Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the lake obey him?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>THEY came to the other side of the lake, to the land of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>When he got out of the boat, immediately there came out of the tombs to meet him a man under the power of an impure spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>This man made his dwelling in the tombs, and nobody could bind him even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart and the fetters broken in pieces by him, and no one was strong enough to tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>All night and all day long he was in the tombs and in the mountains, shrieking and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>When he saw Jesus a long way off, he ran and knelt to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and shouted with a loud voice, "What have I and you to do with each other, Jesus, Son of God most high? I adjure you by God, not to torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For Jesus had said to him, "Come out from the man, you impure spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion is my name, for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>Then he begged Jesus earnestly not to send them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>There was on the mountain-side a great herd of swine feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and the demons begged him, "Send us to the swine and let us go into them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>He consented. The impure spirits came out of the man and entered into the swine. Then the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>At this, those who were feeding them fled and told it in the city and in the fields, and people came to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they came to Jesus, they saw the demoniac, the man who had had the legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. They were struck with awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Those who had seen it told them about what had happened to the demoniac and about the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began to beg him to go away from their neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As Jesus was entering the boat, the man who had been demoniac begged him to let him stay with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>He, however, did not consent, but said, "Go to your own house and to your family, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>So he went away and began to make known in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>When Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a great crowd gathered around him as he stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, by the name of Jairus, and as soon as he saw Jesus he fell at his feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and pleaded with him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is near to death. I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>Jesus went away with him and a great crowd followed and pressed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>There was a woman who had for twelve years had a hemorrhage</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered much under the treatment of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, though without becoming better, but rather worse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>this woman had heard about Jesus, and she came in the crowd behind him and touched his cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she said, "If I can touch even his clothes, I shall be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>Immediately the hemorrhage ceased and she knew in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Jesus was at once conscious that power had gone from him, and turned in the crowd and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples replied, "You see the people crowding you, and do you ask, 'Who touched me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>But he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>Then the woman, afraid and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell before him and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well of your trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the synagogue Director and told him, "Your daughter is dead; why annoy the teacher any longer?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the Director, "Never fear; only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>He did not permit any one to accompany him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>When they approached the Director's house, they saw a noisy crowd weeping loudly and wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>He entered and said, "Why are you making so much noise and weeping so? The child is not dead, but is sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>But they laughed at him. Then he put them all out and took the child's father and mother and his own companions and went in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>Taking hold of the child's hand he said to her, "Talitha koum," which means, "Little girl, rise up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Immediately the little girl rose up and walked around. She was twelve years old. They were utterly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>But he strictly ordered that no one should know it, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>LEAVING there, he came to his own native place accompanied by his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue. Many who heard were astonished and said, "Where did he get this, and what is this wisdom with which he is gifted? How are such deeds of power done by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?" So they fell into mistake regarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own native place and among his own kindred and in his own home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>There he was unable to do any work of power, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>Their lack of faith astonished him. He made a circuit through the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>Then he called together the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over impure spirits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>and instructed them not to take anything for their journey but just a stick; no bread, no bag, no coppers in their belts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>to be shod with sandals, and not to have two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>Wherever the people will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>They went out and proclaimed that men should repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>and they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>The name of Jesus was so much talked about that King Herod heard of it. Some were saying, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these mighty works are done by him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, "It is Elijah," and others said, "It is a prophet like one of the old prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But Herod, when he heard about him, said, "John, the man whom I beheaded, has risen again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had said to Herod, "It is not right for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Herodias hated him and wished to kill him, but was unable to do so,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>because Herod reverenced John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When Herod heard John, he was much perplexed, and yet he was glad to listen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>But an opportunity came for Herodias when Herod, on his birthday, gave a feast to his high officials and military officers and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>Then the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and his guests. The King said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you will and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He swore, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to the half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>The girl went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" She replied, "The head of John the Baptizer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>The girl immediately hurried in and said to the King, "I choose to have you give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>This made the King very sorry, but on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>So he immediately sent one of the guardsmen with orders to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in the prison</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When John's disciples heard about it, they came and took the body and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles gathered back to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and all that they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>He said to them, "Come away alone into some solitary place and rest a little." For there were many people coming and going, and they had no time even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>So they put off in a boat for an uninhabited, solitary place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But many saw them going and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the towns and got there before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When Jesus landed, he saw a great crowd, and he was filled with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began and taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>By this time it was late in the day, and his disciples came to him and said, "This is an uninhabited place and the hour is already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away so that they can go to the farms and villages around and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But Jesus answered, "Give them something to eat yourselves." They said, "Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings worth of bread and feed them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He asked, "How many loaves have you? Go and see." When they had ascertained they said, "Five, and there are two fishes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then he told them to have all the people recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>They lay down in rows by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed them, and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. The two fishes he also divided among all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>All ate and had abundance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>and they picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces of the bread, besides portions of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>There were five thousand men who ate of the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Jesus immediately had his disciples get into the boat and cross before him to Bethsaida while he was dismissing the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>After taking leave of them, he went away up the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>When evening had fallen, the boat was half across the lake and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>He saw them distressed in rowing, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, he came to them walking on the lake and he seemed to be going past them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought that it was a ghost and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw him and were frightened. But he immediately spoke to them and said, "Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then he got into the boat with them and the wind dropped. They were in boundless amazement;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they had not grasped the miracle of the loaves because their minds were dull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed to the land they came to Gennesaret and dropped anchor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and hurried over all that region and brought in the sick on pallets wherever they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>Whenever he went into villages or towns or among the farms they would lay the sick in the streets and beg him to let them touch at least the tassel of his cloak. And all who touched were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>ONCE the Pharisees gathered about him with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>and they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with "common," that is, unwashed, hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees and all the Jews never eat without first washing their hands up to the wrist, holding faithfully to the tradition of their forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and when they return from market they do not eat until they have washed. There are also many other traditions which they have been taught to hold tenaciously, such as washing cups and pitchers and copper vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do not your disciples live according to the tradition of our fore-fathers? Why do they eat their bread with common hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>He replied, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites when he wrote: 'This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>in vain they worship me, while they teach what are merely commandments of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>Neglecting the commands of God, you hold firmly to the traditions of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>He said further to them, "How thoroughly you set aside the command of God so that you may keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, 'Honor thy father and thy mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, 'If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever benefit you enjoy from me is now Korban, that is, a gift to God,' \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and many similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>Then, calling the crowd to him again, he said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from outside a man that can go into him and defile him, but the things that come out of the man are the things that defile the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked about his figurative language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He said, "Are you too so lacking in insight? Do you not know that everything from outside that goes into a man is unable to defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>for it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and passes out into the sewer?" Thus he pronounced all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>"But," he said, "what comes out of a man is what defiles him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>for from within, out of the hearts of men, come evil thoughts, unchastities, thefts, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>adulteries, lusts, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, arrogance, recklessness \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these had things come out from within, and they defile the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>Leaving that place, Jesus went into the borders of Tyre. He entered a house and did not wish any one to know it, but he could not escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>At once a woman whose daughter was afflicted by an impure spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But he said, "Let the children be well fed first. For it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>She answered, "Yes, Sir, even the dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then he said to her, "For this answer, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>She returned to her house and found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Again leaving the region of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the lake of Galilee into the midst of the region of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>They brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>He took him aside from the crowd, put his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue with spit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, "Ephphatha" that is, Be opened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>and his ears were opened, and immediately his tongue was freed and he talked plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell any one. But the more he forbade them the more widely they spread it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>for they were astonished beyond all bounds and said, "He has done everything well. He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>IN those days, when there was again a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called together his disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>"I have compassion on the crowd because they have already spent three days with me and they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>If I send them home hungry, they will faint on the way. Some of them are from a long way off."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples answered, "Where will any one be able to get bread to supply these people here in the uninhabited country?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, "How many loaves have you?" They said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>He told the people to recline on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and, after giving thanks, broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had also a few small fishes. These he blessed and told the disciples to distribute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>All ate and were satisfied, and they picked up of the fragments that were left over seven basketfuls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>There were about four thousand men. Then he dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>At once he got into a boat with the disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, asking him for a sign from heaven, in order to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a sign? In truth I tell you no sign will be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>Then he left them and got into the boat again and went away across the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>They had forgotten to take bread, and except one loaf they had none with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Jesus warned them, "Beware, be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>They began to talk among themselves about their lack of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>He perceived it, and said to them, "Why are you talking about your lack of bread? Do you not yet know or understand? Have you dull minds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>You have eyes; can you not see? You have ears; can you not hear? Do you not remember</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of fragments you picked up?" They said, "Twelve."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He said, "Do you not understand even yet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>They came to Bethsaida. There some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Again Jesus put his hand on his eyes, and he looked and was restored and saw everything clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Then Jesus sent him away home, saying, "Do not go into the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Jesus went away with his disciples to the villages round Caesarea Philippi. On the road he asked them, "Who do the people say that I am?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; others say one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>He asked them, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>He gave them strict orders not to tell any one about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>Then he began and taught them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes, and to be put to death, and after three days to rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>He spoke about this frankly. But Peter took him and began to reprove him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>HE said further to them, "I tell you truly that there are some of those who are standing here, who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God already here in power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days later, Jesus took Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain. They were all alone. There in their presence he became transfigured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His clothes became dazzlingly white, with a whiteness that no bleacher on earth can impart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them and conversed with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is fine for us to be here. Let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>For he did not know what to say, they were so frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>Then a cloud overshadowed them and there came a voice out of the cloud, "This is my beloved son, hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>Then suddenly as they looked around they no longer saw any one, but Jesus only, with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>When they were descending the mountain, he told them not to tell any one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>This command they kept, but debated among themselves what the rising from the dead was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>They asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said, "Elijah does come first and reforms everything. How is it written also of the Son of Man that he suffers many things and is treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>I tell you Elijah has already come, and they have done to him what they chose, just as it was written of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When they came to his disciples, they saw a great crowd around them and scribes debating with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>At once the whole crowd saw him and were amazed, and they ran to him and welcomed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>He asked them, "What are you debating?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>One of the crowd answered, "Teacher, I have brought my son to you. He has a dumb spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and whenever it attacks him it convulses him and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. He is wasting away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they had not the power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus answered, "O faithless generation! how long must I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>They brought him to him. As soon as the spirit saw Jesus, he convulsed the boy so that he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Jesus asked the father, "How long is it since this came on him?" He said, "From early childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>Often it has thrown him into the fire or into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said, " 'If you can'! All things are possible for one who believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>At once the father of the child cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>Jesus saw that the crowd was rapidly increasing, so he rebuked the impure spirit with the words, "Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you to come out and never to enter him again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>He screamed and convulsed the boy and came out. The boy looked like a corpse, so that most of them said, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>He said, "This kind cannot come out by any means except by prayer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>After leaving there, they were passing through Galilee, and he did not wish any one to know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For he was teaching his disciples and telling them that the Son of Man would be betrayed into the hands of men and that they would kill him, and that three days after being killed he would rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand what he said and were afraid to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>They came to Capernaum. After entering the house, Jesus asked them, "What were you discussing on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>They were silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves which was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>Taking a seat he called the twelve, and said, "If any one wishes to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>Then he took a little child and placed him in the midst of them, and, putting his arms around him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>"Whoever receives one of such little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives not me, but him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name \'97 a man who does not follow us \'97 and we told him not to do it, because he does not follow us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>Jesus said, "Do not tell him not to do it. For no one who does a miracle in my name can quickly speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They kept trying to seize him, but were afraid of the crowd. For they knew that he had meant the illustration for them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to entrap him in his talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are true and are not afraid of any one; for you do not look at the social standing of men, but you teach the way of God in truth. Is it right to pay tribute to Caesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we pay or shall we not pay?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a coin and let me see it."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then there came to him some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>"Teacher, Moses wrote a law for us that if any man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but no child, the brother shall take the wife and raise up off-spring for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died leaving no child,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>then the second took her and died leaving no child, then the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>None of the seven left any child. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>And concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses in the passage about the Bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Then came one of the scribes, and, after listening to their discussion and knowing that he had answered them well, asked, "Which is the first commandment of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>This is the second, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>The scribe said to him, "Right, teacher; you have said truly that he is one and there is no other beside him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love one's neighbor as one's self is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jesus, seeing that he had answered with intelligence, said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one dared question him further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Then Jesus asked, while teaching in the Temple courts, "How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself, guided by the Holy Spirit, said, 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand till I put your enemies under your feet.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>They eat up widows' houses and hypocritically make long prayers. These men will receive a severer condemnation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Having seated himself across from the contribution box, he was watching how the crowd dropped money into the box. Many rich people were dropping in large gifts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>There came a poor widow and dropped in two mites, in value one penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, "I tell you truly, this widow, poor as she is, has dropped in more than all the others who are dropping money into the contribution box.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all contributed out of their superfluity, but she out of her poverty dropped in all that she had \'97 the whole of what she had to live on."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>THE Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were to come after two days. The high priests and the scribes were contriving how they might seize him by some stratagem and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>For they said, "Not at the feast; there might be a popular outbreak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>During his stay in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was reclining at table there came a woman with an alabaster jar of pure nard perfume, very costly. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some were indignant among themselves and said, "For what purpose was this waste of the perfume?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>This perfume could have been sold for more than three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor." So they were indignant at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, "Let her alone. Why are you annoying her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the high priests to betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He meanwhile was contriving how he could betray him at some favorable time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>On the first day of unleavened bread \'97 when they sacrificed the Passover lamb \'97 his disciples said to him, "Where do you wish us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>and wherever he goes in, say to the householder, 'The Teacher says, Where is the guest room for me where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>The Son of Man is going just as it has been written concerning him, but alas for that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! Well were it for that man if he had not been born!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>While they were eating, he took a loaf and blessed it and broke it and gave to them, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>Jesus said to them, "You will all fail, because it has been written, 'I will smite the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered abroad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>But after I am raised up I will precede you into Galilee."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>But he kept saying more earnestly, "Though I have to die with you, I will not disown you." Just so they all said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>They came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>He took Peter and James and John with him and began to be in terror and distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>He said to them, "My soul is in anguish, to the point of death. Stay here and watch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>Then he went forward a little and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee. Take away this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>Watch and pray that you may not fall into temptation. The spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>Again he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>He came back the third time and said to them, "Are you sleeping on? Are you resting? That is enough. The hour has come. Now the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Rise, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>Immediately, even while he was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, was there and with him a crowd with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the high priests and the scribes and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>The traitor had given them a sign, "The man I kiss, that is he. Seize him and take him safely away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>So when he came, he immediately advanced to Jesus and said, "Rabbi," and kissed him affectionately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>They laid their hands on him and held him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>But one of those who stood near drew his sword and struck a servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>Jesus said to them, "Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would a robber?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then all his friends left him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>There was a young man following him who had thrown a linen cloth around his naked body. They seized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>but he left the linen cloth and fled naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>They led Jesus away to the High Priest, and all the high priests and elders and scribes assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>Peter followed him at a distance and came inside the court of the High Priest and sat with the attendants, and warmed himself in the light of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>The high priests and all the council tried to get testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they could not find any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>Many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>Then some rose and testified falsely against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this Temple made by hands and in three days I will build another not made by hands.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But their testimony did not agree even regarding this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>Then the High Priest rose and came forward into the midst and questioned Jesus, "Have you no answer? What about this evidence against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he was silent and did not answer a word. Again the High Priest questioned him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>Jesus said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the High Priest rent his garments and said, "Why do we any longer have need of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard his impious words. How does it appear to you?" They all condemned him as deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then some began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to strike him with their fists and say, "Prophesy," and the attendants slapped him as they took him in charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the High Priest came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and when she saw Peter warming himself she looked at him and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, this Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it and said, "I do not know nor understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the outer courtyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>There the maid saw him and began again to say to those who stood around, "This man is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he again denied. Again after a little the men who were standing by said to Peter, "Truly you are one of them, for you are a Galilaean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man you are speaking of."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>Immediately, for the second time, the cock crew and Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times," and when he thought of it he wept aloud.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>PROMPTLY at dawn the high priests, after holding a consultation with the elders and the scribes and the whole council, bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "I am."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>It was customary that at every feast he should release some one prisoner at their request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>There was a man called Barabbas in chains among those insurrectionaries who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that it was on account of envy that the high priests had handed him over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the high priests incited the crowd to have him rather set free Barabbas for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>Pilate again asked, "What, then, shall I do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They again shouted, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>But Pilate said to them, "What has he done that was wrong?" But they shouted violently, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>Then Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set free Barabbas for them and after scourging Jesus handed him over to be crucified.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, "Do not be frightened. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. This is the place where they laid him.</verse>
