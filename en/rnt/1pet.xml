  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>PETER, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Chosen Ones of the scattered Jews in foreign lands who are living in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father and made holy by the Spirit to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace be to you and peace be multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>a birth into an inheritance immortal, unstained and unfading, kept in heaven for you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who are guarded by the power of God through faith for the salvation which is ready to be revealed on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you are sorrowful in trials of many kinds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that your tested faith, much more precious than gold that perishes though tested by fire, may be found to your praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom you love though you have not seen him; in whom you have faith though now you do not see him, and you rejoice with unspeakable and glorious joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>while you receive the reward of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Regarding this salvation the prophets who foretold the grace that was to come to you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>inquired and searched, trying to find out what time, or what sort of time, the Spirit of Christ which was in them was disclosing when it witnessed beforehand regarding the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who have told you the good news by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven \'97 things which angels earnestly long to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore brace up your minds, be calm and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>As obedient children, do not shape your lives by the passions that ruled you in the former days of ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but, like the Holy One who has called you, become yourselves holy in all your way of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>for it is written, "You shall be holy because I am holy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>And if you call upon him as Father who impartially judges by each one's work, live out the time of your sojourn here in reverence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.18'>for you know that you were not ransomed with perishable things, silver or gold, from your purposeless life handed down from your forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but by precious blood, as of a faultless, spotless lamb, the blood of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of time for your sake</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through him are faithful to God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Now that you have made your souls holy by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, you must love one another steadily from your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.23'>for you have been reborn, not from mortal seed but from immortal by the living and enduring word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>For "All flesh is like grass and all its glory is like the flower of the grass; the grass withers and the flower falls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.25'>but the word of the Lord endures forever." And this is the word of good news that has been brought to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>THEN lay aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and every kind of slander,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>and, like new-born babes, long for the reasonable pure milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if you have tasted that the Lord is kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>Coming to him, a living stone, rejected by men but with the Lord chosen and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also as living stones are built up, a spiritual house, and become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore it is contained in Scripture, "See, I am laying in Zion a chosen stone, an honored corner stone. He who has faith in him will not be put to shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>To you who have faith is the "honor," but to the unbelieving "the stone which the builders rejected \'97 that has become the corner stone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>a stone for the foot to strike, a rock to stumble over." Their feet strike the message because of their unbelief, and to this they were destined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, that you may proclaim the virtues of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God: once you had not found compassion, but now you have found compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I beg you, as foreigners and resident aliens, to shun the passions of the flesh which war against the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>Keep your daily life among the Gentiles honorable, so that, although they talk against you as if you were wrongdoers, they may, from your noble deeds that they see, glorify God on the day of inspection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be submissive to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of wrongdoers and the praise of those who do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God \'97 that by doing good we shall silence the ignorance of thoughtless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>Live as free men, yet not using freedom as a cloak for wickedness, but as God's slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all men, love the brotherhood, reverence God, honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Household servants, be submissive with all reverence to your lords, not only to the good and fair, but also to the surly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is grace if for conscience toward God any one bears pain, suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what credit is it if when you sin and are struck with the fist you are patient? But if though doing well, you suffer and are patient, that is grace in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ too suffered for you, leaving you an example that you might follow in his foot-steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>He had done no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>When he was reviled he did not revile back; he suffered, but made no threat; he committed himself to him who judges justly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>He bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we might die to sins and live to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were going astray like sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>IN the same way you wives are to be submissive to your own husbands, so that if any disbelieve the message they may be won over by the lives of their wives without argument,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>when they look at your pure, reverential behavior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Your adornment must not be of the external kind \'97 braiding the hair and putting on gold and wearing fine dresses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>but the hidden personality of the heart must wear the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is in God's sight most precious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For so of old the holy women who hoped in God adorned themselves. They were submissive to their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him Master. You have become her children when you do well and feel no terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>In the same way, you husbands must live with your wives wisely, since woman's sex is weaker, but you must give them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all must be like-minded, sympathetic, full of brotherly love, compassionate, humble-minded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not repaying evil for evil or abuse for abuse, but rather blessing, for that is what you were called for \'97 to inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For "He who would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>He must turn away from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against wrongdoers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is it that will harm you if you become earnest for the good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But if you should suffer for being righteous, you are blessed. Have no fear of them and do not be disturbed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>but exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts and be always ready to defend yourselves to every one who asks you to give account of the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>Keep a good conscience that, although you are slandered, those who misrepresent your good life in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better to suffer, if that should be God's will, for doing good than for doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ once for all died for sins, a righteous man for unrighteous men, so that he might lead us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who were once disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared, into which a few, that is eight souls, went and were saved through water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>This is a type of baptism, which now saves us \'97 not the putting off of soil from the flesh, but the endeavor for a good conscience toward God through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>Now that he has gone into heaven he is at the right hand of God, and angels and authorities and powers have been made subject to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>SINCE, then, Christ suffered in the flesh, you also must arm yourselves with the same mind. For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>so that he does not go on living what remains of his time in the flesh according to human passions, but according to God's will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>The time that has passed was enough to spend doing the will of the Gentiles, when you went on in indecencies, passions, hard drinking, revelries, carousings, and lawless idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In these they think it strange that you are not running with them to the same excess of profligacy, and they slander you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>But they will have to give account to him who holds himself ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>And for this purpose the good news was told even to the dead, that they might be judged like men in the flesh, but live as God does in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>The end of all things is near. Therefore be serious and sober and give yourselves to prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>Above all things have earnest love to one another, for love hides a host of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>Let each, as he has received a spiritual gift, serve the others in that way, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If any one speaks, let it be as uttering the oracles of God. If any one serves, let it be from the strength that God supplies. Thus in all things let God be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him be glory and strength for the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery fury that is among you, which has come to try you, as if some strange thing were happening to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>But rejoice since to this extent you are sharing the sufferings of Christ, that when his glory is revealed you may rejoice and exult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reproached for the name of Christ you are blessed, for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>No one of you must suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as a wrongdoer or as a meddler in other men's affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>But if he suffers as a Christian he should not be ashamed, but should glorify God by that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God. And if it begins first with us, what will be the end of those who disobey the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>If the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the godless and sinful appear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>So then let those who are suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.1'>THE elders among you I beg \'97 I who am a fellow elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ and a sharer in the glory soon to be revealed \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.2'>I beg you to shepherd the flock of God that is among you, not because you must, but willingly, not for base gain, but eagerly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.3'>not lording it over your charges, but becoming examples to the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.4'>Then when the chief Shepherd appears you will be repaid with the never-fading crown of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.5'>In the same way you younger men must be subject to your elders. You all must put on the apron of humble service for one another. For God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.6'>Humble yourselves, then, under the mighty hand of God so that he may lift you up at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.7'>Cast all your anxiety on him, for he cares for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.8'>Be sober, watch. Your enemy the Devil, like a roaring lion, goes about seeking some one to devour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.9'>Resist him firm in the faith and knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being completed in your brotherhood throughout the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.10'>The God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little will equip, establish and strengthen you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.11'>To him be power for the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.12'>By Silvanus, your faithful brother, as I esteem him, I am writing to you briefly, to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Take your stand in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.13'>She who is in Babylon, chosen with you, sends her greeting to you, and so does Mark my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.5.14'>Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.</verse>
