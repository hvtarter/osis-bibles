  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>JUDE, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, to those who are in God the Father, beloved, kept for Jesus Christ and called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Beloved, although I have been making every effort to write to you regarding our common salvation, I now find it necessary to write and urge you to contend vigorously for the faith that was once for all delivered to the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For certain persons have crept in, who of old were written of as predestined to this doom, godless, changing the grace of our God into profligacy and disowning our only Ruler and Lord, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>I wish to remind you, although you know all things once for all, that the Lord, after saving a people from the land of Egypt, then destroyed those who had no faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>and angels who did not keep their own rank, but left their own abode, he has kept for the judgment of the great day in everlasting chains under blackness of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>So Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, which in the same way gave themselves up to unchastity and the pursuit of unnatural vices, serve as an example while they undergo the punishment of eternal fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>Just so these dreamers defile the flesh, reject government, and speak abusively of glorious beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>But Michael, the arch-angel, when in dispute with the Devil he was arguing about the body of Moses, did not venture to bring against him an abusive judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But these speak profanely of whatever they do not know, and all that physically as irrational animals they do understand, in these things they corrupt themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Alas for them! for they have traveled in the path of Cain, and for hire have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are the hidden reefs in your love-feasts while they feast freely with you without fear, shepherds who care only for themselves, waterless clouds driven by winds, trees in autumn fruitless, twice dead, uprooted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>wild waves of the sea foaming out their own shame, wandering stars for which the blackness of darkness is reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these men when he said, "See, the Lord has come with ten thousand of his holy ones</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>to do judgment upon all and to convict all the irreverent of all their deeds of irreverence which they have irreverently done, and of all the hard things which they have spoken against him, irreverent sinners that they are."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These men are complaining grumblers, living according to their own passions, and their mouths speak great swelling words. They show admiration for persons for the sake of their own gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, beloved, remember the words which were long ago spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>how they told you that in the latter time there would be scoffers living according to their own ungodly passions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are those who cause divisions, sensual and unspiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>must keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you into life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>On some have pity when they are in doubt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>pull them out of the fire and save them. Others pity with fear, hating even the tunic spotted by the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>To him who is able to guard you from falling and to make you stand faultless before his glory in great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>to the only God our Savior, be, through Jesus Christ our Lord, glory, majesty, might, and authority, before all time and now and for all the ages! Amen.</verse>
