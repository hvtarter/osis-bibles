  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='2Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.1'>PAUL and Silvanus and Timothy to the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.3'>We ought always to thank God for you, brethren, as is fitting, since your faith is growing greatly and the love of each and all of you toward one another is increasing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.4'>so that we ourselves glory in you among the churches of God because of your endurance and faith in all of your persecutions and in the distresses you are bearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.5'>This is a proof of God's righteous judgment. It is to make you worthy of God's kingdom, on behalf of which you are suffering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.6'>since it is just on God's part to repay with trouble those who are troubling you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.7'>and to repay to you, who are being troubled, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.8'>With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.9'>They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction and be sent away from the face of the Lord and from his glorious power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.10'>when he comes to be glorified among his holy ones and to be wondered at on that day among all believers \'97 for our testimony to you was believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.11'>To this end we are always praying for you that our God will make you worthy of the call, and will by his power bring to completion every one of your kind purposes and works of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.1.12'>that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>WITH regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to meet him, I beg you, brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>not to be quickly unsettled in mind nor excited by either a revelation or by a message or a letter supposed to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is close at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one lead you astray in any way, because it will not come until the Apostasy has first come and the Man of Lawlessness has been revealed \'97 the Son of Perdition,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.4'>who opposes and exalts himself above everything called God and every object of worship, so that he enters the Temple of God and seats himself there, declaring that he himself is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.5'>Do you not remember that while I was still with you I used to tell you this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.6'>And now you know what is restraining him until he is revealed at his appointed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.7'>For the mystery of lawlessness is already working, only there is just now one who is restraining it until he passes out of the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.8'>And then the Lawless One will be revealed. But the Lord Jesus will sweep him away with the breath of his mouth and will make him powerless by the splendor of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.9'>For his coming will be when Satan is active in every sort of power and in false signs and wonders</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.10'>and in every kind of wicked deception of those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.11'>For this reason God sends to them a deceptive influence so that they believe a lie,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that all who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness may be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.13'>We ought always to thank God for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through the Spirit's making you holy and your own faith in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.14'>To this he called you through the good news that we brought, so that you may share the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.15'>Now then, brethren, stand firm and hold fast the teachings that you have been taught whether by our words or by our letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.16'>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal encouragement and good hope through grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.17'>encourage your hearts and make you strong in every good word and work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.1'>IN conclusion, brethren, pray for us, that the Lord's message may run and be glorified, as among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.2'>and that we may be saved from the unreasonable and wicked men, for faith does not belong to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.3'>But the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen you and guard you from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.4'>We are persuaded in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing and will do what we direct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.5'>The Lord guide your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.6'>We charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to stand aloof from every brother who is living in a disorderly way and not according to the teaching that you received from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.7'>For you yourselves know that you should imitate us, for we were not disorderly when among you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.8'>nor did we eat bread with any one without paying, but with labor and toil night and day we worked in order not to burden any one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not that we have not the authority, but in order to give you ourselves as an example for you to imitate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>For when we were with you we gave you this command, "If any one will not work, neither is he to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that some among you are leading disorderly lives, busy about nothing and yet busybodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Such we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.13'>But you, brethren, must not become discouraged in doing well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.14'>If any one does not obey our words in this letter, mark that man and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.15'>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.16'>The Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.17'>The greeting of Paul by my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is my handwriting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.</verse>
