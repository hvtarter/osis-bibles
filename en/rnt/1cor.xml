  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>PAUL called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the Church of God in Corinth, made holy in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, with all everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I am always thanking God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that you are rich in him in everything, in readiness of speech and in all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>so that my testimony to Christ has been confirmed among you</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>and so that you are not lacking in any gift while waiting for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>He will keep you strong to the end and free from reproach on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, and it is by him that you have been called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>I beg you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, all to say the same thing and not to have divisions among you, but to be united in the same mind and in the same opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been told me regarding you, brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are dissensions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>I mean that each of you is saying, "I belong to Paul," "I belong to Apollos," "I belong to Cephas," or, "I belong to Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I am thankful that I baptized no one of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>I baptized also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know that I baptized any one else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the good news \'97 not in wisdom of words, that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring to nought the prudence of the prudent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For when in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not come to know God, God was pleased to save through the foolishness of our proclamation those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek for wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we proclaim Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, to Gentiles folly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For God's foolishness is wiser than men and God's weakness is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>Consider your own call, brethren, that not many wise, humanly speaking, not many powerful, not many high-born have been called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and God has chosen the low-born things and the things of no account, the things that are not, to defeat the things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no human being may boast in God's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>By God's act you are in Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and deliverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>so that, as it is written, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>AND I in coming to you, brethren, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined to know nothing among you but Jesus Christ \'97 and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but with spiritual and powerful proof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith might not depend on the wisdom of man but on the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>We do speak wisdom among the mature, but a wisdom not of this world nor of the defeated rulers of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak a wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the world began for our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this world knew it, for if they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, "What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard and what has not entered human mind, God has prepared for those who love him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>To us God has revealed this by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who of men knows what pertains to a man except the spirit of the man which is in him. Just so no one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God, so that we know the gracious gifts of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>And these we speak of, not in words taught by man's wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual things in spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the animal man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, nor can he know them because they are spiritually understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man understands all things though he himself is understood by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Who will teach him?" But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>AND I myself, brethren, could not speak to you as spiritual, but as fleshly, as babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not solid food. For you were not able to take it. Nor are you yet able, for you are still fleshly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and living in man's way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apollos," are you not men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to faith, as the Lord granted to each of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he who planted anything nor he who watered, but God who makes the seed grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>We are God's fellow workers: you are God's farm God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God granted to me, as a wise master-builder I have laid a foundation and another is building on it. But let each be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>If any one builds on this foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, straw \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>every one's work will become manifest. For the day will show it, because it will be revealed in fire and the fire will test each one's work, of what quality it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work which any one has built stands he will get a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any one's work burns up he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one mars the temple of God, God will mar him, for the temple of God is holy, and you are the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you thinks himself wise in this world, let him become a fool in order to become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their own craftiness,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, "The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise to be futile."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come \'97 all are yours</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>LET a man view us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover, in the case of stewards it is required that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But it is of very slight importance to me to be judged by you or any human court. I do not even pass judgment on myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am not conscious of any wrong, but I am not proved by that to be faultless. The Lord is my judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So do not judge anything before the time, before the Lord comes. He will throw light on the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the purposes of hearts. Then each one will have his praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>All this, brethren, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sake, that you may learn the maxim, "Nothing beyond what is written," and may not be puffed up in partisanship for one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who gives you superiority? What have you that you did not receive? Why are you boasting as if you had not received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already fully satisfied. You have already become rich. You have become kings without us. Would that you had become kings so that we might be kings with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For it seems to me that God has set us apostles out last of all as men doomed to death, that we may be a spectacle to the world and to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you have glory, but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Up to this present hour we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten. We wander about</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labor, working with our own hands. When abused we bless, when persecuted we endure it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when slandered we entreat. We have come to be, as it were, the sweepings of the world, the riffraff of all things up to now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if you have ten thousand teachers in Christ, still you have not many fathers. For I was your father in Christ Jesus through the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>So I beg you to be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this very purpose I have sent to you Timothy, who is my loved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ \'97 how I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Some persons have become puffed up, thinking that I am not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I shall come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the talk of these puffed-up ones, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>Which do you wish? Shall I come with a rod or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>IT is generally reported that there is unchastity among you, and such unchastity as is not even among the Gentiles, so that a man has his father's wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are puffed up with pride and have not rather grieved and taken steps to expel from among you the doer of this deed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already as if I were present judged the man who has acted thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>When you assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit was also present with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>I decided to deliver over such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is unbecoming. Do you not know that a little yeast sets the whole mass fermenting?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Cleanse out the old yeast that you may be new dough, free from yeast, as indeed you are. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So let us keep the festival, not with the old yeast nor with the yeast of evil and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with unchaste people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>certainly not meaning the unchaste of this world, or the covetous or extortionate or idolaters, since in that case you would have to leave the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I write to you not to associate with any one who is called a brother, if he is unchaste or covetous or idolatrous or abusive or drunken or extortionate \'97 not even to eat with such a one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders? Is it not for you to judge those inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But outsiders God will judge. Expel the wicked man from among yourselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>DOES any one of you, if he has a grievance against another, dare to bring the case before the unrighteous and not before the holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the holy are going to judge the world? If the world is to be judged by you, are you unfit for the most trivial cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we are to judge angels, to say nothing of affairs of this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you have affairs of this life, do you ask men who in the view of the church count for nothing to sit as judges?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. Is it true that there is among you no one wise enough to judge between a man and his brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goes to law with brother and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Now this is an utter failure on your part that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you yourselves practice wrongs and frauds \'97 and that upon your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake, neither the unchaste, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who practice unnatural vices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor the avaricious, nor drunkards, nor the abusive, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such some of you were. But you have washed yourselves; but you have been made holy; but you have been pronounced righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful for me, but not everything is beneficial. All things are lawful, but I will not be overpowered by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food of all kinds is for the stomach and the stomach for foods. But God will end the function of one and the other. The body is not for unchastity, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>God raised the Lord and will also raise us through his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do you not know that he who unites himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For God says, "The two shall become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>He who is united to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Shun unchastity. Every other sin that a man does is apart from the body, but the unchaste sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For you were bought with a price. Glorify God then in your bodies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>WITH reference to the matters you wrote of: It is an excellent thing for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because of the prevailing unchastity, let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband pay his wife conjugal dues and the wife her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife has not power over her own body, but her husband has. In the same way the husband has not power over his own body, but his wife has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another, unless by agreement for a time, that you may have freedom for prayer, and again come together. You must not let Satan tempt you through your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>I say this by way of indulgence, not by way of command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish that every one were just as I am. But each has his own gift from God, one in one way and one in another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>I say to the unmarried and the widows, it is excellent for them to remain as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they lack self-control, let them marry. It is better to marry than to burn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I command \'97 yet not I, but the Lord \'97 that the wife is not to leave her husband</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>and those that we deem the less honorable parts of the body we surround with greater honor and our uncomely parts have additional dignity,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>IF I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I have the power of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And if I distribute all that I have to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is longsuffering, love is kind, is not jealous, love does not boast, is not conceited,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>does not behave unbecomingly, does not seek her own interest, is not irritable, does not count up her wrongs,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>excuses all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never fails; but if there are prophetic powers, they will become useless; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will become useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but when the perfect comes what is in part will become useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. Since I have become a man, I have no use for childish things.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>SEEK love earnestly, be eager for spiritual gifts, but most to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks with a tongue speaks not to men, but to God. For no one understands, and he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks to men what will build up, encourage, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I wish you all to speak with tongues, but I wish more to have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may receive upbuilding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you in a revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Inanimate things that give a sound, such as the flute or harp, \'97 unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is being played on flute or harp?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>If the trumpet gives a dubious sound, who will prepare himself for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>And so you, if you do not give by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is said? For you will be talking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a barbarian to him who is speaking, and he will be a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>And so you, since you are eager for spiritual gifts, seek to abound in what will build up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him who speaks with a tongue pray to interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What then? I will pray with the spirit and with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit and with the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>If you thank God with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the ordinary man say Amen to your thanksgiving? For he does not know what you are saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>You give thanks excellently, but the other is not helped by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I speak with tongues more than any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>But in church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so as to instruct others, than to speak ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, be not children in intelligence, but be babes in wickedness. In intelligence be adults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the Law it is written, "By men of strange speech and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and not even thus will they listen to me, says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then tongues are for a sign not to believers, but to unbelievers, and prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole church assembles and all speak with tongues and ordinary men or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are insane?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy and any unbeliever or ordinary man comes in, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so falling on his face he worships God, declaring that God is really among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What then, brethren? When you assemble each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for the upbuilding of character.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any one speaks with a tongue, let it be two, or at the most three, at a time and in turn and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>If there is no interpreter, let the man keep silent in church and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Of the prophets let two or three speak and let the others reflect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If a revelation comes to another who is sitting by, let the first become silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy one by one so that all may learn and all be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>The spirits of the prophets are under the control of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the holy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>let the women be silent in your assemblies. For it is not allowed to them to speak; but let them be in subjection as also the Law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Did the message of God come out from you or did it come to you alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I am writing to you is the command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any one does not know, he is himself unknown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So then, my brethren, seek earnestly to prophesy and do not hinder speaking with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done becomingly and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>LET me recall to your minds, brethren, the good news which I announced to you and which you accepted, in which also you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the message that I announced to you, unless your faith was thoughtless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For among the first things I passed on to you what I had received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most are still living, but some have fallen asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Last of all, as if to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles and am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not without result, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>But if Christ is proclaimed \'97 that he has been raised from the dead \'97 how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>If Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is an empty thing and your faith is an empty thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And we are found false witnesses of God because we testified regarding God that he raised up Christ, whom he did not raise if the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by a man came death, by a man also came resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order. The first-fruit is Christ, then those who are Christ's, at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then will be the end when he delivers up the kingship to God his Father, when he has defeated every archangel and authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must be king until he "puts all his enemies under his feet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be defeated will be death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For "he subjected all things under his feet." But when it says, "all things have been subjected," it is plain that it means all things except God who subjected all things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>But when all things have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Then what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are they then baptized for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why do we run risks every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I die every day, I swear it by the boast I make of you and which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If, humanly speaking, I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what is my gain? If the dead do not rise, "let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be led astray; "bad associations corrupt good morals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Return to soberness and cease to sin, for some are ignorant of God. I say it to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what sort of bodies do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Thoughtless man! What you yourself sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow is not the body that will come, but a mere grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body as he has pleased, and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another flesh of birds, and another flesh of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is of one kind and the glory of the terrestrial is of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars. For star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also will be the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in decay; it is raised imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown an animal body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is an animal body there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Just as it is written, "The first man Adam became a living animal," the last Adam became a lifegiving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But the spiritual is not first, but the animal, then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the earthly man such are also those who are earthly, and as is the heavenly man such are also those who are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the earthly man, we shall bear the image of the heavenly man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>But I say this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor will decay inherit imperishability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>I am telling you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be transformed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet-call. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be transformed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this perishable must clothe itself with imperishability, and this mortal must clothe itself with immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>When this perishable has clothed itself with imperishability and this mortal has clothed itself with immortality, then will come to pass the word that is written, "Death has been swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O Death, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; since you know that your labor is not fruitless in the Lord.</verse>
