  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.1'>PAUL, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.2'>and to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the Church that meets at your house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.4'>I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.5'>for I hear of the love and the loyalty that you have to the Lord Jesus Christ and to all the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.6'>I pray that your fellowship in the faith may become effective in the knowledge of all the good there is in us in our relation to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.7'>For I have had great joy and encouragement in your love, because the hearts of the holy have been refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.8'>Therefore, though I might have great boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.9'>I beg you rather for love's sake, as Paul the old man and now the prisoner of Christ Jesus \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.10'>I beg you in behalf of my child Onesimus, born to me in my chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.11'>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.12'>I am sending him back to you, though he is my very heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.13'>I should like to have him for my own, to serve me in my chains for the good news, as your representative,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.14'>but without your consent I am unwilling to do anything, so that your goodness may not be of necessity but of free will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.15'>Perhaps it was for this that he was separated from you for a time, that you might have him back for ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.16'>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.17'>If then you hold me for a partner, receive him as you would me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.18'>If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.19'>I, Paul, write it with my own hand. I will pay it \'97 not to mention to you that you owe me your own self besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.20'>Yes, brother, let me have this help from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.21'>I am writing to you confident of your obedience and knowing that you will do more than I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.22'>At the same time I want you to prepare a lodging for me, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given back to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.23'>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.24'>and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers, send you their greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phlm.1.25'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.</verse>
