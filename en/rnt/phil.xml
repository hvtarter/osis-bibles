  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>PAUL and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the Holy in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with Bishops and Deacons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I thank my God for all your remembrance of me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your fellowship in spreading the good news from the first day until now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun the good work in you will carry it on to completion on the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>So it is right for me to think of you all, because you have me in your hearts, and in my chains and in my defense and in establishing the good news you are all sharers in my privilege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness how much I long for you all in the affections of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>so that you may discriminate between the things that differ, that you may be pure and blameless in the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>filled with the fruit of knowledge through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>I wish you to know, brethren, that my affairs have turned out rather to the furtherance of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>so that my chains have become well known as for Christ to the whole Praetorian Guard and to all the rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and the most of the brethren in the Lord, made confident by my chains, are unusually brave in speaking the message fearlessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some indeed proclaim Christ because of envy and rivalry, some also because of good will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>Some announce Christ from love, knowing that I am placed for the defense of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>but others out of partisanship, thinking to add distress to my chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that this will make for my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>according to my earnest expectation and hope that I may be put to shame in nothing, but with all courage, as always, so now Christ may be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful work for me. I know not which to choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>I am under pressure both ways, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for it is far better,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>yet that I should stay in the flesh is more needful on your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And this I confidently know, that I shall stay and stay near you all for your advancement and joy of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that your exultation in Christ Jesus may overflow on my account, because of my presence again with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only exercise your citizenship in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or in absence hear news of you, I may know that you are standing in one spirit, with one mind wrestling in the faith of the good news</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>and not frightened in anything by your adversaries, which for them is a sign of ruin, but for you of salvation, and that from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>because it has been graciously allowed you not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for his sake,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>and you have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear of in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>IF there is any encouragement in Christ, any persuasive power in love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any sympathies and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>fill up my joy by having the same love, being of the same mind, thinking the same thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>doing nothing in a partisan or vainglorious way, but each modestly regarding the others as of more account than himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Do not be each intent on his own interests, but also on the interests of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, though he was in the form of God, did not think that equality with God was something to be grasped,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant and coming into the likeness of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and when found in the condition of a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient even to death \'97 death on the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Therefore, God has highly exalted him and has graciously given him the name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of beings in heaven and those on earth and those under the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So then, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with reverence and awe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is God who is working in you both the willing and the doing because of his kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do everything without murmurings or disputings</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may be blameless and pure, children of God, spotless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine as lights in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>holding forth the message of life, so that on the day of Christ I can boast that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But if I am poured out as a libation on your sacrificial offering of faith, I rejoice and share the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>In the same way you must rejoice and share my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I may be cheered by knowing about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one likeminded with him who will so sincerely care for your interests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all pursue their own aims, not those of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know how he has been tested and how like a child with a father he has served with me in spreading the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>So I hope to send him at once when I see how my affairs are going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I trust in the Lord that I myself shall come quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>I think it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he longs for you all and is troubled because you have heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Indeed he was sick and near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>I send him the more readily that you may see him and rejoice again and I be less sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold such men in honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ he was near to death, hazarding his life to complete the service you were not here to do for me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>TO conclude, my brethren: rejoice in the Lord. To repeat to you the same things is not tiresome to me and it is safe for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the bad workmen, beware of the excision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God and exult in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>though I have ground for confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has ground for confidence in the flesh, I have more \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>circumcised the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the Law a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>as to zeal persecuting the church, as to the righteousness of the Law blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But the things that were gain to me, those I have counted loss for Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yes, I count all to be loss because of the surpassing worth of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having my own righteousness that was from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God and rests on faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if possibly I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained it or have already been made perfect, but I press on to lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have laid hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and stretching forward to what is in front</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us all who are full grown think in this way. If in anything you think differently, even that God will reveal to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>but so far as we have attained let us walk in the same path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Unite in imitating me, brethren, and watch those who are living according to our example.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many are living as I used often to tell you and now say even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Their end is ruin, their God is their stomach, their glory is in their shame, they think earthly thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For the state of which we are citizens is in the heavens and from there we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>He will transform the body we have in our low estate into the likeness of the body he has in glory by the power by which he can subject all things to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>SO, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>I beg Euodia and I beg Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yes, I ask you, true yokefellow, help them, since they struggled in spreading the good news along with me and Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>Do not worry, but in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>To conclude, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is dignified, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovable, whatever is highly spoken of \'97 if there is any virtue or any praise \'97 think of that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>What you learned and accepted and heard and saw in me \'97 practice that. And the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length your thoughtfulness for me had revived. You were thoughtful for me all along, but lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I am speaking because of want; for I have learned how to be content in whatever circumstances I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to live humbly and I know how to enjoy abundance. In each and every situation I have been initiated into the secret both of being well fed and of going hungry, both of having abundance and of bearing want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I can do all things through him who gives me strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Yet you did nobly in sharing with me in my distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>You Philippians know that at the beginning of the good news, when I came away from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>and that in Thessalonica you sent once, yes, twice, for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I am seeking for the gift, but I am seeking for the fruit that increases to your credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>I have enough of everything and more than enough. I am fully supplied since receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>My God will supply every need of yours according to his wealth in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>To God our Father be glory for the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Greet every holy one in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me send greetings to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the holy send greetings to you, especially those of Caesar's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits!</verse>
