  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

  <div type='book' osisID='Heb'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>MANY times and in many ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>but at the end of these days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who is the reflection of his glory and the expression of his nature and sustains all things by his word of power, and who, when he had made purification from sins, took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited surpasses theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did he ever say, "Thou art my son; I have to-day become thy Father"? and again, "I will be to him a Father and he shall be to me a Son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again when he brings his first-born into the world of men he says, "And let all the angels of God bow down to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Referring to the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants a flame of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But regarding the Son he says, "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. Thy royal scepter is a scepter of justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou lovest righteousness and hatest lawlessness, therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And, "Thou, in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth, and the heavens are works of thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They will perish, but thou wilt endure. They all will grow old like a garment</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like a mantle thou wilt roll them up. But thou art the same and thy years will never end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which of the angels did he ever say, "Sit at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth for service in behalf of those who are to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>FOR this reason we should give special attention to the things that we have heard, so as not to drift away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the message spoken through angels was sure and every violation and disobedience received merited punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the beginning was spoken by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God added his testimony by signs and wonders and many kinds of miracles and impartation of the Holy Spirit according to his will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For he has not subjected to angels the coming world of which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But somewhere one says, "What is man that thou rememberest him? Or the son of man that thou carest for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels. With glory and honor thou hast crowned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>All things thou hast put under his feet." When he put all things under him he left nothing that was not put under him. We do not yet see all things put under him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death that by the grace of God he might taste of death for every man, now crowned with glory and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting that he through whom are all things and for whom are all things, when leading many sons to glory, should make the great Leader of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For he who makes holy and they who are made holy are all of one. For this cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, "I will tell thy name to my brothers. In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to thee,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>and again, "I will trust in him," and again, "Here am I and the children whom God has given me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since then the children share in blood and flesh, he himself in the same way shared in them, in order that through death he might defeat him who had the power of death, that is, the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and set free all those who through fear of death were all their lives doomed to slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For he does not come to the help of angels, but he comes to the help of the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>And for that reason he had to be made like his brethren in everything, so as to be a compassionate and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For since he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>THEREFORE, holy brethren, sharers in a heavenly call, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to him who made him as also Moses was in all God's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For he has been thought worthy of more glory than Moses, just as he who has built a house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by some one, but he who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant for a testimony to the things that were to be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ as a Son over his own house. We are his house if we hold firmly to the end our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Wherefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "To-day if you will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry on the day when they tried me in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>when your fathers put me to a test and saw my deeds for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was much displeased with that generation and said, 'They always go astray in their hearts and they do not know my paths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See to it, brethren, that there shall not be in any one of you a wicked, unbelieving heart ready to forsake the living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but encourage one another daily while it is called "to-day," that no one may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we become sharers with Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance with which we began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>When it is said, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they made me angry" \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>who when they heard made him angry? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>With whom was he much displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>To whom did he swear that they should not enter his rest, except to those who had no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>We see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>LET us, then, be afraid that, though the promise of entering his rest is still left, some one of you may seem to have missed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For we have received the good news just as they did, but the message that was heard did not benefit them, since it did not meet with faith in the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have faith are entering into the rest, as he said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter into my rest,' " although his works had been finished since the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day thus, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this place again, "They shall not enter into my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since, then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first received the good news did not enter because of lack of faith \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again he indicates a day, "to-day," saying in David so long after, as has been already quoted, "To-day if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest he would not be speaking of another day after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Therefore there still remains a rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into God's rest has rested from his works as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us endeavor then to enter into that rest so that no one shall fall, after that example of lack of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any two-edged sword, and it pierces until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>There is not a creature invisible to him, but all things are naked and defenseless before the eyes of him to whom we must account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Since, then, we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, for he has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us come with confidence to the throne of grace and receive compassion and find grace for timely help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>FOR every high priest taken from among men is appointed in behalf of men in things relating to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He is able to sympathize with the ignorant and the erring, since he himself is beset with weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>For this reason he must bring an offering for his own sins, just as he does for those of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no one takes this honor upon himself unless called by God, as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So too Christ did not take for himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but he who said to him, "Thou art my Son, to-day I have become thy Father,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>and who says in another place, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Christ, in the days of his flesh, offered prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, with strong outcries and tears, and was heard and saved from his terrors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although he was a Son he learned obedience from his sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being thus made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>and was proclaimed by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>Regarding Melchizedek we have much to say that is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For when, considering the time, you ought to be teachers you need to have some one teach you again the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For every one who takes milk is inexperienced in the doctrine of righteousness, for he is a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for adults who through practice have their senses exercised in distinguishing good and bad.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>THEREFORE let us leave elementary teaching about Christ and hasten on to what is advanced, not laying again a foundation \'97 change of heart from dead works, faith in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>the teaching about baptisms, the laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>This we will do if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who have been once for all enlightened and have tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted God's word and the powers of the coming world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and then have fallen away, to have again a change of heart, since they are crucifying for themselves afresh the Son of God and putting him to open shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it and bears plants useful to those for whom it is farmed shares in God's blessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but if it bears thorns and thistles it is judged worthless and is near to being cursed. In the end it will be burnt over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded of better things regarding you, beloved, things that belong with salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown to his name as you have served and are still serving the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire to have each one of you show to the end the same earnestness for the fulfillment of our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you may not be dull, but imitators of those who through faith and patience are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For God, when making the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, "Surely, I will greatly bless you and greatly multiply you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so after patient waiting Abraham obtained what was promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them the end of all dispute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In this case God being abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable purpose of his will gave the surety of an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to be false, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled to lay hold on the hope that lies before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>We have this hope as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and it enters into the tent within the curtain</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered in our behalf, becoming forever a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>FOR, this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham when he was returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>and to whom Abraham gave a tenth of all <note>first, by the translation of his name, "King of Righteousness," and then king of Salem, which means "King of Peace"</note>,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without ancestors, without either birthday or end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest permanently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But see how great this man was, since Abraham the patriarch gave him a tenth of his choicest spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And even those of the sons of Levi who attain the priesthood have command according to the Law to take a tenth from the people, their own brethren, although these have sprung from the loins of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he who had no genealogy from these took a tenth from Abraham and pronounced a blessing on him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Without dispute the less is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here mortal men receive tenths, but there one of whom the witness is that he is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And, to put it frankly, Levi, who receives the tenths, was made to pay a tenth through Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If, then, perfection had been through the Levitical priesthood, \'97 for on the basis of that the people received the Law \'97 what need was there for another kind of priest to arise and not be called of the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when the priesthood has been changed there comes of necessity also a change of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has ever had anything to do with the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is plain that our Lord has arisen from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And this is yet more abundantly evident if after the order of Melchizedek there arises a priest of a different kind</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment made for the flesh, but according to the power of unending life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is affirmed of him, "Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>There is a setting aside of the earlier commandment because of its weakness and uselessness \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>for the Law brought nothing to perfection \'97 and there is the bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And just as it was not without an oath \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>for those men have become priests without an oath, but he with an oath from him who said to him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: thou art a priest forever" \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much better is the covenant of which Jesus has become surety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>And many of them became priests because they were prevented by death from continuing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because he continues forever, has an unending priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>And so he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, since he is forever living to intercede for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such was the High Priest that we needed, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>He has not the daily need, like the other priests, first to offer sacrifices for his own sins and then for those of the people. This latter he did once for all when he offered himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the Law makes high priests of men who have infirmities, but the word of the oath, which comes after the Law, makes High Priest of a Son who is perfected forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>THE chief point of what I have been saying is this: we have such a High Priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>and who ministers in the holy place and in the true Tent set up by the Lord, not by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices. Whence it is necessary for this one to have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>If he were upon the earth he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>They minister as an example and shadow of the things in heaven, just as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the Tent. "See," it was said, "that you make everything according to the model shown you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now Christ has obtained a ministry as much more excellent as the covenant of which he is mediator is better and based upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first covenant had been faultless a place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>But finding fault with it he says, "The days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not in the manner of the covenant which I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not abide by my covenant and I ceased to care for them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts and I will be their God and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>They shall not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother saying, 'Know the Lord'; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In saying "new" he has pronounced the first covenant old. But what grows old and decadent is near to disappearance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>THE first covenant had regulations of worship and its holy building in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a Tent was erected, in the first part of which were the lampstand and the table and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>Behind the second curtain was the part called the Holy of Holies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>It had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant all covered with gold. In this was a golden jar with the manna and Aaron's rod that sprouted and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>Above it were cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of propitiation. Regarding these things it is not now possible to speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>But these things being thus arranged, the priests go constantly into the first part of the Tent, performing their services,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second part the High Priest alone goes once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins ignorantly committed by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit shows this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been made plain while the first Tent is standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>That is a symbol, for the time being, in accordance with which gifts and sacrifices are offered, though they cannot make the worshiper perfect in his conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>since they consist only of foods and drinks and various baths \'97 rules respecting the flesh, imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But when Christ came as High Priest of the good things that have come, he entered once for all through the greater and more perfect Tent not made by hands \'97 that is, not of this creation \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>and not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, into the holy place, and thereby found eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the defiled, makes them holy as regards purity of their flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit offered himself an unblemished sacrifice to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works for the service of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>For this reason he is the mediator of a better covenant that, a death having taken place for redemption from sins under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance promised to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a last will and testament the death of the testator must be put in evidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a will is valid in the case of the dead: it never has any force while the testator is living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Hence the first covenant was not introduced without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>When all the commands of the Law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled it on the book and on all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And the Tent and all the things used in worship he likewise sprinkled with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Almost everything is cleansed with blood, according to the Law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was necessary, then, that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a copy of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God in our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor was it to offer himself often, as the High Priest enters into the holy place every year with blood not his own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>then he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now, once for all, at the end of the ages, he has appeared to do away with sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is appointed for men once for all to die and after this comes judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so Christ was once for all offered to bear the sins of many and will appear the second time, apart from sin, to those who are looking for him, and bring them salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>FOR the Law with a shadow of the good things that are coming, but not the very likeness of the things, cannot, by the same sacrifices which they offer constantly every year, ever make perfect those who come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>since would they not have ceased offering them? Because the worshipers, once for all cleansed, would have had no consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in the sacrifices these are called to mind every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore on coming into the world he says, "Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire: a body thou hast prepared for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>Whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not delight in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, 'Here I have come \'97 in the roll of the book it is written of me \'97 to do thy will, O God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>He first says, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings thou dost not desire nor delight in," such as are offered according to the Law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>and then he says, "Here I have come to do thy will." He takes away the first to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By this "will" we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>Every priest stands daily doing service and offering many times the same sacrifices, although they never can take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this Priest after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, took his seat at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>for the future only waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he has forever perfected those who are made holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>The Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for after having said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their hearts and on their minds I will write them," he adds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>"and their sins and their law-breakings I will remember no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>But where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Since we have, then, brethren, confidence in entering the holy place through the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the new and living way which he has made for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us come with true hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful who has promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>and let us keep watch to incite one another to love and noble deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not neglecting to assemble yourselves, as some do, but encouraging one another, and so much the more, as you see the day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer any sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a dreadful expectation of doom and a fury of fire that will devour the opposers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Any one who sets aside a law of Moses dies without pity on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>Of how much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, who has thought the blood of the covenant, by which it was made holy, an unholy thing, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is dreadful to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>Remember the early days in which, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>at one time made a public spectacle by reproaches and distresses, at another time making common cause with those who were thus treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you even suffered with the prisoners and accepted the plundering of your property with joy, knowing that you had a better and enduring possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Do not, then, cast away your confidence, for it will have a great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>You have need of patience so that after doing the will of God you may gain the promised blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For yet "a little, very little, while, and he who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>My righteous man will live by faith; but if he shrinks back, my soul has no delight in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of those who shrink back and perish, but of those who have faith and will win their souls.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>FAITH is an assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>By this the men of old won their fame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that the worlds came into order at the word of God, so that what is now seen did not come out of things that are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, for which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts, and by it, though dead, he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was taken from the earth so that he did not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him. For before being taken he had this testimony that he had pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please him. For he who comes to God must have faith that he exists and that he becomes the rewarder of those who seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, after receiving a divine warning regarding things as yet unseen, reverently built an ark for the saving of his household. Thus he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham when called obeyed and came out into the place which he was to obtain for an inheritance. He came out not knowing where he was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he made his home in the promised land as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he was looking for the city that has the foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah received power to conceive a child even when past the natural time of life, since she thought him trustworthy who had given the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>And so from just one man, already dead in that respect, there sprang descendants "as the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand on the seashore innumerable."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith, not having obtained the promised blessings, but they saw them and greeted them afar and confessed that they were strangers and foreigners in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And if they had been thinking of that land from which they came they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they desire a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them \'97 of being called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, when at his end, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel and gave orders regarding his own bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses at his birth was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they did not fear the king's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>He chose rather to suffer hard-ship with the people of God than to enjoy the brief pleasure of sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>and he thought the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. For he was looking to the final reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; for he endured as if seeing him who is unseen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer might not touch their first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land; but the Egyptians when they tried to do so were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>By faith Rahab, the prostitute, did not perish with those who had refused to believe; because she had welcomed the spies with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>And what shall I say further? Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>who through faith struggled against kingdoms and subdued them, did deeds of righteousness, obtained promised blessings, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness grew strong, became mighty in war, turned back armies of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received back their dead by a resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to pay for liberation, in order to gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Still others had experience of mockings and floggings, yes, of chains and prisons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, afflicted, sawn in two, murdered with the sword. They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, distressed, maltreated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in caves and in holes in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>All these won God's approval by their faith. Yet they did not obtain the fulfillment of the promise.</verse>
