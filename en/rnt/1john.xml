  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>WHAT was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon and our hands touched \'97 it is about the Word of Life</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>
          <note>the Life appeared and we saw and testify to it and tell you of the Life eternal which was with the Father and appeared to us</note> \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>what wo have seen and heard we are telling you also, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>We are writing this that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>This is the message which we have heard from him and tell to you, God is light and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we say, "We have fellowship with him," and live in darkness, we lie and are not acting the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>If we live in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we say, "We have no sin," we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we say, "We have not sinned," we make him a liar and his message is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>MY children, I am writing this to you in order that you may not sin. Even if any one sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, who is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And he is an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but for those of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says, "I know him," and does not keep his commands, is a liar and truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God has been made perfect. By this we know that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who says that he is abiding in him ought himself to live as he lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Beloved, I am not writing a new command for you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again I am writing a new command, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says that he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother remains in the light and there is no stumbling block in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>He who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knows not where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven for his name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the Evil One. I have written to you, little children, because you have come to know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the message of God remains in you and you have conquered the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world nor the things that are in the world. If any one loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>for all that is in the world, the passions of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the show and pride of life, is not from the Father, but from the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world is passing away with its passions. But he who does the will of God endures forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would have continued with us. But they went out so that it might be plainly seen that not all are of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>You have an anointing from the Holy One and you all know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and know that no lie is from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>No one who denies the Son has the Father either. He who confesses the Son has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise that he has promised us \'97 the life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I am writing this to you in regard to those who are misleading you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>But as for you, the anointing that you have received from him remains in you and you have no need for any one to teach you, but as his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is no lie and as it has taught you, you must remain in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, remain in him so that if he appears we may have confidence and not shrink in shame from him at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one who does righteousness has been born of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>SEE what love the Father has bestowed on us that we should be called children of God. And so we are. The reason why tho world does not know us is that it did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, we are now children of God and it is not yet plain what we shall be. But we know that if he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every one who has this hope set upon Christ purifies himself just as Christ is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Every one who commits sin commits also lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>You know that Christ appeared to take away sins and in him there is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Whoever remains in him does not sin; whoever sins has not seen him nor known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one deceive you. He who is doing righteousness is righteous as Christ is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who is committing sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this the Son of God appeared \'97 to undo the works of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who has been born of God commits sin, for God's life-giving germ remains in him and he cannot continue sinning, because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this the children of God are plain to see, also the children of the Devil. Every one who is not doing righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we must love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>Not like Cain, who was of the Wicked One and killed his brother. And for what reason did he kill him? Because his own deeds were wicked and his brother's righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren. Whoever does not love remains in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Every one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has life eternal remaining in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we have come to know love \'97 that Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But if any one has this world's goods and sees his brother in need and shuts away his sympathies from him, how can the love of God remain in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>Let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>By this we shall know that we are of the truth and shall give confidence to our hearts in his presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>because if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us we have confidence toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his command \'97 to believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another as he has given us command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>He who keeps his commands remains in God and God remains in him. By this we know that God remains in us \'97 by the Spirit which he has given to us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>BELOVED, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits whether they are from God. For many false prophets have come out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this we know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and no spirit that does not confess Jesus is from God. This is the spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard is coming into the world and is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>But you are of God, little children, and have conquered them, because he who is in us is greater than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They belong to the world and for that reason they speak as the world speaks and the world listens to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us: whoever is not of God does not listen to us. In this way we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and every one who loves has been born of God and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He who does not love does not know God; for God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>By this the love of God to us was made plain: that God sent his only Son into the world so that we may have life through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love \'97 not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if God has so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has ever seen God. If we love one another God abides in us and his love is made perfect in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has imparted to us of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>We have seen and we bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>We have come to know and have put our trust in the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God and God remains in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>Thus love has been made perfect with us so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as God is we also are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has pain. He who fears has not been made perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love because he first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If any one says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>This command we have from him, that he who loves God shall love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>EVERY one who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and every one who loves the father who gave him life loves every one who has received life from that father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, our keeping his commands. And his commands are not burden-some,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>because all that is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is the conqueror of the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is he who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ. Not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>TEXT OMITTED</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>For there are three that bear witness, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we accept the testimony of men the testimony of God is greater; for this is God's testimony, that he has testified regarding his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony within himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar; because he has not believed the testimony which God has borne regarding his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>This is the testimony: that God has given to us life eternal and this life is in his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have life eternal, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>This is the confidence that we have toward him: that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that he hears us when we ask anything, we know that we obtain the things that we have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any one sees his brother committing a sin that is not deadly, he must ask and God will give him life for those who are committing sin that is not deadly. There is sin that is deadly. I do not say that he should pray in behalf of that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that is not deadly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that every one who has been born of God lives without sinning, but he who was born of God keeps him, and the Evil One does not lay hold of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are of God and the whole world lies in the Evil One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding to know him who is true, and we are in him who is true and in his Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, guard yourselves from idols.</verse>
