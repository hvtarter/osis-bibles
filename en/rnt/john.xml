  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the Light shone in the darkness, but the darkness did not understand it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There came a man, sent from God. His name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for testimony, to testify about the Light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true Light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world had come into being through him, yet the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own things, but his own men did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>All who received him \'97 to them he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>The Word became flesh and tented among us, and we looked upon his glory, glory as of an only son from a father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness to him and cried, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has become before me, for he was before me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For of his fullness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has interpreted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>This is the testimony of John when the Jews of Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said then, "Who are you? Let us have an answer to give to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, "I am 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>The men had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, "I baptize with water. In the midst of you stands one whom you do not know \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>the One who is coming after me \'97 for whom I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who has become before me, for he was before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I did not know him, but I knew that he was to be shown to Israel. For that reason I came baptizing with water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water \'97 he said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining, that is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I saw it and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again on the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and, looking at Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Jesus turned and looked at them as they followed, and said to them, "What do you wish?" They said to him, "Rabbi <note>which means, when translated, Teacher</note>, where are you staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, "Come and see." So they came and saw where he was staying, and stayed with him that day. It was then about four in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two that heard about Jesus from John and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah <note>which means, when translated, the Christ</note>!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, "You are Simon, the son of John. You shall be called Cephas"<note>which is in Greek, Peter, that is, Rock</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day Jesus decided to go away to Galilee, and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law and of whom the prophets wrote \'97 Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathanael said to him, "From Nazareth can there be anything good?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, "See, here is a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>He added, "Truly, truly, I tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>ON the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>When the wine ran short, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, "What have you to do with my work, woman? My hour has not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>There were standing there six stone water jars in accordance with the Jewish custom of purification, holding about twenty or thirty gallons apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." They filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then he said to them, "Dip out now and carry it to the Master of the feast." They carried it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>and when the Master of the feast tasted the water that had become wine, not knowing where it came from \'97 though the servants who had dipped out the water knew \'97 he called to the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, "Every man sets on first the fine wine, and when they have drunk freely he sets on the poorer. You have kept the fine wine till now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and displayed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this Jesus went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and there they stayed a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>Finding in the Temple courts the sellers of cattle and sheep and doves and the money-changers sitting there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>he made a whip of cords and drove them all from the courts \'97 all the sheep and the cattle, \'97 and he poured out the small coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>He said to those who were selling doves, "Take these things out. Do not make my Father's house a house of trade."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for thy house will devour me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews said to him, "What sign do you show us, since you act in this way?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them, "Demolish this Temple and in three days I will raise it again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews said, "It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and will you raise it in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>So when he arose from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>When he was in Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>but Jesus did not trust himself to them because he knew all men</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and had no need for any one to inform him about man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>THERE was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus by name, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus one night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a man is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter into his mother's womb a second time and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not wonder that I said, 'You must be born from above.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it will, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes. So is every one who is born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered him, "How can these things be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and do you not know these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I tell you, we are speaking of what we know, and we are witnessing to what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven \'97 the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that every one who believes in him may have life eternal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that every one who believes in him may not perish, but have life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>This is the condemnation, that Light has come into the world and men have loved darkness rather than Light, because their deeds were wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>Every one who is doing base things hates the Light and does not come to the Light, that his deeds may not be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who is doing the truth comes to the Light, that it may be plainly shown that his deeds have been done in union with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea and there he spent some time with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was abundant water there. People were constantly coming and being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John had not yet been thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>There arose a dispute between the disciples of John and a Jew about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan to whom you bore testimony \'97 see, he is baptizing and all are coming to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, "A man can assume nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves are witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is of the earth and he speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he has seen and heard, that he testifies to, yet no one accepts his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who accepts his testimony has set his seal that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>He whom God has sent speaks the word of God, for he does not give him the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has life eternal. He who disbelieves in the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>WHEN the Master knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>though Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judaea and went back again to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>He had to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob's well was there. Jesus, weary from his journey, sat just as he was on the well. It was about noon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman said to him, "How do you, a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>She said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where do you get the living water from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it, himself and his sons and his flocks?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst, but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water, flowing out into life eternal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, "Give me this water, so that I may not thirst nor come all the way here to draw."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He said to her, "Go call your husband and come back here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You say rightly that you have no husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>Five husbands you have had, and now the man you have is not your husband. You have told the truth about that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the proper place to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, "Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming \'97 yes, is now here \'97 when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeks for such worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. When he comes he will tell us all things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, "I am he, I who am talking to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Upon this came his disciples, and they wondered that he was talking with a woman. But no one said, "What do you want?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman left her pitcher and went away into the city and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>"Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is not this the Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They came out of the city and were on the way to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. A certain royal officer was there whose son was sick in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This man heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, and he came to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>There was a man there who had had an infirmity thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus saw this man lying there and perceiving that he had been there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to get well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered him, "I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled. While I am coming, some other man gets down before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your pallet and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>At once the man became well and took up his pallet and began walking. That day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>The Jews said to the man who had been cured, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not proper for you to carry your pallet."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the man who had made him well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>He answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>On this account the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only kept breaking the Sabbath, but even spoke of God as his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself; he does only what he sees the Father doing; whatever things he does, those the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him what he is doing, and he will show him greater works than these that you may wonder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>He has given him authority to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not wonder at this, because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>It was near the time for the Passover, the feast of the Jews.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, "Make the people recline on the ground." There was much grass in the place. So the men, about five thousand in number, reclined on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks and divided them to those who were reclining, and in the same way the fishes, as much as they wanted.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>THERE was a certain man sick \'97 Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was that Mary who anointed the Master with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent to Jesus, saying, "Master, he whom you love is sick."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard it he said, "This sickness is not to end in death, but is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>So when he heard that he was sick, he stayed where he was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then, after that, he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judaea again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, just now the Jews were trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He said this, and then he said to them, "Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>The disciples said to him, "Master, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jesus had spoken of his death. They thought that he was speaking of the repose of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said to them frankly, "Lazarus has died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and I am glad on your account that I was not there \'97 so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas, who is called Didymus <note>the Twin</note>, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too to die with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them regarding their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him. Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>And now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise at the resurrection on the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes in me even though he dies will live,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, "Yes, Master. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>Having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister, saying to her privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>She, when she heard it, rose quickly and went to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews who were with Mary in the house trying to comfort her, seeing her rise quickly and go out, followed thinking that she was going to the tomb to wail there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying, "Master, if you had been here my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he was indignant in spirit and disturbed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Master, come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews said, "See, how he loved him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>Some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have prevented this man from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, again indignant, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying on the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Master, he is already offensive, for he has been dead four days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee for hearing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I know that thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd that stand around I say it, that they may believe that thou didst send me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>After saying this he called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>Forth came the dead man, swathed feet and hands in grave-clothes and his face bound up in a handkerchief. Jesus said, "Loose him and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, "What are we doing? for this man is doing many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him alone in this way, all will believe in him and the Romans will come and destroy our place and nation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>One of them, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said to them, "You do not know anything</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you reason that it is better for you that one man should die for the people and so the whole nation escape destruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He did not say this of himself, but being High Priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God now scattered far and wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day they plotted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>So Jesus no more walked about openly among the Jews, but went away from there into the country near the wild lands, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>The Passover of the Jews was near and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were looking for Jesus and were saying to one another, as they stood in the Temple courts, "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that, if any one knew where he was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>SIX days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made a dinner for him. Martha waited on them, and Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary took a pound of pure nard perfume, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who was going to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>"Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred shillings and the money given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>He said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and having the purse used to pilfer what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus said, "Let her alone. It was hers to keep for the day of my preparation for the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>The poor you always have with you, but me you have not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not on account of Jesus alone, but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The high priests planned to kill Lazarus too,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because many of the Jews on account of him went and believed in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day the great crowd which had come to the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, "God save him! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord \'97 the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Jesus, finding a young ass, sat on it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>"Fear not, daughter of Zion! Behold, your King comes, sitting on the foal of an ass!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things his disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of him and had been done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The people that were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead were bearing witness to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this reason the crowd went to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees said among themselves, "You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone off after him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>There were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew came with Philip and they told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life destroys it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any one is serving me, let him follow me and where I am there my servant shall be. If any one is serving me, him my Father will honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this I have come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name!" There came a voice from heaven, "I have glorified it and will again glorify it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd that was standing there and heard said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel spoke to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus said, "This voice came, not on my account, but for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the Ruler of this world will be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This he said indicating by what death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus said to them, "A little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness may not overtake you. He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so as to become sons of Light." Jesus said these things and then went away and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But, though he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>so that the word of Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled. Isaiah said, "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>"He has blinded their eyes and dulled their mind so that they may not see with their eyes nor understand with their mind and repent so that I should heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and he spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, even of the rulers many did believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, in order not to be expelled from the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Jesus cried out, "He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and he who looks upon me looks upon him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a Light into the world that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If any one hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge. The message that I have spoken \'97 that will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>But he who sent me \'97 the Father himself \'97 has given me a command what I am to say and what I am to speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>and I know that his command is life eternal. So what I am speaking I am speaking just as the Father has told me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed has no need to be washed, except his feet, but is all clean. And you are clean, though not all."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them, "I find no crime in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered, "We have a law and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard that, he was more alarmed</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and went into the Castle and said to Jesus, "Where do you come from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate said to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, "You would not have any authority over me if it were not given you from above. For this reason he who delivered me to you has a greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>After this, Pilate kept trying to release him, but the Jews shouted, "If you let this man go you are not a friend of Caesar. Every one who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, on hearing these words, brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat in the place called the Mosaic Pavement \'97 in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>It was the Preparation Day of the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, "See your king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>They shouted, "Away with him, away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your king?" The high priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and laid on him his cross and went out to what is called Skull Place \'97 in Hebrew, Golgotha \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him. And with him they crucified two others, one on this side and one on that, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate wrote a sign and put it up on the cross. It was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes and made four parts, a part to each soldier, and there was his tunic besides. The tunic was seamless, woven from the top entire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots who shall have it." This was so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "They parted my garments among them and on my clothing they cast lots." The soldiers did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>There were standing beside the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, "Woman, there is your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, "There is your mother." From that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that now all things had been completed, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled said, "I am thirsty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A pitcher was standing there full of sour wine. Putting a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop stem, they raised it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, "It is finished," and bowing his head gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, because it was Preparation Day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for that Sabbath was a great day, requested Pilate to have their legs broken to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But, coming to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with his spear pierced his side and immediately there came forth blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>He who saw it has borne witness and his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth in order that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of him shall not be broken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they have pierced."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate permission to carry away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted it. So he came and carried his body away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus, the man who came to him at first by night, came also bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the custom of the Jews in preparing for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>There was in the place where he had been crucified a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>ON the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been taken from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>She ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Master from the tomb and we do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Simon Peter and the other disciple went out and made their way to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They were both running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping he saw the linen cloths lying; but he did not enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb and looked at the linen cloths lying</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the handkerchief that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place apart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple who had come first to the tomb entered, and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For they did not yet know the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>Mary was standing by the tomb outside weeping. As she wept she stooped and looked into the tomb</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have carried away my Master and I do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>After saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing, but did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?" She, thinking that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have removed him, tell me where you have laid him and I will take him away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" <note>that is, Teacher</note>.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brethren and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, "I have seen the Master," and she told that he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>In the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors had been closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy on seeing the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>He said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father sent me forth so I am sending you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus <note>the Twin</note>, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples said to him, "We have seen the Master." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>After eight days the disciples were again within and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood in the midst and said, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, "Reach your finger here. Here are my hands. Reach your hand and put it into my side, and become not faithless, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Jesus did before the disciples many other signs which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life through his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>AFTER this, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Lake of Tiberias. He showed himself in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus <note>the Twin</note>, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said, "We will go along with you." They went out and got into a boat, but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples, however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." They cast, and now they could not draw it in for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Master!" Simon Peter, on hearing that it was the Master, girded around him his blouse, for he was naked, and threw himself into the lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>The other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from land \'97 about a hundred yards \'97 dragging the netful of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they had gotten out on land, they saw a fire of coals and fish laid on it and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter got into the boat and drew the net to land full of big fishes \'97 a hundred and fifty-three \'97 and though there were so many the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said, "Come, take break-fast." No one of the disciples dared to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came and took bread and gave to them, and fish in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Master, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Shepherd my sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Master, you know all things. You know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked about wherever you wished. When you are old, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he said, indicating the kind of death by which he would glorify God. After saying this he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, following. <note>It was he who at the supper had leaned on Jesus' breast and said, "Lord, who is it that will betray you? "</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "Master, what shall this man do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you? You must follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>So the report went out among the brethren that that disciple was not to die. But Jesus did not say to Peter that he would not die, but, "If I choose to have him stay until I come, what is that to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who witnesses to these things and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these are written, every one, I do not think that the world itself will have room for the books when written.</verse>
