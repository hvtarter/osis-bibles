  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Jas.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.1'>JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the Twelve Tribes which are scattered in foreign lands: Greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.2'>Think it all joy, my brethren, when you fall into all sorts of trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.3'>since you know that the testing of your faith brings out endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.4'>Let endurance do its complete work, that you may be complete and perfect, lacking in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.5'>If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him ask it from God, who gives to all freely without reproaching, and it will be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.6'>But he must ask in faith with never a doubt. For he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.7'>For that man must not think that he will obtain anything from the Lord \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.8'>a two-minded man unsteady in all his ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.9'>Let the lowly brother glory in his high station,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.10'>and let the rich brother glory in his lowly station, for he will pass away like a flower of the grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.11'>For the sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the grass, and the flower of it falls and the beauty of its face perishes. So shall the rich man wither in his pursuits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.12'>Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has been tested he will gain the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.13'>No one must say when tempted, "My temptation comes from God." For God cannot be tempted by evil, and he tempts no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.14'>Every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own passions and enticed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.15'>Then when passion has conceived it gives birth to sin, and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.16'>Make no mistake, my beloved brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.17'>every good gift and every perfect boon is from above; it descends from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or shadow caused by turning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.18'>Of his own will he made us his children through the message of truth, so that we might be a sort of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.19'>I wish you to know this, my beloved brethren: Every man must be quick to hear, but slow to speak, slow to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.20'>For a man's anger does not work out God's righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.21'>So lay aside all that is vile and all that remains of malice, and receive with gentleness the implanted message which can save your souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.22'>Become doers of the message and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.23'>For if one is a hearer of the message and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.24'>He looks at himself and is gone, and immediately forgets what sort of man he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.25'>But he who looks earnestly into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do so, and becomes not a forgetful hearer but a doer of work \'97 that man will be blessed in what he does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.26'>If any one thinks himself religious while he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, that man's religion is worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.1.27'>Pure and stainless religion in the sight of God the Father is to visit orphans and widows in their trouble and to keep one's self unspotted from the world.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.1'>MY brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality for persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.2'>For if there comes into your assembly a man with gold rings and in fine clothes, and there comes in a poor man in soiled clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.3'>and you look up to the man who is wearing the fine clothes and say, "Take this good seat," and say to the poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit under my footstool,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.4'>are you not making distinctions in your own minds and have you not become judges with wicked thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brethren, did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.6'>But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you before courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.7'>Do they not speak profanely of the noble name by which you are called?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.8'>If you keep the royal law according to the Scripture, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," you do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.9'>But if you have partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as law-breakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.10'>For he who keeps the whole law, but stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.11'>For he who said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," said also, "Thou shalt not commit murder." If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a law-breaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.12'>So speak and so act as those who are soon to be judged by a law of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.13'>For judgment is merciless to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.14'>Of what use is it, my brethren, for any one to say that he has faith, if he has not works? Can faith save him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.15'>If a brother or sister is naked and lacks food for the day</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.16'>and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and fed," but you do not give them what the body needs, what is the good of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.17'>Just so faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.18'>But some one will say, "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.19'>You have faith that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons have that faith, and they shudder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.20'>Are you willing to learn, O vacant-minded man, that faith without works is useless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.21'>Was not Abraham, our father, pronounced righteous because of works when he laid Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.22'>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was made perfect</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.23'>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham had faith in God and it was credited to him for righteousness" and he was called "God's friend."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.24'>You see that a man is pronounced righteous because of works and not because of faith alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.25'>In the same way was not Rahab, the prostitute, pronounced righteous because of works when she had received the messengers and sent them out by a different road?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.2.26'>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.1'>DO not, many of you, become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we will receive severer judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.2'>For in many ways we all stumble. If any one never stumbles in his talk, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also the whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.3'>If we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we turn about their whole bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.4'>See the ships; great as they are and driven by violent winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the desire of the helmsman chooses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.5'>Just so the tongue is a small member, but boasts of great things. Think how small a fire may be and yet how vast the forest that it may set ablaze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.6'>And the tongue is a fire, a world of wickedness. The tongue stands among our members as that which spots the whole body and sets on fire the wheel of nature and is itself set on fire by Gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.7'>For every kind of wild beasts and birds and reptiles and animals from the sea is tamed and has been tamed by human kind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.8'>but the tongue no man is able to tame. It is a restless evil; it is full of deadly poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.9'>With it we bless the Lord our Father and with it we curse the men who are made in the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.10'>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. This, my brethren, should not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.11'>Does a spring pour out from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.12'>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a vine figs? No more can salt water yield fresh water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.13'>Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show out of the noble life that he lives his works in wise gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.14'>But if you have bitter jealousy and party-spirit in your hearts, do not boast and falsely contradict the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.15'>This wisdom does not come down from on high, but is earthly, animal, demoniacal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.16'>For where jealousy and party-spirit are, there is confusion and every base affair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.17'>But the wisdom from on high is first pure, then peaceable, fair-minded, easily persuaded, full of compassion and good fruits, impartial, sincere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.3.18'>The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.1'>WHENCE come wars and whence come strifes among you? Is it not from your pleasures which carry on war in your members?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.2'>You long for something and do not have it. You murder and envy and cannot obtain it. You battle and war. You do not have, because of your not asking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.3'>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wickedly to waste it on your pleasures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.4'>You adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever chooses to be a friend to the world stands as an enemy of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.5'>Do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose? Does the Spirit which he made dwell in us long enviously?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.6'>But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.7'>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the Devil and he will flee from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.8'>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Make your hands clean, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.9'>Be sorrowful and mourn and lament. Let your laughter be turned into grief and your gladness into gloom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.10'>Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.11'>Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.12'>One is the Lawgiver and Judge \'97 he who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you, to judge your neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.13'>Come, now, you who say, "To-day or to-morrow we will go to such a city and spend a year and do business and make money,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.14'>though you do not know what your life will be like on the morrow. For you are a vapor that appears for a little while and then disappears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.15'>You should rather say, "If the Lord wills it, we shall live and do this or that."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.16'>But now you glory in bragging. All such glorying is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.4.17'>If any one, then, knows how to do good and is not doing it, he is committing sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jas.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>COME, now, you rich men, wail and lament over the miseries that are coming upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>your gold and silver are rusted over and the rust on them will be an evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>You have laid up treasures in the last days. See, the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, fraudulently kept back by you, call aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have come into the ears of the Lord of armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You have lived luxuriously in the land and have given yourselves up to pleasure. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned, you have murdered, the righteous; he does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the ground and is patient over it until he receives the early and the late rains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.8'>You too must be patient. Keep your hearts steadfast, for the coming of the Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.9'>Do not fret at one another, brethren, and then you will not be judged. The Judge is standing before your doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>Take, brethren, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord as an example of patience in suffering evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>We call them blessed because they endured. You have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord's dealings with him, that the Lord is very tender and compassionate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>Above all things, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath. Let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Is any one of you suffering hardship? Let him pray. Is any one cheerful? Let him sing with the harp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.14'>Is any one of you sick? Let him call in the elders of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him with olive oil in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.15'>The prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.16'>Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another in order to be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man has great power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.17'>Elijah was a man of the same weaknesses as ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.18'>Then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the land brought forth its fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.19'>My brethren, if one of you strays from the truth and any one brings him back,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.20'>I wish you to know that he who brings back a sinner from his wanderings will save his soul from death and will hide a host of sins.</verse>
