      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>PAULOS and Timotheus, servants of Jeshu the Meshiha, to all the saints who are in Jeshu Meshiha at Philipos, with the presbyters and deacons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Grace be with you and peace from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I offer thanks unto Aloha upon the remembrance of you constantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>in all my prayers on your behalf; and while rejoicing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>I pray, for your fellowship which is in the gospel from the first day until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>because I am confident of this, that he who hath begun good workings in you will himself make perfect until the day of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>For so it is right for me to think concerning you all, because you are laid up in my heart; and in my bonds, and in the defence of the truth of the gospel, you are partakers with me in grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For Aloha is my witness how I love you with the bowels of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And this I pray, that your love may still increase and abound in knowledge and in all spiritual understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>that you may distinguish those things that are proper, and may be pure and without offence in the day of the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>and filled with the fruits of righteousness which are in Jeshu Meshiha, to the glory and the honour of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>BUT I wish you to know, my brethren, that my business tendeth the more to the forwarding of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>For so also my bonds are manifest for the Meshiha in the whole palace, and unto all besides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And a multitude of brethren who are in our Lord are strengthened on account of my bonds, and have dared the more fearlessly to speak the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some preach from envy and contention, but some from good-will,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>and in the love of the Meshiha; for they know that for the defence of the gospel I am appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But those who preach the Meshiha from contention do it not sincerely, but think to add affliction to my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>Yet in this I have rejoiced, and do rejoice, that in every way, if for an occasion, or if in truth, the Meshiha shall be preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that these things shall be found unto my life by your prayers, and by the gift of the Spirit of Jeshu Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>even as I hope and expect, that in nothing I shall be confounded, but manifestly, as at all times, so also now, the Meshiha shall be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For my life is the Meshiha; and if I die, it is gain to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But if in this life of the flesh there be also fruit to me from my works, I know not what to choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>For these two straiten me. I desire to be set free, that I might be with the Meshiha, and this is greatly preferable to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>but also to remain in my body is the thing which constraineth me on your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>For I know this confidently, that I am to remain and tarry for your joy and for the increase of your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>that when I come again to you, your glorying which is in Jeshu Meshiha alone shall abound in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>As it becometh the gospel of the Meshiha, so have your conversation; that if coming I see you, or absent, I may hear of you, that you stand in one spirit and in one soul, conquering together for the faith of the gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>in nothing moved by them who stand against us, to the forthshowing of their perdition, and of our salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>And this from Aloha hath been given to you, not only believing to believe in the Meshiha, but also for his sake to suffer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>and to sustain a conflict, as you have seen in me, and now hear concerning me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>IF, therefore, you have consolation in the Meshiha, and if there be comfort in love, and if communion of the Spirit, and if compassions and mercies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>complete my gladness by having one sentiment and one love, and one soul and one mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>And do nothing in contention or vainglorying, but in meekness of mind let a man consider his neighbour as better than himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>And let no one care for himself (only), but every one for his neighbour also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>And feel this in yourselves, which Jeshu the Meshiha (did) also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, when he was in the form of Aloha, considered this not to be robbery, (this, namely,) that he was the co-equal of Aloha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>yet emptied he himself, and took the form of a servant, and was made in the form of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and in fashion was found as a man, and humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, but the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Wherefore also Aloha greatly exalted him, and gave him a name that is more excellent than all names,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jeshu every knee should kneel, of those in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>and that every tongue should confess that Jeshu the Meshiha is the Lord, to the glory of Aloha his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>WHEREFORE, my beloved, as you have all time obeyed, not while I am near you only, but now that I am far from you, the more with fear and trembling work the work of your salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for Aloha himself effectuates in you also to will, also to do, the thing which you will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do every thing without murmuring and without division;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may be perfect and without spot, as the pure children of Aloha, who dwell in a generation depraved and perverse; and be manifest among them as luminaries in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>to be unto them for a place of salvation, for my exultation in the day of the Meshiha, that I may not have run in vain, nor laboured to no purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But, also, offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad, and rejoice with you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>so also you be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in our Lord Jeshu to send Timotheos to you soon, that I also may have quietness when I learn concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no other who is so as my (own) soul, who will diligently take care for yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all are seeking what is theirs, and not what is of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But the proof of this you know, that as a son with his father, so hath he wrought with me in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him, therefore, I hope to send to you speedily, when I shall have seen what with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I confide on my Lord, that I also speedily shall come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But now the matter hath pressed me to send to you the brother Epaphroditos, who is a helper and labourer with me, but your messenger and minister to my necessity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>for he desired to see you all, and was anxious, because he knew that you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Yes, he was sick, unto death; but Aloha had mercy upon him; but not upon him only, but upon me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Urgently, therefore, have I sent him to you, that when you have seen him again you may rejoice, and that I may have a little breathing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him, then, in the Lord with all joy; and those who are such, hold in estimation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of the Meshiha he had come nigh unto death, and was disregardful of his life, that he might accomplish that which you had wanted in the service which concerned me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>HENCEFORTH, my brethren, rejoice in our Lord. To write the very same (things) to you, to me is not weariness, because they make you cautious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the cutting of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For the circumcision are we, who serve Aloha in the spirit, and glory in Jeshu the Meshiha, and confide not on the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Yet I may have confidence on the flesh. For if any one consider that his confidence is in the flesh, I more than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised the son of eight days, of the family of Israel, of the tribe of Benyomin, Ebroia of Ebroyee; in the law, Pharisha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>in zeal, a persecutor of the church; and in the righteousness of the law, without fault have I been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But these things which were my gain, I have reckoned loss for the Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>and I also (still) reckon them all loss, for the grandeur of the knowledge of Jeshu Meshiha my Lord; for whose sake I have lost all things, and have reckoned as dung, that the Meshiha I may gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is by the faith of the Meshiha, which is righteousness that is from Aloha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>that in it I may know Jeshu, and the power of his resurrection, and have fellowship in his sufferings, and be conformed into his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>that any how I may be able to come to the resurrection which is from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>I have not yet received, nor (am I) yet perfected; but I run, that so I may lay hold on that for the sake of which Jeshu the Meshiha hath laid hold on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>MY brethren, I think not concerning myself that I have laid hold (of the final prize); but one (thing) I know, that what is behind me I forget, and to that which is before me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I stretch, and run towards the sign, to obtain the victory of the high vocation of Aloha by Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let those, then, who are mature consider these things; and if otherwise you consider, this also will Aloha reveal to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, that to this we may attain, in one way let us proceed, and with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Be like me, my brethren, and consider them who so walk according to the pattern you have seen in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For there are many who walk otherwise, of whom many times I have told you, but now weeping I tell you, they are adversaries of the cross of the Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>they, whose end is perdition, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is their shame; they, whose mind is in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>But our employment is in heaven, and from thence we expect the Saviour, our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will change the body of our abasement to make (it) in the fashion of his glorious body, according to his great power, by which all is subjected unto him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and tenderly-regarded, my joy and my crown, so stand in our Lord, my beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>Of Evhodia I beseech, and of Syntika, that one mind they have in our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Also of thee I beseech, my true yokefellow, to be helpful to those who are labouring with me in the gospel, with Klimis, and with the rest of my helpers, whose names are written in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in our Lord in all time, and again I say, Rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>And let your meekness be known unto every man: our Lord is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>For nothing be anxious; but in all time, with prayer and with supplication, let your requests be made known before Aloha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And the peace of Aloha, which is greater than all knowledge, shall keep your hearts and your minds, through Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>FINALLY, my brethren, those (things) which are true, and those which are honest, and those which are just, and those which are pure, and those which are lovely, and those which are laudable, and those (which are) works of praise and of celebration, these consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>These which you have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these perform; and the God of peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>But greatly do I rejoice in our Lord, that you have begun to care (again) for me, as also you were careful, but you have not had ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>But I have not spoken because I have had need; for I have learned to make sufficient to me that which I have had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know (how) to be abased, I know also how to abound in all; and in every thing I am trained with sufficiency and with hunger, with abundance and with destitution:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>for every thing I am empowered through the Meshiha who strengtheneth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless, you have done well to communicate unto my afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Know also, you Philipisoyee, that in the commencement of the gospel, when I went forth from Makedunia, not one of the churches communicated to me in the account of receiving and giving, but you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>For also to Thessalonika one time and twice to my necessity you sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not because I seek the gift, but I seek that fruit may multiply unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have received every thing, I abound; and am full; and I have accepted all that you sent me by Epaphroditos, a sweet fragrance and a sacrifice, acceptable, which pleaseth Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God shall supply all your necessity, according to his riches in the glory of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>To Aloha our Father be praise and glory to the age of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Ask for the peace of all the saints who are in Jeshu the Meshiha. The brethren who are with me ask for your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints ask for your peace, especially those who are of the house of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The grace of our Lord Jeshu the Meshiha be with you all. Amen.</verse>
