      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>PAULOS the called, and the apostle of Jeshu Meshiha by the will of Aloha, and Sosthenis a brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of Aloha which is in Kurinthos, the called, and the saints who in Jeshu Meshiha are sanctified; and to all them who invoke the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha in every place, theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace be with you and peace from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to Aloha at all times on your behalf for the grace of Aloha which is given to you through Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>because in every thing you are enriched in him in all utterance and in all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>according to the testimony of the Meshiha, which is confirmed in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>That you may not be deficient in one of his gifts, but be expecting the revelation of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will confirm you to the end, that you may be without fault in the day of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>Faithful is Aloha, by whom you have been called to the fellowship of his Son Jeshu Meshiha our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>But I beseech of you, my brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that you have all one doctrine, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfect in one mind and one sentiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For they of the house of KloÃ« have sent to me concerning you, my brethren, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>For this I say, that there are some of you who say, I am of Paulos; and some who say, I am of Apollo; and some who say, I am of Kipha; and some who say, I am of the Meshiha!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is the Meshiha divided? Or was Paulos crucified for you? Or in the name of Paulos were you baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank Aloha that no man of you I have baptized, but only Krispos and Gaios;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any man should say, that in my name I have baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>But I baptized also the house of Estepana; beyond (these) I know not that any other man I have baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For the Meshiha sent me not to baptize, but to preach; not with the wisdom of words, lest the cross of the Meshiha should be nullified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>FOR the doctrine of the cross to those who perish is foolishness, but to us who are saved it is the power of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, And I will take away the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Or where is the disputer of this world? Hath not . Aloha made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For inasmuch as in the wisdom of Aloha, the world by wisdom hath not known Aloha, it hath pleased Aloha, by the foolishness of preaching, to save them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For the Jihudoyee demand signs, and the Aramoyee require wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach the Meshiha crucified, a scandal to the Jihudoyee, and to the Aramoyee foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to them who are called, Jihudoyee and Aramoyee, the Meshiha is the power of Aloha, and the wisdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of Aloha is wiser than men, and the weakness of Aloha is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see also your calling, my brethren, that not many among you are wise after the flesh, and not many among you are powerful, and not many among you are of noble birth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but Aloha hath chosen the simple of the world, to shame the wise, and he hath chosen the weak of the world, to shame the mighty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>and he hath chosen those of low birth in the world, and the outcasts, and those who are nothing, to bring to nothing those who are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that no flesh may boast before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But you are of him in Jeshu Meshiha, who hath been made unto us wisdom, of Aloha, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>according as it is written, He who boasteth, in the Lord let him boast.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, my brethren, when I came to you, not with grandeur of speech, nor with wisdom, did I evangelize to you the mystery of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>And I considered myself among you as not knowing any thing unless Jeshu Meshiha, and him also as crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I in much fear and trembling was with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasion of the words of wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith might not be through the wisdom of men, but through the power of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>But we speak wisdom among the perfect: not the wisdom of this world, nor the authorities of this world, which are abolished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the wisdom of Aloha in the mystery which was hidden, and which Aloha predetermined from before the worlds unto our glorification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which not one of the authorities of this world hath known; for if they had known it, the Lord of glory they would not have crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, The eye hath not seen, Nor the ear heard, Nor the heart of man hath risen (to), That which Aloha hath prepared for those who love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>BUT unto us hath Aloha revealed, by his Spirit. For the Spirit all things searcheth, also the depths of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knoweth what is in man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? so also that which is in Aloha man knoweth not, but only the Spirit of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>But we not the spirit of this world have received, but the Spirit who is from Aloha, that we might know that the gifts from Aloha are given unto us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which also we speak, not with the learning of words of wisdom of men, but with the learning of the Spirit; and with spirituals the spirituals we compare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>For the man who is animal receiveth not spirituals, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot know them, because they by the Spirit are judged of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>but the spiritual judgeth of every thing, and he of man is not judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord to teach him? But we have the mind of the Meshiha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>AND I, my brethren, could not speak with you as with the spiritual, but as with the carnal, and as with babes in the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I have sustained you with milk, and have not given you meat; for as yet you could not, nor can you now, (bear it).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For as yet you are in the flesh. For while there are among you envy and contentions and divisions, are you not carnal, and walking in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while some of you say, I am of Paulos, and another, I am of Apollo, are you not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>For who is Paulos, or who Apollo, but ministers by whom you have believed and each as the Lord gave to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, and Apollo watered, but Aloha made to increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>He then who planteth is not any thing nor he who watereth; but Aloha who maketh to increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>But he who planteth and he who watereth are one, (and) each according to his labour his recompence receiveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For with Aloha we work; and the work of Aloha and the edifice of Aloha are you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>And according to the grace of Aloha which is given to me, I have laid the foundation as a wise architect; but another hath built upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>But let every man beware how he buildeth upon it. For another foundation besides this which is laid no man can lay, (that, namely,) which is Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>And if any man build upon this foundation gold, or silver, or precious stones; or wood, or hay, or stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>the work of every one shall be revealed, for that day shall reveal it; for by the fire shall it be revealed, and the work of every man as it is the fire shall distinguish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>And he whose work which he builded shall abide, will receive his recompense;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>and he whose work shall be burned, shall fail; but he (himself) shall be rescued, but so as from fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>KNOW YOU not that you are the temple of Aloha, and (that) the Spirit of Aloha inhabiteth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>Whoso destroyeth the temple of Aloha, him will Aloha destroy for the temple of Aloha is holy, which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself. Whoever among you supposeth himself wise in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is folly with Aloha; for it is written, He hath taken the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>On this account let no one boast in men: for every thing is yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paulos, or Apolo, or Kipha, or the world, or life, or death, or things standing, or things to be; every thing is yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are of the Meshiha, and the Meshiha of Aloha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Thus let us be accounted of you as ministers of the Meshiha, and stewards of the mysteries of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>So now is it required of a steward that he be one found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a little thing to be Judged by you, or by any man; neither do I judge myself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>for of nothing in myself am I conscious; but not by this am I justified, but my judge is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore, do not judge before the time, until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the thoughts of hearts. Then will there be praise to each man from Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>BUT these things, my brethren, for your sakes I have applied to the person of myself and of Apolo, that through us you may learn not to think of us beyond what is written; and that one above his neighbour may not be exalted on account of any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who distinguisheth thee? Or, what hast thou which thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou boast as if thou hadst not received?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Now you are satiated, and are rich, and without us have reigned. But I would that you did reign, that we might also reign with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>But I consider that us, the apostles, Aloha hath set last, as unto death, to be a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for the sake of the Meshiha, but we are wise in the Meshiha; we are the weak, but you are the mighty; you are glorified, and we abased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Until this hour we hunger and thirst, we are naked and beaten and have no fixed dwelling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we labour, working with our hands. They revile us, and we bless; they persecute us, and we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>they maltreat us, and we pray for them; as the refuse of the world are we made and the execration of all men until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not as to shame you write I these things, but as my beloved children I admonish (you).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For if you have ten thousand teachers in the Meshiha, yet not many fathers; for in Jeshu Meshiha I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I entreat then of you that you be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>WHEREFORE I have sent to you Timotheos, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, that he may remind you of my ways in the Meshiha, according to that which I teach in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>But as if I were not coming to you, some of you are inflated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But if the Lord will, quickly come I unto you; and I will know not the words of them who exalt themselves, but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of Aloha is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>How are you willing? with a rod shall I come to you, or with love and with the spirit of kindliness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>Fornication is commonly reported among you; and such fornication as is not heard among the Heathens, that the son should take the wife of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are inflated; but should you not rather sit in grief that he who hath wrought this work might be put away from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>But I, while distant from you in body, am near you in spirit, and now judge, as if near you, him who hath done this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>that in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha all of you be assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>and you deliver this (man) to Satana for the destruction of his body, that in spirit he may be saved in the day of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>MY brethren, your boasting is not seemly. Know you not that a little leaven the whole mass leaveneth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge from you the old leaven, that you may be a new mass; so that you may be (as) unleavened bread. For our Pascha is the Meshiha, who hath been slain for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore, let us perform the festival, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of wickedness and animosity, but with the unleavened bread of purity and of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I have written to you by epistle, not to be mixed with fornicators;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>but I do not say with fornicators who are in this world, nor speak I concerning the covetous, or the rapacious, or the servers of idols; otherwise you would be obligated from the world also to go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But this which I have written to you, Be not mixed, (is,) If any one who is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or a worshipper of idols, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or rapacious, with one who is such as he not to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what had I to judge those who are without? But you judge those who are within;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>but those who are without, Aloha judgeth: and put away the wicked one from among you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>DARE any of you, having a suit with his brother, to litigate before the evil, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Or know you not that the saints shall judge the world? And if the world by you is judged, are you not worthy to judge small matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know you not that you are to judge angels? How much more those (matters) which are of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>But if you have matters to be judged regarding the world, those who are little-esteemed in the church make you to sit in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>But to your reproach am I to say to you, So there is not among you even one wise man, who is able to adjust between a brother and his brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But a brother with his brother litigates, and, moreover, before those who are unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Now, therefore, you make yourselves guilty while you have litigation one with another. For why do you not bear injury? and why do you not suffer fraud?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you injure, and you defraud, also your brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or, know you not that the unjust the kingdom of Aloha cannot inherit? Do not err; neither fornicators, nor the servers of idols, nor adulterers, nor corrupters, nor liers with men, nor the oppressive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor the rapacious, the kingdom of Aloha can inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And these were some of you but you are washed, and sanctified, and justified in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>ALL (food) is lawful to me, but all is not expedient for me. All is lawful to me, but over me no one shall have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the belly, and the belly for food; but Aloha will abolish them both. But the body was not for fornication, but for our Lord, and our Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And Aloha hath raised up our Lord, and us will raise by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know you not that your bodies are members of the Meshiha? Shall one take a member of the Meshiha to make it a member of a harlot? Never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Know you not that whosoever attacheth to a harlot is one body? For it is said, The two shall be one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But, he who attacheth to our Lord is with him one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee from fornication: for every sin which a man committeth is without his body; but he who committeth fornication against his own body sinneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Or, know you not that your body is the temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who dwelleth in you, (even) Him whom you have received from Aloha? And you are not your own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you are bought with the price; therefore glorify Aloha in your body and in your spirit, which are of Aloha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>BUT concerning those (questions) of which you wrote to me, It is well for a man unto a woman not to come nigh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>but, because of fornication, let a man take his wife, and let a woman take her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>And let a man render the love that is due unto his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>so also the wife to her husband. For the wife hath not authority over her body, but the husband; so also the man hath not authority over his body, but his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud not then one the other, unless you both agree for a time, that you may humble yourselves by fasting and by prayer; and return again unto the same will, that Satana may not tempt you on account of the desire of your bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this I speak as to the infirm; (and) not from commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I would that all men were as I am, in chastity. But every man hath the gift given to him from Aloha, this one thus, and the other thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to those who have no wives, and to the widows, that it is expedient for them to remain as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>Yet, if they persevere not, they should marry; for it is better to take a wife than to burn with concupiscence.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>But this for your own profit speak I; not to throw a snare over you, but that you may be constant towards your Lord in a comely manner, while not thoughtful of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For the body also is not one member, but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>For if the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body itself, would it therefore not be of the body itself?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>But if all were one member, where would be the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now the members are many, but the body one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>The eye is not able to say to the hand, Thou art not needful to me; nor is the hand able to say to the feet, You are not needful to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But those members which are considered to be feeble, of them is the more especial need;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>But those members that are honourable in us have no need of adornment: but Aloha hath contempered the body, and given the more honour to the member which is inconsiderable;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>that there should be no divisions in the body, but all the members equally one of the other should have care:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>as that when one member shall be diseased, all may suffer; and if one member be glorified, all the members may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>But you are the body of the Meshiha, and members in your place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>FOR Aloha hath placed in the church, first, apostles; after them, prophets; after them, teachers; after them, workers of miracles; after them, gifts of healing, and helpers, and leaders, and kinds of tongues.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, as a child I spake, and as a child I thought, and as a child I reasoned; but when I had become a man I abolished these things of childhood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow (then) after love, and be emulous of the gifts of the Spirit, but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For whoever speaketh in a tongue speaketh not to men but to Aloha; for man heareth nothing that he speaketh but in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesieth speaketh to men, edification and encouragement and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaketh in a tongue himself edifieth, and he who prophesieth the church edifieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>But I would that all of you could speak with tongues, but especially that you could prophesy. For greater is he who prophesieth than he who speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret. But if he interpret, he edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>And now, my brethren, if I come to you and speak with you in tongues, what do I profit you, unless I speak with you, or by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>For those also which have no life in them, and give voice, whether pipe or harp, if distinction be not made between a tone and its fellow, how can it be known what is sung, or what is played?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And if the trumpet call a voice which is not distinguished, who will prepare for the battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So you also, if you speak the word in a tongue, and there be no interpretation, how will it be known what you say? Will you not be as if speaking with the air?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>For, behold, there are many kinds of tongues in the world, and not one of them hath not signification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>but if I do not know the power of the voice, I become as a barbarian to him who speaks, and he also who speaks is a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also you, while you are emulous of the gifts of the Spirit for the edification of the church, seek that you may excel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>And let him who speaketh with tongues pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my mind is without fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What shall I do then? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my mind; and I will sing with my spirit, and I will sing with my mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he who filleth the place of the unlearned say Amen to thy thanksgiving? for he knoweth not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou blessest well, but thy neighbour is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I praise Aloha that more than all of you I speak with tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that others also may learn, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>MY brethren, be not children in your minds, but in evils be you babes, and in your minds be perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, In a strange language and in another tongue Will I speak with this people; Yet so will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Hence, tongues are appointed for a sign, not to the believing, but to those who believe not: but prophecy, not for those who believe not, but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If then all the church be assembled, and all of you speak with tongues, and the ignorant, or those who believe not enter, will they not say you are insane?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>And if all should prophesy, and there come in to you the ignorant, or of those who believe not, he is convicted by you all, and reproved by you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>and the secrets of his heart are revealed; and then will he fall upon his face and worship Aloha, and say, Truly Aloha is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>I say then, my brethren, that when you are assembled, if any one of you hath a psalm, let him speak; and (so too) he who hath doctrine, and he who hath a revelation, and he who hath a tongue, and he who hath the interpretation: let all be done unto edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>And if with a tongue any one speak, two shall speak, or at most three, and each shall (separately) speak, and one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>And if there be no one who interpreteth, let him who speaketh with a tongue be silent in the church, and between himself and Aloha let him speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the rest discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>And if to another be revealed while sitting, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For one by one you can all prophesy, that each may learn, and each be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>For the spirit of the prophets to the prophets is subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>Because Aloha is not of tumult, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>LET your women in the church be silent; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also saith the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>But if any wish to learn, in their houses let them ask their husbands; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>But if any man of you think that he is a prophet, or that he is spiritual, let him acknowledge these which I write to you to be the commandments of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man know not, let him not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Be emulous, therefore, my brethren, to prophesy, and to speak with tongues forbid not;</verse>
