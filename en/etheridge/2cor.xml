      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>PAULOS, apostle of Jeshu Meshiha, by the will of Aloha; and Timotheos a brother: to the church of Aloha which is in Kurinthos, and to all the saints who are in all Akaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace be with you and peace, from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be Aloha, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, who consoleth us in all our afflictions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>that we may be able to console those who are in all afflictions by that consolation by which we are consoled of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings of the Meshiha abound in us, so, through the Meshiha, our consolation aboundeth also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and for your salvation that we be afflicted: and if we are consoled, it is that you may be consoled, that there may be in you perseverance to endure those sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And our hope concerning you is steadfast: for we know that if you participate in the sufferings, you also participate in the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>FOR I would have you to know, my brethren, of the affliction that befell us in Asia: for we were greatly pressed beyond our strength, until our life was nigh to be dissolved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>and because of these we had concluded (for) death; that we should not have hope in ourselves, but in Aloha, who raiseth the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who from deaths of violence delivered us, and who will again, we trust, deliver us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>through the help of your prayers for us; that his gift towards us may be a benefit effected for many, and many may praise him on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and purity, and by the grace of Aloha, we are conversant in the world; and not with the wisdom of the flesh, and especially with you yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other (things) to you than those which you know and acknowledge, and which I am confident you will acknowledge unto the end:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>even as you have in part acknowledged that we are your glorying, as you also are ours in the day of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I have willed from the first to come to you, that doubly you may receive benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and that I may pass by you to Makedunia, and again from Makedunia I may come to you, and you may lead me forth unto Jihud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>This then that I have purposed, have I purposed boastingly? or are they things of the flesh that I purpose, that I should have in them Yes, yes, or No, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>Faithful is Aloha that our word with you was not Yes and No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of Aloha, Jeshu Meshiha, who by us hath been preached unto you, by me and by Sylvanas and by Timotheos, was not Yes and No, but it was Yes in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of Aloha in him, in the Meshiha, are Yes; for which by him we give Amen to the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>But Aloha himself confirmeth us with you in the Meshiha, who himself hath anointed us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>and hath sealed us, and given us the earnest-pledge of his Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>BUT I testify to Aloha on my soul that because I am sparing of you, I have not come to Kurinthos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not because we are lords of your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I have determined this in myself, that I will not with sorrow again come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I grieve you, who shall refresh me, but he whom I had grieved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I have written to you this very, lest when I come they grieve me, they who ought to refresh me. But I confide in you, that my joy is that of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>And from great affliction and anxiety of heart I wrote those things to you with many tears, not that you might grieve, but (also) that you might know the abundant love I have towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>But if any one hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me (only), but a part of you all: that the word may not weigh upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>But sufficient for him was this chastisement, which was from many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>And now on the other hand it behoves you to forgive him and console him, lest he who is such an one be swallowed up of excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I entreat of you to confirm to him your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>On this account also I have written, to ascertain by experiment whether in every thing you will obey me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>But to whom you forgive, I also. For I, too, what I have forgiven, have on your account forgiven in the presence of the Meshiha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>lest Satana get the advantage of you; for we know his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>WHEN, in preaching the gospel of the Meshiha, I had come to Troas, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titos my brother. But leaving them, I went forth to Makedunia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But thanks unto Aloha, who in all time maketh us a triumph in the Meshiha, and maketh manifest by us the perfume of his knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are a fragrant perfume in the Meshiha unto Aloha in those who are saved, and in those who perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To these as a perfume of death unto death, and to those as a perfume of life unto life. And unto these who is equal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as the rest who commix the word of Aloha; but as in truth, and as from Aloha, before Aloha in the Meshiha do we speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again anew to show who we are? or do we need as others to write epistles of commendation to you concerning ourselves, or that you should write to commend us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>But you yourselves are our epistle, written in our hearts, and known and read of every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>For you know that you are an epistle of the Meshiha, who hath been ministered by us; written, not with ink but by the Spirit of Aloha the Living; not on tablets of stone, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>BUT such confidence we have through the Meshiha toward Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>For we are not sufficient to think any thing as of ourselves; but our power is from Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who hath made us fit to be ministers of the new covenant, not in the writing, but in the spirit. For the writing killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But if the ministry of death in the writing engraven on stones was with glory, as that the sons of Israel could not look on the face of Musha because of the glory of his face which is abolished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how much more then doth not the ministry Of the Spirit excel in glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much more doth not the ministry of justification excel in glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For that which was glorified had no glory, in comparison of this excelling glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which was abolished was with glory, how much more shall that which endureth be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore because we have this hope, we speak the more boldly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and (are) not as Musha, who threw the veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel might not look upon the End of that which was to be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But they are blinded in their minds unto this day. For when the old covenant is read, that very veil standeth upon them, nor is it apparent (to them) that in the Meshiha it hath been abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>And unto this day, when Musha is read, the veil is thrown upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>And when any one of them is converted unto the Lord, the veil from him is uplifted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>But the Lord himself is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord, (there) is liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all with disclosed faces behold the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, and into the resemblance of it are changed from brightness to brightness, as by the Lord the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>ON this account we have not weariness in this ministry which we have received, according to the mercies that are upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have rejected the secrets of shamefulness; and walk not with craft, nor deal deceitfully (with) the word of Aloha; but by the revelation of the truth make we ourselves manifest to the minds of all men before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if our gospel is hid, to those who perish is it hid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>(to) them whose minds the god of this world hath blinded because they believe not; lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Meshiha, who is the image of Aloha, should arise upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but the Meshiha, Jeshu our Lord; but ourselves that we are your servants for the sake of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For Aloha, who said, Let light arise from darkness, hath arisen in our hearts; that we should be illuminated by the knowledge of the glory of Aloha in the face of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>BUT we have this treasure in a vase of earth, that the greatness of the power might be from Aloha, and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>But in every thing we are afflicted, yet not strangled; we are beaten, yet not condemned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, yet not forsaken; cast down, yet we perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>In all time the dying of Jeshu in our bodies we bear, that the life also of Jeshu might in our bodies be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For if we, the living, unto death are delivered on account of Jeshu, so also will the life of Jeshu be revealed in this our body of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>Now death in us worketh earnestly, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>We then also who have one spirit of faith, as it is written, I have believed, and therefore also spoken; we believe, therefore also we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>And we know that He who raised up our Lord Jeshu, will by Jeshu raise us also, and will present us with you unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For every thing is for your sake, that grace, abounding by many, may multiply praise to the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>For this cause we have not weariness; for if our outward man is wasted, yet the interior man is renovated day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For the affliction of this time, while small and light, a glory without end for ever and ever prepareth for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>While we look not on these which are seen, but at those which are unseen. For the seen are of time, but the unseen are of eternity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>FOR we know that if our earthly house of this body were dissolved, we have nevertheless a building that is by Aloha; a house which is not made with hands, in the heaven, eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For concerning this also we groan, and long to put on our house which is from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if, when that we have clothed, we may not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For now while we are in this house, we groan from the weight of it: yet are we not willing to cast it off, but to be clothed upon of it, that its mortality might be swallowed up in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>And he who prepareth us for this is Aloha, who hath given to us the earnest-pledge of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>For therefore do we know and are persuaded, that so long as we remain in the body we are in pilgrimage from our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>For by faith we walk, and not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>On this account we confide, and long to pass away from the body, and to be with our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>We give diligence, that whether we are pilgrims or inhabitants, we may be pleasing unto Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we are all to stand before the tribunal of the Meshiha, that every man may be recompensed in his body (for) that which is done in it, whether of good or of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>THEREFORE, because we know the terror of our Lord, we persuade men; and to Aloha we are manifest; but I hope that to your minds also we are manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we commend not ourselves again to you, but we give you cause to be boastful of us to them who in appearance boast, but not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we be beside ourselves, (it is) unto Aloha; and if we be right, (it is) unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of the Meshiha constraineth us, because we judge this, That if one for every man hath died, then (was) every man dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And for every man he died, that they who live should not live to themselves, but to him who on their behalf died and arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>And henceforth we no man know according to the flesh; and if we have known the Meshiha according to the flesh, yet from now we know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Whoever therefore is in the Meshiha is a new creature; the old things have passed, and every thing hath become new</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>from Aloha, who hath reconciled us to himself in the Meshiha, and given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>For Aloha is in the Meshiha, who hath reconciled the world with his greatness; and he hath not reckoned unto them their sins, and hath put in us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>WE are ambassadors then for the Meshiha, and as if Aloha himself besought you by us: instead of the Meshiha, therefore, we beseech, Be you reconciled unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For Him who knew not sin, on our account hath he made sin, that we might be in him the righteousness of Aloha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>And as helpers, we beseech of you that the grace of Aloha which you have received be not made ineffectual in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he hath said, In the time acceptable I have heard thee, And in the day of salvation I have helped thee. Behold, Now is the time acceptable; behold, Now is the day of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Nor in any thing give to any man occasion of stumbling, that no blemish may be upon our ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in every thing will we demonstrate ourselves that we are the ministers of Aloha; by much patience, by afflictions, by necessity, by imprisonments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>by stripes, by chains, by tumults, by labour, by watching, by fasting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>by purity, by knowledge, by prolonging the mind, by benignity, by the Spirit of Holiness, by love without deceit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>by the doctrine of truth, by the power of Aloha, by the arms of righteousness for the right hand and for the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>by glory and by shame, by praise and by abuse; as deceivers, and true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and yet we are known; as dead, yet, lo, we live; as chastened, yet we die not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet many making rich; as having nothing, yet possessing every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>OUR mouth is opened to you, Kurinthoyee, and our heart expanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not constrained in us, but you are constrained in your own bowels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>But as unto (my) children, I say to you, Render to me my gains which are with you, and expand your love towards me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>And be not sons of the yoke with them who believe not. For what participation hath righteousness with iniquity? Or what commixture hath the light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>Or what concord hath the Meshiha with Satana? Or what portion hath the believer with the unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>Or what union hath the temple of Aloha with (that) of demons? For you are the temple of Aloha the living; as it is written, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; And I will be their God, And they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Wherefore come out from among them, And be separate from them, (saith the Lord,) And the impure touch not; And I will receive you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And I will be to you a Father, And you shall be to me for sons and daughters, Saith the Lord, who holdeth all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Because then we have these promises, my beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all impurity of the flesh and of the spirit, and accomplish sanctification in the fear of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Bear with us, my brethren; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have injured no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not to your condemnation; for I have said already, that you are laid up in our hearts to die together and to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>GREAT is the freedom I have with you, and great in you is my glorying; I am full of consolation, and my joy greatly aboundeth in me in all my afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>When, also, we had come into Makedunia, no repose had we for our body, but in every thing were we afflicted; without fighting, and within, fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But Aloha, who consoleth the humble, consoled us by the coming of Titos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by his refreshment wherewith he had been refreshed among you. For he told us of your love toward us, and of your lamentation and your zeal on our behalf. And when I heard, my joy was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For though I grieved you in an epistle, I repent me not, though I did repent. For I perceive how that epistle, though for an hour, did make you sorry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>but now I exercise joy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow hath brought you to repentance. For you were sorry towards Aloha; so that in nothing will you suffer loss from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For the sorrow that is for the sake of Aloha worketh soul-penitence, which turneth not and converteth, unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For, behold, (in) this very (case) that you were made contrite for the sake of Aloha; what carefulness it wrought in you, and vindication, and displeasure, and fear, and love, and zeal, and punishment! And by every thing have you shown yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>But, it was for this we wrote to you; not on account of the injurer, nor on account of the injured one, but that you may know before Aloha our carefulness over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this cause we were consoled, and with our consolation more abundantly did we rejoice in the joy of Titos; because his spirit had been refreshed with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because in whatever I had boasted to him concerning you, I have not been ashamed; but, as of every thing we had spoken truth with you, so also our boasting unto Titos hath been found in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection is greatly enlarged toward you, when he remembers your obedience; because with fear and with trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that in every thing I can confide in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>BUT we make known to you, my brethren, the grace of Aloha which hath been given to the churches of Makedunia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in the great trial of their affliction there hath been an abounding of their joy; and the depth of their poverty hath been exceeded by the riches of their simplicity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I testify, that according to their power, and more than their power, in the willingness of their soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>they besought of us, with much supplication, that they might participate in the beneficence of the ministry for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And not as we had supposed, but they gave themselves up first to the Lord, and also to us by the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>For we would request of Titos, that as he had begun, so he would carry into accomplishment this beneficence among you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you have excelled in every thing, in faith, and in doctrine, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in our love toward you, so also in this beneficence may you excel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>Not as though commanding I command you, but, from the diligence of your companions, the truth of your love would I put to the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>FOR you know the beneficence of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that for your sake he became poor, though he was rich, that you through his poverty might be enriched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>But counselling I counsel you this which helpeth you; because from the last year you began not to will only, but also to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now accomplish in work that which you willed, that as there hath been an incitement to will, so accomplish it in work from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be the will, according to what one hath, so is (he) accepted, and not according to what he hath not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>Neither must there be to others ease, and to you anxiety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but in equality be you at this time; that your abundance may be a supply to their want, that also their abundance may be for to your want, that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He who took up much had no superfluity, and he who took up little was not deficient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But praise to Aloha who in-gave this solicitude for you to the heart of Titos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For our request he accepted; and because he had great concern, of his own will he hath come forth among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>But we have sent with him our brother, whose praise in the gospel is in all the churches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>who hath, moreover, been chosen by the churches to go forth with us with this bounty which is ministered by us to the glory of Aloha himself, and unto our cordiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>For we are precautious in this, that no one should lay upon us any imputation</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>with regard to this great bounty which is to be administered by us. For we are careful for the things which are comely, not only before Aloha, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>But we have also sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved in many to be diligent; but now still more diligent from the great confidence he hath concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>Whether, then, (you regard) Titos, he is my companion and helper among you, or the other brethren, they are the apostles of the churches of the glory of Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Wherefore the demonstration of your love, and of our boasting concerning you in these, make manifest in the sight of all the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>BUT concerning the administration of the saints, I do more (than enough) if I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know the goodness of your mind, of which I boasted of you to the Makedunoyee, that Akaia was ready since last year, and your zeal hath stirred up many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I have sent the brethren to you, that our boasting which we boasted of you may not in this affair be vain; but, as I have said, you may be ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest, if the Makedunoyee should come with me, and find you not ready, we be shamed-that I may not say, you be shamed-of the boasting which we have boasted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>For this cause I have been careful to entreat of these brethren to go before to you, to make ready that blessing of which you have caused to be heard before; that it may be prepared, so as that it may be a blessing, not as avarice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this, He who soweth with scantiness, with scantiness also reapeth; and he who soweth with blessing, with blessing also shall reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Every man as he hath in his mind: not as of vexation or as of constraint; for a cheerful giver the Lord loveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>For it is in the power of Aloha to increase in you every good, that you may always have every thing sufficient, and that you may abound in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>As it is written, He hath dispersed and given to the poor, And his righteousness standeth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>But may He who giveth seed to the sower and bread for food, himself give and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>that in every thing you may be enriched in all simplicity, which worketh out through us, thanksgiving to Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For, on account of the performance of this service, we not only supply the deficiency of the saints, but also cause many thanks givings to abound unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>For on account of the proof of this service we glorify Aloha, because you are subject to the confession of the gospel of Meshiha, and you have communicated in simplicity with them and with every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>And prayer they offer on your behalf in great love, on account of the greatness of the grace of Aloha which is upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>But thanks to Aloha over his gift which is unspeakable.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>BUT I Paulos beseech of you by the peacefulness and humility of the Meshiha, (I) who also in presence am humble with you, but while far off am confident over you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>beseech of you, that when I come I may not be constrained with the confidence I have to be bold, as I think, over those men who imagine that we walk in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For if we walk in the flesh, yet we war not according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the armour of our warfare is not of the flesh, but of the power of Aloha; and by it we cast down the strong-holds of rebels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>and demolish reasonings and every lofty thing that is exalted against the knowledge of Aloha, and captivate all thoughts unto the obedience of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>And we are prepared to execute the punishment of those who obey not, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do we regard persons? If any man confide in himself that he is of the Meshiha, let this one know of himself, that as he is of the Meshiha, so also are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For if I should boast somewhat more of the authority which our Lord hath given me, I should not blush; because for your edification he gave it to me, and not for your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>But I insist not, that I may not be considered as one who would terrify you by my epistles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>For there are men who say, His epistles are weighty and forcible; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>But he who after this manner speaks, shall conclude that what we are by the word of our epistle when absent, so are we in the deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not value or compare ourselves with those who glorify themselves; but because they compare themselves with themselves, they do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>For we do not boast beyond our measure, but in the measure of the boundary which Aloha hath apportioned to us, that we might come also unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For it is not as not reaching to you we extend ourselves; for unto you we come with the gospel of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>Neither boast we beyond our measure in the labour of others; but we have hope, that with the increase of your faith, we shall be enlarged according to our measure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>and be progressive also beyond you to evangelize. Not as within the measure of others in the things that are prepared will we glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But let him who glorieth glory in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For it is not he who glorifieth himself who is approved, but he who is glorified of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>BUT I could desire that you could tolerate me a little that I may speak foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>Nevertheless tolerate me, for I am zealous towards you with the zeal of Aloha; for I have betrothed you to one man, a pure virgin, whom I would bring unto the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear lest, as the serpent deceived 'Hava by his guile, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if he who hath come to you shall preach to you another Jeshu, whom we have not preached, or you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted, you would have been well persuaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider that I am nothing inferior to those apostles who are most excellent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>For if I am rude in my speech, I yet am not in my knowledge; but in every thing we are manifest among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or, offending have I offended in humbling myself that you may be exalted, and have gratuitously preached to you the gospel of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>And other churches have I despoiled, receiving of them expenses, for your service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>And being come among you, I burdened no man of you; for my want the brethren who came from Makedunia supplied: and in every thing have I kept myself, and will keep, that I may not be burdensome to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>The truth of the Meshiha is in me, that this boasting shall not be abolished respecting me in the regions of Akaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? because I love you not? Aloha himself knoweth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But I do this, and also will do it, to cut off the occasion of them who seek an occasion, that in the thing in which they boast they may be found as we are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For these are apostles of falsehood and workers of deceits, assimilating themselves to the apostles of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>Nor in this may we wonder, if Satana himself be transformed into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Nor is it a great thing if his ministers also are transformed into ministers of righteousness;-whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>BUT I say again, Let no man think of me as a fool; or if otherwise, let him receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>The thing which I (now) speak, I do not speak in our Lord, but as in foolishness in this place of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Because many boast in the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you are content to listen to the feebleminded, you yourselves being wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you are ruled by one who subjugates you, and by one who devours you, and by one who takes away from you, and by one who exalts himself over you, and by one who smites you on your faces!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>As in abasement I speak; as though we were weak through defectiveness of mind, I speak. In whatever any man dareth, I also dare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>If they are Ebroyee, so am I; if they are Isroloyee, so am I; if they are the seed of Abraham, so am I;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>if they are ministers of the Meshiha,-I speak with defectiveness of mind,-I exceed then! In labours I exceed them, in stripes I exceed them, in chains I exceed them, in deaths many times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>From the Jihudoyee, five times, forty (stripes) wanting one have I devoured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>three times with staves have I been beaten, once was I stoned, three times have I been in shipwreck, a day and a night without a ship have I been in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys many, in danger of rivers, in danger of robbers, in danger from my own race, in danger from the Gentiles; I have been in danger in cities, I have been in danger in the waste, in danger by sea, in danger from false brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in labour and weariness, in much watching, in hunger and thirst, in much fasting, in cold and in nakedness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>besides the aboundings and the gathering which are upon me daily even my care which is for all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must boast in my infirmities, I will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>Aloha, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, the Blessed for ever and ever, knoweth that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Darmsuk the great force of Aretos the king kept the city of the Darmsukoyee to apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>And from a window in a basket they sent me from the wall, and I was delivered from his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>I might boast, but it is not expedient; for I come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I knew a man in the Meshiha fourteen years ago, -whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not, Aloha himself knoweth, -who, this one himself, was rapt unto the third of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know this man himself,-but whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not, Aloha himself knoweth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>-and he was rapt into paradise, and heard words which are not uttered, those which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Of this I boast; but of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>Yet if I willed to boast, I should not be a fool, for I say the truth; but I spare, lest any one think of me beyond that which he seeth me (to be), and what he heareth of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And that I might not be exalted by the abundance of revelations, there was delivered to me a stimulus of my flesh, an angel of Satana to buffet me, that I might not be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this three times I entreated of my Lord that it might be removed from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And he said to me, My grace sufficeth thee; for my power in weakness is perfected. Gladly therefore will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Meshiha may overshadow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>For this cause I am willing in infirmities, in reviling, in affliction, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake of the Meshiha; for when I am weak, then am I strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>Behold, I have been deficient in mind in my boasting, because you have constrained me; for you were debtors to bear witness concerning me; because in nothing am I less than those apostles who are the most eminent, nevertheless I am not any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>The signs of the apostles I have wrought among you in all patience, and with mighty acts and miracles and with powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For in what have you been less than the other churches, except in this, that I have not burdened you? Forgive me this offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Behold, this is three times that I prepare to come to you, and not to burden you; for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>But I gladly the expenses will spend, and also myself will I give for the sake of your souls: though, while the more I love you, you the less love me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>And, perhaps, (though) I did not burden you, yet (it may be said), as a crafty man with deceit I have robbed you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>By any other whom I have sent to you have I made prey of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>Of Titos I requested, and sent with him the brethren. In any thing has Titos made prey of you? Have we not walked in one spirit, and in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>DO you again consider that we apologize to you? Before Aloha in the Meshiha do we speak; and all, my beloved, for the sake of your up-building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I fear lest, when I come to you, I should not find you as I wish, but should find you what you would not wish: lest there be contention and envy, and wrath and angry talk, and accusations and murmurings, and pompousness and agitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>and lest, when I come to you, my God may humiliate me, and I may have to lament over many who have sinned, and have not repented of the uncleanness and of the fornication and of the lasciviousness which they have committed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This is the third time that I prepare to come to you; and in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have foretold you, and again I foretell you; as also twice while I was with you I told you, (so) now also being distant I write to those who have sinned, and to the rest of the others; that if I come again I will not spare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>Inasmuch as you demand the proof of the Meshiha who speaketh in me, (of) Him who is not weak among you, but is mighty among you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>-for though he was crucified in weakness, yet he liveth with the power of Aloha:-so also we are weak with you, but we live with him through the power of Aloha which is among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Prove yourselves, whether in the faith itself you stand; try yourselves. Are you not assured that Jeshu the Meshiha is in you, if you be not reprobates?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I trust you will know that we are not reprobate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>But I implore of Aloha that there may not be any thing in you that is evil, that our proving may be seen; but that you may do good, and that we may be as unproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we are not able to do any thing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice when we are weak, and you are strong: but this also we pray, that you may be perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Therefore while distant I write these (things), that when I am come I may not act severely, according to the power which my Lord hath given me for your edification, and not for your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Wherefore, my brethren, rejoice, and be perfect, and be comforted, and let agreement and peace be among you; and the God of love and of peace shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Salute one another with the holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints ask for your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>THE PEACE OF OUR LORD JESHU MESHIHA, AND THE LOVE OF ALOHA, AND THE COMMUNION OF THE SPIRIT OF HOLINESS, BE WITH YOU ALL. AMEN.</verse>
