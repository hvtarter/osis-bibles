        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>THE RECORD of the generation of Jeshu the Meshicha, the son of David, son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Ishok, Ishok begat Jakub, Jakub begat Jehuda and his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Jehuda begat Pharets and Zoroch from Thomar. Pharets begat Hetsron, Hetsron begat Arom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Arom begat Aminodob, Aminodob begat Nachshun, Nachshun begat Salmun,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmun begat Booz from Rochab, Booz begat Ubid from Ruth, Ubid begat Ishai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Ishai begat David the king; David begat Shelemun from the wife of Uria;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Shelemun begat Rehebaam, Rehebaam begat Abia, Abia begat Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa begat Johushaphat, Johushaphat begat Jurom, Jurom begat Uzia,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Jushia begat Jukania and his brethren at the exile of Bobel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the exile of Bobel Jukania begat Shalathiel, Shalathiel begat Zurbobel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zurbobel begat Abiud, Abiud begat Aliakim, Aliakim begat Ozur,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Ozur begat Zoduk, Zoduk begat Akin, Akin begat Aliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Aliud begat Aliozar, Aliozar begat Mathan, Mathan begat Jakub,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jakub begat Jauseph, husband of Mariam, of whom was born JESHU who is called the Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>Thus all the generations from Abraham to David (were) fourteen generations; and from David to the exile of Bobel, fourteen generations; and from the exile of Bobel to the Meshicha, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>NOW the nativity of Jeshu the Meshicha was thus: While Mariam his mother was betrothed to Jauseph, before they could be consociated, she was found to be with child from the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Jauseph her husband was just, and, not willing to defame her, meditated privately to release her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while (on) these (things) he reflected, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said to him, Jauseph, son of David, fear not to take Mariam thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is from the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She shall give birth to a son, and thou shalt call his name JESHU; for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done, that what was spoken from the Lord by the prophet might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth the son, and they shall call his name Amanuel; which is interpreted, With us (is) our Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Jauseph, when he had arisen from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not until she had given birth to her son, the firstborn; and she called his name Jeshu.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>NOW when Jeshu was born in Beth-lechem of Jehuda, in the days of Herodes the king, there came Magians from the East to Urishlem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>and they said, Where is the king of the Jews who is born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But Herodes the king heard, and was troubled, and all Urishlem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And he assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and anxiously inquired of them where the Meshicha should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>But they said, In Beth-lechem of Jehuda; for so it is written in the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>Also thou, Beth-lechem of Jehuda, wast not the least among the kings of Jehuda; for from thee shall come forth the king who shall be as a shepherd to my people Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herodes privately called the Magians, and learned from them at what time the star appeared to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and he sent them to Beth-lechem, and said to them, Go and inquire diligently concerning the child; and when you have found him, come, show me, and I also will go and will worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>But they, when they had heard the king, went forth; and, lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, proceeded before them, until it came and stood over against where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And they entered the house, and beheld the child with Mariam his mother; and they fell down, and worshipped him. And they opened their treasures, and offered unto him oblations; gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And it was shown to them in a dream, that they should not return unto Herodes; so, by another way, they went unto their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>AND when they were gone, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream unto Jauseph, and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Metsreen, and there be until I tell thee; for it will be that Herodes will seek the child, that he may destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Then Jauseph arose, took up the child and his mother, and fled by night into Metsreen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herodes. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Metsreen have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herodes, when he saw that he had been deluded by the Magians, was greatly wroth, and sent (and) killed all the children of Beth-lechem, and all its limits, from two years and under, according to the time which he had inquired from the Magians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Eramio the prophet, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A cry was heard in Rometha; weeping and great lamentation; Rochel weeping for her children, and not willing to be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>BUT when Herodes, the king, was dead, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Jauseph in Metsreen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Isroel; for they are dead who sought the life of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And Jauseph arose, (and) took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Arkelaos was the king in Jehud, instead of Herodes his father, he was afraid to go thither: and it was shown to him in a dream, that he should go into the region of Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city which is called Natsrath. So would be fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, that a Nazarene he should be called.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>NOW in those days came Juchanon the Baptizer preaching in the desert of Jehud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent! the kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he of whom it was spoken by Eshaia the prophet: The voice which crieth in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>But this Juchanon, his clothing was of the hair of camels, with a loins-belt of leather upon his loins; and his food was locusts and wilderness-honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went forth to him Urishlem, and all Jehud, and the whole country about Jurdan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized of him in Jurdan, the river, while they were confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharishee and Zodukoyee coming to be baptized, he said to them, Generation of vipers, who hath showed you to escape from the wrath that cometh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Work, therefore, fruits which are suitable to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Neither ruminate and say within yourselves, that Abraham is father to us; for I say to you that Aloha is able from these stones to raise up sons unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But, behold, the axe lieth at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which maketh not good fruit is cut down and falleth into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, baptize you with water unto repentance; but He who cometh after me is mightier than I; he, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear,-he baptizeth you with the Spirit of Holiness and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>He (it is) whose fan is in his hand, and, purifying his floors, the wheat he gathereth into his garner, but the chaff he burneth with the fire that is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then came Jeshu from Galila unto Jurdan to Juchanan to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But Juchanon prohibited him, and said, I need from thee to be baptized, and hast thou come unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jeshu answered and said unto him, Permit now; for thus it becometh us to accomplish all righteousness. And then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>But when Jeshu was baptized, he immediately ascended from the waters; and the heaven was opened unto him; and he saw the Spirit of Aloha, who descended, like the dove, and came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And, lo, the voice from heaven, which said, This (is) my Son, the Beloved, in whom I have delighted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>THEN Jeshu was led by the Spirit of Holiness into the desert, that he should be tempted by the Accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And he fasted forty days and forty nights; but afterward he hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And he who tempteth approached and said, If the Son thou art of Aloha, say that these stones shall become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, It is written that not by bread alone liveth the Son of man, but by every word which proceedeth from the mouth of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the Accuser taketh him to the holy city, and caused him to stand on the pinnacle of the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, If the Son thou art of Aloha, throw thyself down; for it is written that his angels he shall command concerning thee, and upon their hands they shall bear thee, that thou strike not against a stone thy foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jeshu said to him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the Accuser took him to a mountain which is exceeding high, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, These all to thee will I give, if thou wilt fall and worship me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then said Jeshu to him, Away with thee, Satana! for it is written that the Lord thy Aloha thou shalt worship, and him only thou shalt serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the Accuser left him, and, behold, the angels drew nigh and ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>BUT when Jeshu heard that Juchanan was perfected, he removed into Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And he left Natsrath, and came and dwelt in Kaphar-Nachum by the sea-side on the borders of Zabolon and of Naptholi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That the thing might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Eshaia, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zabolon, the land of Naptholi, the way of the sea beyond Jurdan, Galila of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness the great light hath seen; and they who have sat in the region and shadow of death, the light has arisen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jeshu to preach, and to say, Repent! for the kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And while he walked by the sea of Galila, he saw two brethren, Shemun who was called Kipha, and Andreas his brother, who were casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And Jeshu said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately forsook their nets and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And when he had passed thence, he saw two other brethren, Jakub-bar-Zabdai and Juchanan his brother, in a vessel with Zabdai their father, repairing their nets: and Jeshu called them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they forthwith left the vessel and their father, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jeshu perambulated all Galila, and taught in their synagogues, and preached the announcement of the kingdom, and healed all disease and affliction in the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame was heard in all Suria; and they brought to him all those who were grievously affected with various diseases, and those who were pressed down by strong pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and the paralysed; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there went after him great gatherings from Galila, and from the ten cities, and from Urishlem, and from Jehud, and from beyond Jurdan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>BUT when Jeshu saw the multitudes, he ascended a mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples drew near to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>BLESSED (are) the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed they who hunger and thirst unto righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed the merciful, for upon them shall be mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed they who are pure in their hearts, for they shall see Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed the makers of peace, for the children of Aloha shall they be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed they who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are you when they treat you with reviling, and persecute you, and say concerning you every evil word, for my sake, in falsity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Then be glad and exult, for your reward is great in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth: but if it happen that salt become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned? It goeth for nothing but to be thrown without and trodden down by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world: It is not possible that a city which is built upon a hill can be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they kindle a lamp and place it beneath a measure, but on a candlestick, and it enlighteneth all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So let your light shine before the sons of men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I came to loose the law or the prophets: not that I might loose, but that I might fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For, Amen I say unto you, that until heaven and earth shall pass away, one yod, or one point, shall not pass from the law, till all be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Every one, therefore, who shall set loose one from these least commandments, and shall so teach the children of men, the least shall he be called in the kingdom of heaven: but every one who shall do and teach, this shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness shall abound more than that of the scribes and the Pharishee, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>YOU have heard that it was said unto them who were before, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill is obnoxious to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say unto you, that he who is angry against his brother rashly, is obnoxious to the judgment; and he who shall say to his brother, Thou empty one! is liable to the council; and every one who shall say, Thou fool! is liable to the gihano of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If it occur, therefore, that thou bring thy oblation to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother retaineth some enmity against thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there thy oblation at the altar, and go, first be reconciled with thy brother, and then come and offer thy oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be at one with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest thy adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exactor, and thou fall into the house of the bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>And, Amen I say unto thee, that thou shalt not come forth from thence till thou hast rendered the last shamuna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that every one who beholdeth a woman so as that he shall desire her, already committeth adultery in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, root it out and cast it from thee: it is better to thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should fall into gihano.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is better to thee that one from thy members should perish, rather than thy whole body should fall into gihano.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It hath been said, that he who looseth his wife should give her a writing of divorcement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say unto you, that whosoever looseth his wife, except on account of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery; and whosoever taketh her who is sent away, committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, you have heard it was said to those beforetime, Thou shalt not lie in thine oaths, but shalt fulfil thine oaths unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say unto you, Swear not at all: not by heaven, for it is the throne of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by earth, for it is the foot-stool beneath his feet; neither by Urishlem, for it is the city of the great king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make a single hair in it either black or white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your discourse be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these is from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say unto you, that you shall not rise up against evil: but if any one strike thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if any one will contend with thee to take away thy tunic, leave him thy mantle also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and if a man compel thee one mile, go with him twain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asketh from thee, and him who would borrow from thee refuse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them who execrate you; do that which is good to him who hateth you; and pray for them who lead you with a chain, and persecute you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>SEE that in your almsgiving you do it not before men, so as that you may be observed by them; otherwise no reward is for you with your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>When, therefore, thou art doing alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as do the assumers of faces in the assemblies and streets, so that they may be praised from men; and, Amen I say to you, they receive their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But thou, when thou art doing thy alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee in openness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when thou prayest, be not as the face-takers, who love to stand in the assemblies and at the corners of the streets to pray, that they may be seen of men; and truly I say to you that they receive their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy secret chamber, and shut thy door, and pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee in openness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when thou art praying, be not wordy, like the profane; for they think that in much speaking they are heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Be you not like them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you before that you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Thus pray: Our Father who art in the heavens! be sanctified thy Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Come thy kingdom. Be done thy will, as in heaven, also in earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>WHEN, too, you fast, be not morosely sad as the assumers of faces, for they defile their countenances so as that they may appear unto men to fast: and, Amen I say unto you, they receive their reward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if the herb of the field, which to-day exists, and tomorrow falleth into the oven, Aloha thus clotheth, how much more you, little of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Be not anxious, therefore, nor say, What shall we eat, or, What shall we drink, or, How shall we be covered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For after all these things do the people of the world inquire: but your Father who is in heaven knoweth that also by you are required these all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of Aloha and his righteousness, and all these shall be added unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not therefore anxious for to-morrow; the morrow shall care for its own: the evil of to-day is enough for it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>WHEN he had descended from the mountain, great multitudes clave to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And, behold, a certain leper came (and) worshipped him, and said, My Lord, if thou art willing, thou canst cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And Jeshu extended his hand, and touched him, and said, I am willing: be clean; and in that very hour his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jeshu said to him, See that thou tell no man, but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation that Musha required for their testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Then when Jeshu had entered into Kapharnachum, a certain centurion approached him, and besought of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>saying, My Lord, my child is lying in the house, paralysed and grievously tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jeshu saith to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and saith, My Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come beneath my roof; only speak in a word, and my child shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority, and under my hand there are soldiers. I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to the other, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jeshu heard this, he was moved with admiration, and said to those with him, Truly I say to you, that in Isroel I have not found faith like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>But I tell you, That many shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Is'hok, and Jakub, in the kingdom of the heavens;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And Jeshu said unto the centurion, Go; as thou hast believed, it shall be to thee. And his child was healed in that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>AND Jeshu came to the house of Shemun, and saw his mother-in-law lying, a fever having seized her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And he touched her with his hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And when it was evening, they brought before him many demoniacs, and he cast out their devils by a word; and all those who were heavily afflicted he healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>So was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Eshaia, who said, That he should take our griefs, and bear our infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Now when Jeshu saw the great multitudes which encompassed him, he commanded that they should go to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a certain scribe approached him, and said, Rabi, I will come after thee to the place whither thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have their dens, and the fowls of heaven a bower, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And Jeshu said to them, Why are you fearful, you little in faith? Then he arose, and forbade the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>But the men were struck with wonder, saying, What (being) is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when Jeshu came to the other side, to the region of the Godroyee, there met him two demoniacs, who came forth from the place of sepulchres, exceedingly malignant, insomuch that no man could pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And they shouted, saying, What to us, and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha? Hast thou come hither before the time, to torment us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>Those demons, therefore, supplicated from him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>Jeshu saith to them, Go: and immediately they went forth, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd rushed directly over the rock, and, plunging into the sea, perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>And they who tended them, fled, and went into the city, and showed every thing that was done, and what concerned these demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>the whole city came forth to meet Jeshu himself; and when they beheld him, they besought from him that he would remove from their coasts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed; and Jeshu saw their faith, and said to the paralytic, Be comforted, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>But men from among the scribes said within themselves, This blasphemeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jeshu knew their reasonings, and said to them, Why reason ye evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Arise, walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that ye may know that authority hath the Son of man in the earth to remit sins, he saith to him-the paralytic,-Arise, lift up thy bed, and go to thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>and he arose (and) went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>When the assembly saw this, they feared, and glorified Aloha who had given such power as this unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>AND when Jeshu had passed thence, he saw a man who was sitting at the place of the tribute-takers, whose name was Mathai; and he said to him, Come after me; and he arose and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And while he reclined in the house, there came to him many tribute-gatherers and sinners, and reclined with Jeshu and with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharishee saw (it), they say to his disciples, Why doth your master eat with tribute-takers and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>But Jeshu, when he heard (it), said to them, The healthful have no need for the physician, but they who are diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go, learn what that is:-" I require mercy, and not sacrifice; " for I am not come to call the righteous, but the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then drew nigh to him the disciples of Juchanon, and said, Why do we and the Pharishee fast much, and thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jeshu said to them, Neither can the sons of the marriage-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them: but the days are coming when the bridegroom shall be taken up from them, and then shall they fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No man inserteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment, lest he should take away its fulness from that garment, and the rent be greater.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And, behold, a woman whose blood had flowed twelve years, came behind him, and touched the edge of his vestment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And when Jeshu went forth, they brought to him a dumb person in whom was a demon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>And another fell into good earth, and gave fruits, this a hundred, another sixty, and another thirty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>and accomplished in them is the prophecy of Eshaia, who said, that hearing they should hear, but not understand, and seeing they should see, but not know.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>That sown the place of thorns, is he who heareth the word, but the anxious thought of this world and the illusions of riches stifle the word in him, and he is without fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>But that which upon good ground was sown is he who heareth my doctrine, and understandeth (it), and giveth fruits, and produceth, whether a hundred, or sixty, or thirty fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>ANOTHER comparison he allegorized unto them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>And while men slept, came his adversary, and sowed zizania among the wheat, and went.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another comparison allegorized he to them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>This is less than all other seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the fowl of the heavens come (and) build in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another parable he spake to them: The kingdom of heaven resembles that leaven which a woman took and hid in three satas of meal, until the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these spake Jeshu in parables to the multitude; and without a parable he did not speak with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>That there should be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, who said, I will open my mouth in comparisons, and pour forth things hidden from before the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jeshu dismissed the multitudes, and came into the house; and his disciples drew near him, and said to him, Expound to us the comparison of the zizania of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>He answered and said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world. Now, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, but the zizania are the sons of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>The adversary who sowed them is Satana; the harvest is the consummation of the world; the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>As, therefore, the zizania are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the completion of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall collect from his kingdom all those who cause offence, and all (who) work iniquity,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>And when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sat down, and selected; and the good they threw into vessels, and the bad they cast without.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.52'>He saith to them, On this account every scribe who is learned in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man a house-lord, who bringeth forth from his treasuries the new and the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>AND when Jeshu had finished these parables, he passed from thence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>and came to his city, and taught them in their synagogues, so that they were astounded and said, Whence hath he (Whence to him) this wisdom and these powers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.55'>Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mariam, and his brothers, Jakub, and Josi, and Shemun, and Jehuda?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For he, Herodes, had seized Juchanon, and bound him, and cast him (into) the house of the chained, because of Herodia the wife of Philip his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jeshu answered, and said to them, Why also do ye transgress the commandment of Aloha for the sake of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For Aloha hath said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and whoso curseth his father or his mother, to die he shall die:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>And he took those seven loaves and the fishes, and offered praise, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you within yourselves, little in faith, because bread you have not brought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember those five loaves for the five thousand, and how many panniers you took up?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>And he said to them, Go also you in the vinery, and what is suitable I will give you. Then went they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>And he went forth again in six and nine hours, and did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>And about eleven hours he went out, and found others who were standing and unemployed; and he said to them, Why are you standing all the day unemployed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go also you into the vinery, and whatever is suitable you shall receive.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>And when they had received, they murmured against the house-lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>and said, These last have wrought one hour, and thou hast made them equal with us, who have borne the burden of the day and its heat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.23'>He saith to them, My cup you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized you shall be baptized: but that you may sit at my right hand, and at my left, is not mine to give, unless to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.30'>And, behold, two blind men were sitting by the side of the way; and when they heard that Jeshu was passing, they gave voice, saying, Be merciful upon us, my Lord, Son of David!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>And he had compassion on them, and touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes were opened, and they went after him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>AND when he drew nigh to Urishlem, and had come to Beth-phage, at the mount of Olives, Jeshu sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>and said to them, Go to this village which is over against you, and you shall at once find an ass tied, and her colt with her; loose and bring (them) to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>and brought the ass and the colt, and laid upon the colt their clothes, and Jeshu rode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>And many of the crowds spread their vestments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>But the throngs who went before him, and came after him, cried out and said, Ushana to the son of David! blessed be He who cometh in the name of the Lord! Ushana in the heights!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>And when he had entered Urishlem, the whole city was commoved, and said, Who is this?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But when the chief priests and Pharishee saw the wondrous things which he did, and the children who were crying in the temple, and saying, Ushana to the son of David, they were displeased with them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>But in the early morn, as he returned to the city, he hungered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and he saw a certain fig-tree in the way, and came to it, but found nothing thereon but leaves only; and he said, Let there be no fruit upon thee again for ever. And immediately that fig-tree withered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>But he answered and said, I am not willing: yet afterwards he relented, and went.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When the lord of the vinery, therefore, cometh, what will he do to these husbandmen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They say to him, Most miserably will he destroy them, and the vinery will he cause to be held by other labourers, (even) such as will give him the fruits in their seasons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then said he to his servants, The feast is prepared, and those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>Go therefore into the outlets of the highways, and every one whom you find call to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>And those servants went forth into the highways, and assembled all whom they found, the bad and the good; and the place of feasting was filled with guests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>And the king entered to see the guests, and he saw there a man who was not dressed in the garments of a festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>And he said to him, My friend, how didst thou enter here, when thou hast not the vestments of the feast? But he was silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then said the king unto the servitors, Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him forth into the darknesses without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are the called, but few the chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>THEN went the Pharishee and took counsel how they might ensnare him in discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent to him their disciples with (certain) of the household of Herodes, saying to him, Doctor, we know that thou art resolutely true, and (that) the way of Aloha in truth thou teachest; neither carriest thou fear for man, for thou acceptest not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us then, how doth it appear to thee? is it lawful to give head-money unto Cesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>But Jeshu knew their malice, and said, Why do you tempt me, you hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me the denarius of the head-silver. And they presented to him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>And Jeshu said to them, Whose are this image and inscription?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They say, Cesar's. He saith to them, Give then (the things) of Cesar unto Cesar, and (the things) of Aloha unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>And when they heard, they wondered, and left him, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>IN that (same) day came the Zadukoyee, affirming to him, (that) there is no life for the dead. And they questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>saying to him, Doctor, Musha has said to us that if a man die having no children, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>But there were with us seven brethren: the eldest (of whom) took a wife, and died. And because he had no children, he left his wife unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>So also did he who was second, and he who was the third, and unto the seventh of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>But the last of all the woman also is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>In the resurrection, therefore, of whom from these seven shall she be the wife? for all had taken her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jeshu answered and said to them, You do err, because you understand not the scriptures nor the power of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection of the dead, they take not wives, neither are wives to husbands; but as the angels of Aloha in heaven are they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which has been spoken to you by Aloha, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Is'hok, the God of Jakub? But Aloha is not of those who are dead, but of those who are alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the multitudes heard, they were wonder-struck at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>BUT when the Pharishee heard that he had silenced the Zadukoyee, they gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>And one from them, who was skilful in the law, questioned him, tempting him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Doctor, which commandment is greatest in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jeshu said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy Aloha with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the commandment, the great and the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like unto it, That thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>while the Pharishee were gathered together, Jeshu questioned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>and said, What say you concerning the Meshicha,-whose son? They say to him, Son of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>Saith he to them, And how doth David in spirit call him THE LORD? For he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>that the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I put thine adversaries beneath thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If, then, David calleth him the Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>And no man could give to him the answer; nor did any man dare again from that day to question him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.23.1'>Then Jeshu discoursed with the multitudes and with his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.32'>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.45'>Then shall he answer and say to them, Amen I say unto you, that inasmuch as you did it not unto one of these little ones, you did it not to me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>AND when Jeshu had finished all these discourses, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>You know not that after two days is the Petzcha, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, in the hall of the chief of the priests, who was called Kaiapha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>And they held counsel concerning Jeshu, how that by artifice they might apprehend and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>And they said, Let it not be on the festival, lest there be a tumult among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>And when Jeshu was at Bethania, in the house of Shemun the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>there drew near to him a woman who carried a vase of aromatic balsam, great of price, and she poured it upon the head of Jeshu as he reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But his disciples saw and were displeased, and said, For what is this destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why grieve you the woman? a good work hath she wrought upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For in all time the poor you have with you, but me you have not in all time with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For this (woman) who hath poured this balsam upon my body, as unto my funeral hath done .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>And Amen I say unto you, Wheresoever this my Gospel shall be proclaimed, in all the world, this also which she hath done shall be told for her memorial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then went one from the twelve, named Jihuda S'carjuta, unto the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said to then, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? But they settled to him thirty of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought to him opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>BUT in the first day of the (Phatiree) unleavened-bread days, the disciples came to Jeshu, and said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>But he said to them, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, Our master saith, My time hath come! with thee will I perform the passover with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jeshu had commanded, and prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, he reclined with his twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And while they were eating, he said, Amen I say unto you, that one from you betrayeth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were very sad, and began to say to him, one by one of them, My Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>But he answered and said, One who dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>And the Son of man goeth as it is written concerning him; but woe to him, to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Better had it been for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Jihuda the traitor answered and said, Am not I (he), Rabi? Jeshu replieth to him, Thou hast said!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>But while they were eating, Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this (is) my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And he took the cup, and offered thanks, and gave to them, and said, Take, drink of this all of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>this (is) my blood of the new covenant, which for multitudes is shed for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will not drink from henceforth of this product of the vines, until the day in which I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And they sang praises, and went forth unto the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>THEN said Jeshu unto them, You all shall be offended in me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and scattered shall be the sheep of his flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after that I am risen I am before you in Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Kipha answered and said to him, Though every man should be offended in thee, I never will be offended in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to thee, that in this night, before the cock shall crow, three times thou wilt deny me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Kipha saith to him, If I am to die with thee, I will not deny thee. The same also all the disciples said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then cometh Jeshu with them unto the place which is called Gedsiman; and he said to his disciples, Sit here while I go and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took Kipha and the two sons of Zabdai; and he began to be sorrowful, and to be vehemently agonized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>And he said to them, My soul is afflicted unto death; wait for me here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And he removed a little, and fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Kipha, How, could you not for one hour watch with me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Be watchful and pray, that you enter not into temptation. The spirit is ready, but the body is infirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again he went the second time, and prayed, and said, My Father, if it be not possible for this cup to pass, unless I drink it, be done thy will!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came again, and found them asleep; for their eyes had become heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And he left them, and went again, and prayed the third time, and said the same word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and be at rest; lo, the hour cometh, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us go: behold, he cometh who betrayeth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was speaking, behold, Jihuda the traitor, one from the twelve, came, and a great multitude with him, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>And Jihuda the traitor had given to them a sign, and said, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he approached Jeshu, and said, Peace, my master! and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But he, Jeshu, said to him, (Is it) for that thou hast come, my companion? Then they came on, and laid their hands upon Jeshu, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one from those who were with Jeshu stretched forth his hand, and unsheathed a sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and took off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then said Jeshu to him, Return thy sword to his place; for every one of them who take swords, by swords shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or thinkest thou that I cannot request from my Father, and he shall appoint to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>(But) how, then, would the scripture be accomplished, that thus it ought to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jeshu said to the multitudes, As against a robber are you come out, with swords, and with clubs, to seize me? Every day with you in the temple I sat and taught, and you did not apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But this was done that what is written in the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all deserted him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And they who apprehended Jeshu led him unto Kaiapha, chief of the priests, where the jurists and elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Shemun Kipha went after him from afar unto the court of the chief of the priests, and entered and sat within with the attendants, that he might see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>But the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole assembly, sought against Jeshu witnesses, that they might put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but they found not (any). And many witnesses of falsehood came. But, last, two came near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>declaring, This said, I can destroy the temple of Aloha, and in three days rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the chief of the priests arose, and said to him, Dost thou return no word? What are these witnessing against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jeshu was silent. And the chief of the priests answered and said to him, I swear thee, by Aloha the Living, that thou declare to us whether thou be the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, That hereafter ye shall see him, the Son of man, sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the chief of the priests tore his robes, and said, Behold, he hath blasphemed! what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now we have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What will you? They answered saying, He deserves death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face, and smote him; and others struck him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, Meshicha! Who is he that smiteth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>But Kipha was sitting without, in the hall, and a certain female domestic approached him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before all, and said, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out into the vestibule, another saw him, and said to them, This also was there with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with oaths, I know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>But, after a little while, they who were standing drew near, and said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art of them; for thy speech also makes thee known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then began he to imprecate and to swear, I know not the man! And in that hour the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Kipha remembered the word of Jeshu, who had said to him, That before the cock shall crow, three times wilt thou have denied me. And he went without, and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>BUT when it was morning, the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jeshu, how they should put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pilatos the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Jihuda the traitor, when he saw that Jeshu was condemned, repented him, and went hastily, and returned those thirty of silver unto the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>and said, I have sinned, for I have betrayed the innocent blood. But they said to him, To us? what to us? Thou knowest,-thou!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And he cast down the silver in the temple, and passed away, and went and strangled himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests took up the silver, and said, It is not lawful that we throw it into the place of offering, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel, and bought with it the field of the potter, for the burial-place of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore that field has been called, The field of blood, until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet, who said, And I took the thirty (pieces) of silver, the price of him who was precious, whom the sons of Isroel bargained for;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>But Jeshu himself stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jihudoyee? Jeshu said to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And while the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he returned not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then said Pilatos unto him, Hearest thou not what they witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he gave him no answer, no, not in one word; and upon this (Pilate) marvelled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at every festival the governor was accustomed to release one of the bound unto the people, whomsoever they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>But there was (then) bound a notorious prisoner who was called Bar-aba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>And when they were assembled, Pilatos said to them, Whom will you that I release unto you, Bar-aba, or Jeshu who is called the Meshicha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For Pilatos knew that from malice they had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>But while the governor sat upon his tribunal, his wife sent to him saying, Let there be nothing between thee and that Just One; for much have I suffered in a dream to-day on his account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that he should release to them Bar-aba, that they might destroy Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>And the governor answered and said to them, Whom will you that I shall release to you of these two? Then they said, Bar-aba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilatos saith to them, And to Jeshu who is called the Meshicha, what shall I do with him? They all said, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>Pilatos saith to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they clamoured the more, and said, Let him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Then Pilatos, when he saw that nothing availed, but that the tumult became greater, took waters (and) washed his hands before the assembly, and said, I am expiated from the blood of this Just One. You shall know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, His blood upon us, and upon our children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>THEN he released to them Bar-aba; and scourged Jeshu with thongs, and delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jeshu to the Praetorium, and the whole cohort gathered against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him, and invested him with a cloak of crimson.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And they interwove a crown of thorns, and set it upon his head, and a cane in his right hand: and they kneeled upon their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jihudoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they did spit in his face, and took the cane, and struck him upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had derided him, they stripped him of the cloak, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him away to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And when they had gone forth, they found a Kurinean man whose name was Shemun: this (man) they compel to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And they came to a place which is called Gogultho, which is expounded, The skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>And they gave him to drink vinegar mingled with gall: and he tasted, but was not willing to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments by lot: that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And they sat down and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they placed over his head the occasion of his death, in the writing, This (is) Jeshu, the King of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>AND they crucified with him two thieves, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>But they who passed by railed against him, moving their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, Destroyer of the temple, and builder of it in three days! deliver thyself, if thou art the Son of Aloha, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders and Pharishee, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Isroel, let him now descend from the cross, that we may see and believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted upon Aloha; let him liberate him now, if he delighteth in him; for he said, I am the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Likewise also the robbers who were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>BUT from the sixth hour there was darkness upon all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jeshu cried with a high voice, Aloha! Aloha! why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>But certain of them who stood there, when they heard, said, This hath cried unto Ilio.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And forthwith ran one from them, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and set it upon a cane, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said, Let alone, we will see whether Ilio (will) come to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>But he, Jeshu, again cried with a high voice, and dismissed his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And at once the veil of the temple was rent in twain from above to beneath; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were riven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>And the house of the buried was opened; and the bodies of many of the saints who had been asleep arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and came forth, and after his resurrection went into the holy city, and were seen by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>But the centurion and those with him, who guarded Jeshu, when they saw the commotion and those (portents) which took place, feared greatly, and said, Assuredly this was the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>(And) many women were there, beholding from afar; those who had come after Jeshu from Galila, and had ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>One of them was Mariam Magdolitha, and Mariam the mother of Jakub and of Josi, and the mother of the sons of Zabdai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>BUT when it was evening, there came a rich man from Rometha, whose name was Jauseph, who himself also was a disciple of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This went unto Pilatos, and begged the body of Jeshu. And Pilatos commanded that the body should be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Jauseph took the body, and wound it round in a cloth of pure linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in a new house of burial of his own, which was hewn out in the rock. And they rolled a great stone, and heaved it against the door of the sepulchre, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now there were there Mariam Magdolitha and the other Mariam, who were sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>BUT the day which was next after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharishee came together unto Pilatos,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying to him, Our lord, we remember that that impostor said while alive, That after three days I will arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that they watch the sepulchre till (after) the third of the days; lest his disciples come, and steal him away by night, and tell the people that from the house of the dead he has risen, and the last delusion be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilatos saith to them, Ye have guards; go, watch diligently, as ye know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went, and set a watch (about) the sepulchre, and sealed the stone along with the guards.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>FROM the evening (end) of the sabbath, when the first (day) in the week was lightening, Mariam Magdolitha and the other Mariam came to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And, behold, there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and drew near, rolled the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His aspect was like lightning, and his raiment was white as the snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And with fear of him they who were watching were shaken, and became as the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel answered and said to the women, Fear not ye; for I know that for Jeshu who was crucified you are seeking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here: for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place in which our Lord was laid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>and go with speed, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the house of the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galila. There shall you see him. Lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they went quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and with great joy, and ran that they might tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And, behold, Jeshu met them, and said to them, Peace to you! And they approached, held him by the feet, and adored him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Jeshu to them, Fear not; but go tell my brethren, that I will go into Galila, and there they shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>But while they went, there came certain from those guards into the city, and told the chief priests every thing that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And they assembled with the elders, and took counsel; and they gave money not a little to the guards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>telling them, Say you that his disciples came (and) stole him away in the night, while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this be heard before the governor, we will persuade him, and make you without care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>But they, when they had received the money, did as they had instructed them; and that saying went forth among the Jihudoyee until to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went into Galila, unto the mountain where Jeshu had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but from them some had doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jeshu drew near, and discoursed with them, and said to them, There is given unto me all power in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>As the Father sent me, so also I send you. Go therefore, disciple all nations, and baptize them in the name (of) the Father, and (of) the Son, and (of) the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>And teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days, until the consummation of the world. Amen.</verse>
