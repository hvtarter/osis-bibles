        <verse osisID='2John.1.1'>THE presbyter to the elect Kuria and to her sons, whom I love in truth, nor I only, but all they who know the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.2'>on account of the truth which abideth in us, and is with us for ever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.3'>Grace be with you and mercy and peace, from Aloha the Father, and from Jeshu Meshiha the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.4'>I have rejoiced much to have found of thy sons who walk in the truth, after the commandment we have received from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.5'>And now I entreat thee, Kuria,-no new commandment writing to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning,-that we love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.6'>And this is love, that we walk according to the commandment; this commandment is according to that which you have heard from the beginning, that in it we should walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.7'>Because many deceivers are come out into the world who confess not that Jeshu Meshiha came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and antichrist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.8'>Be watchful of yourselves, that not any thing perish which you have wrought; but (that with) a complete reward you may be recompensed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.9'>Every one who transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of the Meshiha, hath not Aloha. He who abideth in his doctrine, this hath both the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.10'>If any one come to you, and this doctrine bring not, receive him not into the house, and "Joy to you," and " Farewell," say not to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.11'>For he who saith to him, " Farewell," becometh a participator of his evil deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.12'>Though I have many things to write to you, I will not with parchment and ink; but I hope to come to you, and mouth with mouth to speak, that our joy may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2John.1.13'>The sons of thy elect sister ask your peace. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
