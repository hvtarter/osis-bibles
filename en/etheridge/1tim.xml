      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>PAULOS, an apostle of Jeshu Meshiha, by the commandment of Aloha our Saviour, and of Jeshu Meshiha our hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timotheos, my true son in the faith: grace and mercy and peace from Aloha our Father and Jeshu Meshiha our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>I requested of thee, when I would go into Makedunia, to remain at Ephesos, and instruct certain men that they teach not various doctrines,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor throw themselves (away) upon stories and tales of generations which have no end, (but) which rather subserve contentions, and not edification in the faith of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the end of the commandment is love, from a pure heart, and from a good conscience, and from genuine faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>And from them that have erred, and have declined to vain words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>seeking to become teachers of the law, while they understand not what they speak, nor that concerning which they contend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good, if a man according to the law converse in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing that against the righteous the law is not set, but against the evil, and rebels, and the wicked, and sinners, and the dishonest, and those who are not pure, and those who strike their fathers, and those who strike their mothers, and murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>and fornicators, and liers with men, and stealers of the free, and liars, and doers against an oath</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>and whatever (else) is opposed to the healthful doctrine of the gospel of the glory of the blessed Aloha, with which I have been intrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I thank him who hath empowered me, our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, who accounted me faithful, and constituted me his minister; me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I received mercy, because while ignorant I did it, without faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>But in me hath abounded the grace of our Lord, and faith and love which are in Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful is the word, and worthy of reception that Jeshu the Meshiha came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>But for this he had compassion upon me, that in me first Jeshu Meshiha might show all long-suffering, as an exhibition for them who should believe in him unto everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>But to the King who is eternal, incorruptible, and unseen, who is one Aloha, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This commandment I commit to thee, my son Timotheos, according to the early prophecies which were concerning thee, that thou mayest war through them this good warfare with faith and with a good conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>For those who this have put away from them of faith have been emptied;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>as Hymeneos and Alexandros, whom I have delivered to Satana, that they may not blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I REQUIRE then from thee, that, before every thing supplication be offered to Aloha, and prayer and intercession and thanksgiving for all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>for kings and princes, that an habitation quiet and tranquil we may inhabit in all the fear of Aloha and purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable before Aloha our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who willeth that all men should be saved, and turn to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For one is Aloha, and one is the Mediator of Aloha and of men; the man Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave himself a ransom for every man; a testimony which cometh in its time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>of which I am constituted an herald and an apostle, I say the truth and lie not, to be a teacher of the nations in the faith of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I wish then for men to pray in every place, uplifting their hands purely and without wrath and without disputations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>So also let women with decorous simplicity of apparel,with modesty and with chastity, adorn themselves, not with braidings, and with gold, and with pearls, and with fine vestments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but with good works, as becometh women who profess the fear of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let the wife in quietude learn with all submission:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>for unto the wife to teach I permit not, neither to be authoritative over the husband, but to be in quietude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam was formed first, then Hava;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>and Adam was not deceived, but the wife was deceived, and transgressed the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>But she is saved by her children, if they continue in faith, and in love, and in sanctification, and in chastity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>This saying is faithful, that if a man desire the presbyterate, a good work he desireth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>But it behoveth that a presbyter be as that blame be not found in him; and that he be the husband of one wife; (a man) who is of a vigilant mind, chaste, and orderly, and a lover of guests, and instructful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>and not a transgressor over wine, nor (one) whose hand hastens to strike; but he is to be gentle and not contentious, nor a lover of money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>and (one who) ruleth his house well, holding his children in subjection with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>For if his own house he know not to rule well, how is he able to rule the church of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>Neither shall his discipleship be recent, lest he be lifted up, and fall into the judgment of Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>But it is needful that he have also a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach, and into the net of Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>And also the ministers must be pure, not speaking doubly, not inclined to much wine, nor shall they love unclean gains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>But they shall hold the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>And these are to be proved first, and then to minister, being without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Thus also must the woman be chaste, and they shall be vigilant (in their) minds, and faithful in every thing; and they shall not be accusers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>The ministers shall be (of them) severally who have one wife, and shall rule each his children and his household well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they who minister well, a good degree acquire for themselves, and much openness of face in the faith of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These I write to thee, hoping soon to come to thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I should delay, that thou mayest know how to converse in the house of Aloha, which is the church of Aloha the Living, the column and foundation of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And truly great is this mystery of righteousness, which was revealed in the flesh, and justified by the Spirit, and seen of angels, and preached among the peoples, and believed in the world, and taken up into glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit distinctly saith, that in the last times some will remove from the faith, and will go after deceiving spirits, and after doctrines of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>These, with a false appearance, will deceive, speaking a lie, and seared in their conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>and prohibiting to marry, and abstaining from meats, which Aloha created to be used with thanksgiving by them who believe and know the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>because every creature of Aloha is good, and nothing to be abominated, if with thanksgiving it be received;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified by the word of Aloha, and by prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>These if thou shalt teach thy brethren, a good minister wilt thou be of Jeshu Meshiha, while thou wilt be enlarged with words of faith and of the good doctrine which thou hast learned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But from the foolish stories of old women abstain; and exercise thy soul in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For the exercise of the body a little time profiteth; but righteousness in every thing profiteth, and hath the promise of the life of this time, and of the future.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>FAITHFUL is the saying and worthy is it of reception:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>for on this account we labour and are reproached, because we hope in Aloha the Living, who is the Saviour of all men, and especially of the believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These teach and command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>And let no man despise thy youth; but be an example to the believers in word, and in conduct, and in charity, and in faith, and in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come be diligent in reading, and in prayer, and in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee with prophecy, and the hand-laying of the presbytery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>In these meditate, and in them be, that it may be known to every man that thou goest onward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>And take heed to thyself, and to thy doctrine, and persevere in them; for while these thou doest, thyself wilt thou save, and them who hear thee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>An elder do not reprimand, but persuade him as a father, and those who are young as thy brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>and the elderly women as mothers, and those who are young as thy sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>The widows honour them who are widows in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>And if there be a widow who hath children, or children's children, let them learn first to do justly for their families, and to repay the debts (owing) to their parents; for this is acceptable before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>But she who is truly a widow and solitary (is one) whose hope is in Aloha, and who persevereth in prayer and in supplication by night and by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who serveth pleasure is dead while she liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>These things prescribe to them, that they be without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>For if a man hath not care of them who are his own, and especially of them who are children of the household of faith, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than those who believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Elect, then, the widow who is not less than sixty years, who hath had one husband,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>and who hath the testimony of good works: if she have brought up children, if she have received guests, if she have washed the feet of the saints, if she have cheered the afflicted, if she have walked in every gracious work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But from the widows who are young, withhold (the election); for these become schismatical against the Meshiha, and seek to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>and their condemnation is confirmed, because they have rejected their first fidelity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>They also learn idleness, wandering from house to house; and not only idleness, but also to multiply words, and to follow vain (pursuits), and to speak things which they ought not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I will therefore that those who are young should marry, and bear children, and conduct their households,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>and not give to the adversary any occasion to revile. For already have some begun to turn aside after Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them support them, that they may not be burden-some on the church, that they who are widows indeed may have sufficient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Those presbyters who well conduct themselves shall be worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and in doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox in the treading out; and, Worthy is the labourer of his hire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Against a presbyter an accusation receive not, except on the mouth of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who sin before all men reprove, that the rest may be afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I attest thee before Aloha and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha and his elect angels, that thou keep these, (precepts,) and let not thy mind be pre-occupied by any thing, and do nothing with acceptance of persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>The hand suddenly on any man lay not, neither participate in others' sins. Keep thyself in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>And henceforth water drink not, but wine a little drink, on account of thy stomach, and on account of thy constant infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>THERE are men whose sins are known, and they precede them to the place of judgment; and there are whose (sins) go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>So also good men are known; and those who are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let those who are under the yoke of servitude hold their masters in all honour, that the name of Aloha and his doctrine be not blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>But let not those who have believing masters slight them, because they are their brethren; but serve them the more, because they are believers, and beloved who are refreshed by their ministry. These things teach and require of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>But if there be a man who teacheth other doctrine, and who accedeth not to the healthful words of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and to the doctrine of the fear of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>this (is one) who extolleth himself while knowing nothing, but is infirm with disputation and questioning of words, from which are envy, and contention, and evil speaking, and supposition in the evil mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>and conflicts of men whose minds are corrupt and deprived of the truth, and who consider that gain is the fear of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But thou, remove thyself from them. For our gain is great which is the fear of Aloha, with the use of our sufficiency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For nothing brought we into the world, and we know that nothing we are able to take from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>Therefore sufficient to us are food and raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But they who will be rich fall into temptations and snares, and many lusts which befool and injure, and which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the root of all evil is the love of money; and there are who have coveted it, and from the faith have erred, and have made themselves enter into many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But thou, O man of God, from these things flee, and follow after righteousness, and after equity, and after faith, and after charity, and after patience, and after meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>And contend in the good agony of faith, and lay hold of the life which is eternal, unto which thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I ATTEST thee before Aloha, who vivifieth all, and Jeshu Meshiha, who witnessed before Pontius Pilatos the good testimony,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that thou keep (this) commandment without spot and without blemish, until the manifestation of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>whom in his time will show Aloha the blessed and only Strong One, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>he who only is incorruptible, and (who) dwelleth in light which no man can approach; whom no man of men hath seen, nor is able to see: to him be honour and power for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>The rich of this world instruct, that they be not uplifted in their minds, nor be trustful upon riches which have no security, but upon Aloha the living, who giveth to us all abundantly for our comfort;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>and that they perform good works, and become rich in welldoings, and be ready to give and to communicate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>and lay for themselves a good foundation for that which is to be, that they may lay hold on the true life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, watch over that which is confided to thee, and fly from vain words, and the turnings of false knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>For they who pursue it err from the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</verse>
