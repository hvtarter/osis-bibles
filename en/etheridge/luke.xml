      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>BECAUSE many have willed to record histories of those transactions of which we are persuaded, according to that which they have delivered to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>(they) who from the first were eye-witnesses and ministers of his doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it appeared also to me, that having been intimately near to them all, I should record every thing in its order for thee, illustrious Theophile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that thou mayest know the truth of those doctrines in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>THERE was in the days of Herodes, king of the Jihudoyee, a certain priest whose name was Zakaria, of the service of the house of Abia, and his wife (was) of the daughters of Aharun; her name was Elishaba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both just before Aloha, and walked in all his commandments, and in the righteousness of the Lord, without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no son because Elishaba was barren, and both had become many in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>But it was while he was acting-as-priest in the order of his ministry before Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood he came to set on incense, and entered into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the congregation of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him, to Zakaria, the angel of the Lord, standing on the right hand of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zakaria trembled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>And the angel said to him, Fear not, Zakaria, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elishaba shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And to thee shall be joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice in his birth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong liquor shall he not drink, and with the Spirit of Holiness shall he be filled, from the womb of his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Isroel shall he convert to the Lord their Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elia the prophet, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and those who believe not to the knowledge of the righteous, and to prepare for the Lord a perfect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zakaria said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife many in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, I stand before Aloha, and I have been sent to speak with thee and to announce to thee these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>From henceforth thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak, till the day when these things shall be done, because thou hast not believed these words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>But the people were standing, and expecting Zakaria. and were wondering at his delay in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when Zakaria had come forth, he could not speak to them; and he made them understand that he had seen a vision in the temple, and signing he signed to them, and remained dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when the days of his service were fulfilled, he came to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And it was after those days Elishaba his wife conceived, and she secluded herself five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>And she said, These things hath the Lord done for me in the days of my desolation, to take away my reproach from among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>BUT in the sixth month Gabriel the angel was sent from before Aloha to Galila, to a city whose name (is) Natsrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>unto a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was Jauseph, of the house of David, and the name of the Virgin was Mariam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel entered to her, and said to her, Peace to thee, full of grace! our Lord is with thee, thou blessed among women!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she, when she saw, was troubled at his words, and reasoned what this salutation was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mariam, for thou hast found favour with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>For, behold, thou shalt conceive, and shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He will be great, and the Son of the Most High shall he be called, and Aloha the Lord shall give unto him the throne of David his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jakub for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mariam said to the angel, How shall this be, because a man is not known to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answered and said to her, The Spirit of Holiness shall come, and the Power of the Most High shall shadow over thee; on account of this He who (shall be) born from thee is the Holy, and the Son of Aloha shall be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, Elishaba thy kinswoman, she also beareth a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her,-to her who is called the barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For nothing is difficult to Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mariam said, Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me as thou hast said. And the angel went from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>AND Mariam arose in those days, and went with haste to the mountain to a city of Jehud;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and she entered into the house of Zakaria, and saluted Elishaba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it was that when Elishaba heard the salutation of Mariam, the infant leaped in her womb. And she was filled with the Spirit of Holiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and she cried with a loud voice, and said unto Mariam, Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>Whence unto me is this, That the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, lo, as fell the voice of thy salutation on my ears, For great Joy leaped the infant in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And happy is she who hath believed, For there is a fulfilment of those things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mariam said: My soul doth magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit rejoiceth in Aloha my Saviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Who hath looked upon the lowliness of his handmaid: For, behold, from now all generations shall give blessedness to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>Because he hath done for me great things, he who is mighty, And holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his grace is for ages and generations Upon those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath wrought victory with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath overturned the mighty from their thrones, And hath exalted the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry he hath satisfied with good things, And the rich he hath sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath helped Isroel his servant, And hath remembered his mercy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As he spake with our fathers, With Abraham and with his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mariam stayed with Elishaba three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>BUT to Elishaba had come the time that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and the sons of her family heard that Aloha had magnified his grace upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it was the eighth day, and they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father, Zakaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said to them, Not so; but he shall be called Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, No man in thy kindred is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they signed to his father (to show) how he willed they should call him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he requested a tablet, and wrote, and said, Juchanan is his name. And every man wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And immediately his mouth and his tongue were opened, and he spake, and blessed Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And there was fear upon all around them; and in all the hill country of Jehud were these things spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard reasoned in their hearts, and said, What is this child to be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And Zakaria his father was filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and he prophesied, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord, the Aloha of Israel; For he hath visited his people, and wrought for him redemption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up for us the horn of redemption In the house of David his servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, Who have been from of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>That we should be delivered from our adversaries, And from the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform his grace with our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That to us he would grant That, being delivered from the hand of our adversaries, Without fear we might serve before him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>All our days in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, the Prophet of the Most High Shalt thou be called; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, And thou shalt prepare his way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give the knowledge of salvation to his people In the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the compassions of the grace of our Aloha; Whereby the morn-splendour shall visit us from on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To illumine those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death. And to direct our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and was strong in the spirit, and was in the desert till the day of his manifestation unto Isroel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>NOW it was in those days that there went forth a mandate from Augustus Caesar to enrol the people of his dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This enrolment was first made under the government of Qurinos in Suria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And every man went to be enrolled in his city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Jauseph also went up from Natsrath of Galila, unto Jehud, to the city of David, which is called Beth-lechem, because he was of the house and of the family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>with Mariam his espoused while with child, there to be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it was that while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should give birth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she brought forth her son, the first-born, and wrapped him in bandages, and laid him in the manger; because there was no place for them where they stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>But there were shepherds in the country who were staying there, and keeping watch by night over their flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, behold, the angel of Aloha came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone upon them; and they feared with great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not; for, behold, I announce to you great joy, which shall be to all people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for there is born for you to-day the Redeemer, who is the Lord the Meshicha, in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is to you the sign, You shall find the infant wrapped in bandages, and laid in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And instantly there were seen with the angel many hosts of the heavens, glorifying Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>and saying, Glory to Aloha in the heights, and upon earth peace and good hope for the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels were gone from them into heaven, the shepherds spake one with another, and said, Let us go unto Beth-lechem, and see the thing which the Lord hath made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with speed, and found Mariam, and Jauseph, and the infant who was laid in the manger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>and when they saw, they showed the word which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard wondered at those (things) which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mariam kept all these words, and compared them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And those shepherds returned, glorifying and praising Aloha for all that they had seen and heard as they had been spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>AND when the eight days completed to circumcise the child, his name was called Jeshu, for he was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when were completed, the days of their purification according to the law of Musha, they carried him up to Urishlem, to present him before the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male openeth the matrix the holy to the Lord shall be called:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer the sacrifice as it is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two of the young of pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>But there was a certain man in Urishlem, whose name was Shemun; and this man was just and righteous, and he had waited for the consolation of Isroel, and the Spirit of Holiness was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was said to him from the Spirit of Holiness, that he should not see death, until he had seen the Meshicha of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Behold, this man came in the Spirit to the temple, and when his parents brought in Jeshu the child, to do for him as it is commanded in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him upon his arms and blessed Aloha, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now dismiss thy servant, my Lord, according to thy word, in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For lo, mine eyes have seen thy grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which thou hast prepared in the face of all the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light for the revelation of the peoples, And the glory of thy people Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>But Jauseph and his mother wondered at these words which were spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Shemun blessed them, and said to Mariam his mother, Behold, this child is set for the ruin and uprising of many in Isroel, for the sign of contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>And through thine own soul shall pass a spear, that may be revealed the reasonings of the hearts of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>NOW Chana, the prophetess, (was) the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was aged also in her days, and seven years with her husband had lived from her virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow as of years eighty and four, and she removed not from the temple, and with fasting and with prayer she worshipped in the day and in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she also arose in that hour and confessed the Lord, and discoursed concerning him with all who were expecting the redemption of Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had fulfilled every thing according to the law of the Lord, they returned unto Galila, to Natsrath their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>But the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and was filled with wisdom; and the grace of Aloha was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his relatives every year went unto Urishlem at the feast of Petscha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>AND when he was a son of twelve years, they went up, as they were used, to the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when the days (were) fulfilled, they returned. But Jeshu, the child, remained in Urishlem, and Jauseph and his mother knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>For they thought that he was with the sons of the company; and when they had gone the journey of one day, they sought him with the men and with any who knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And they found him not: and they returned again to Urishlem, and sought him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all of them were astonished, as they heard him, at his wisdom and at his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they wondered; and his mother said to him, My son, why hast thou done with us thus? for, behold, I and thy father with great anxiety have sought thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He saith to them, Why have you sought me (elsewhere)? Knew you not that (in) the house of my Father it behoveth me to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not comprehend the word that he spake to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Natsrath, and was subject to them. But his mother kept all these words in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>But Jeshu increased in his stature, and in his wisdom, and in favour with Aloha and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>NOW in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberios Cesar, in the government of Pontios Pilatos in Jehud, Herodes being chief of the Fourth in Galila, and Philipos his brother chief of the Fourth in Ituria and in the region of Trakona, and Lusania chief of the Fourth of Abilini;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Chanan and of Kaiopha, was the word of Aloha unto Juchanon bar Zakaria in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into the whole country about the Jurdan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Eshaia the prophet, who said, The voice which crieth in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord, And make straight in the plain the highways for our Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>All valleys shall be filled, And all mountains and heights be brought low, And the mound shall be a level (place), And the rough place a plain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>And he said to those multitudes who came to him to be baptized, O brood of vipers, who hath showed you to flee from the wrath that cometh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Work therefore fruits which are worthy of repentance. And begin not to say within yourselves that Abraham is father to us; for I tell you, that from these stones Aloha is able to raise up sons unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>But, behold, the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore which good fruit maketh not, is cut down and into the fire falleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the assemblies inquired of him, saying, What then shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said to them, Whoever hath two tunics, let him give to him who hath none; and whoever hath food, so let him do (likewise).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>The publicans also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Malphona, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>But he said to them, Demand not any thing more upon what is prescribed to you to require.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And the military servants asked of him and said, What shall we also do? And he said to them, Molest no man, oppress no man, and let your wages satisfy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>But while the people thought concerning Juchanon, and all of them reasoned in their hearts whether he were the Meshicha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>Juchanon answered and said to them, Behold, I baptize you with waters, but there cometh after me He who is mightier than I; He, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Spirit of Holiness and with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>He who, holding the fan in his hand, and cleansing his floors, gathereth the wheat into his garners, and the chaff he will burn in the fire which is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>But many other things he also taught and preached to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herodes Tetrarka, because he was reproved by Juchanon concerning Herodia the wife of Philipos his brother, and concerning all the evil things which he had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this also upon all, and shut up Juchanon in the house of the chained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>But it was when he had baptized all the people, and also Jeshu he baptized. And while he prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>the heavens were opened, and the Spirit of Holiness descended upon him in the bodily likeness of a dove: and the voice was from the heavens, which said, Thou art my Son the Beloved One, in thee I have delighted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>BUT Jeshu, being full of the Spirit of Holiness, returned from the Jurdan, and the Spirit led him into the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>to be tempted forty days by the accuser. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were fulfilled, afterwards he hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>And the accuser said to him, If thou art the Son of Aloha, tell this stone to become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>Jeshu answered and said to him, It is written, It is not by bread alone that the son of man liveth, but by every word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>And Satana carried him up into a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth in a little time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the accuser said to him, To thee will I give all this power and the glory of it, which to me is delivered; and to whomsoever that I will, I give it unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>If therefore thou wilt worship before me, thine shall be all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>But Jeshu answered and said to him, It is written, That the Lord thy Aloha thou shalt worship, and him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>And he caused him to be at Urishlem, and to stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of Aloha, throw thyself from hence beneath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>for it is written, His angels he shall charge concerning thee to keep thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.11'>and upon their arms to bear thee up, that thou strike not thy foot against a stone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>And when the accuser had accomplished all his temptations, he removed from him for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>AND Jeshu returned in the power of the Spirit into Galila, and there went forth a report concerning him in all the region about them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>and he taught in their assemblies, and was glorified of every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And he came to Natsrath where he had grown up; and he went out, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the day of shabath, and he stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And there was given to him the book of Eshaia the prophet, and Jeshu opened the book and found the place where it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he hath anointed me to evangelize to the poor, And hath sent me to heal the contrite in heart, To proclaim to the captives release, And to the blind, vision, And to assure the contrite by remission,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>And to proclaim the year of acceptance of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And he rolled the book, and gave it to the minister, and went and sat down; but the eyes of all them in the synagogue beheld him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And he began to say to them, Today is fulfilled this scripture which is in your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all witnessed him and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded from his mouth. And they said, Is not this the son of Jauseph?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>Jeshu said to them, You will perhaps say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself; and all that we have heard that you have done in Kapher-nachum do also here in your own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>But he said, I tell you assuredly, There is no prophet who is received in his (own) city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>For I say to you the truth, that many widows were in the house of Isroel in the days of Elia the prophet, when the heavens were shut up for three years and six months, and great famine was in all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>and to none of them was Elia sent, but to Sarephath of Tsaidon, unto a woman a widow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>and many lepers were in the house of Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet, and not one of them was cleansed only Namon the Aramian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>And when they heard these things, they who were in the synagogue were all of them filled with anger,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and they arose, forced him without from the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built to throw him from the rock:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>but he passed through them and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>AND he went down to Kapher-nachum, a city of Galila, and instructed them on the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for with power was his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And there was in the synagogue a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil, and he cried with a high voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>and said, Leave me, what to us and to thee, Jeshu Natsroia? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jeshu rebuked him, and said, Close thy mouth, and come forth from him. And the devil cast him down in the midst, and came forth from him, and hurt him not any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And wonder seized on every man, and they spake with each other and said, What thing is this? for with authority and with power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they go forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And there went out the fame concerning him into all the region which surrounded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And when Jeshu had gone forth from the synagogue, he entered into the house of Shemun; and the mother-in-law of Shemun was afflicted with a great fever, and they besought him on behalf of her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>and he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she rose up at once and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>But at the setting of the sun all they who had diseased ones, who were diseased with various diseases, brought them to him, and he upon every one of them laid his hand, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And he cast forth also devils from many, (they) crying out, and saying, Thou art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha. And he rebuked them, and suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was the Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And at the dawn of day he departed, and went to a desert place; and the people sought him, and came to him, and held him, that he should not go from them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but Jeshu said to them, To other cities also must I go to announce the kingdom of Aloha, for concerning this I have been sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>And he preached in the synagogues of Galila.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>AND it was while the assembly gathered upon him to hear the word of Aloha, he stood upon the bank of the sea of Genesar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two vessels standing by the sea-side, and the fishermen who had gone up from them, and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And one of them was of Shemun Kipha; and Jeshu ascended, sat in it, and directed that they should take it a little from the land into the waters; and he sat, and taught the multitudes from the vessel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he was silent from his discourses, he said to Shemun, Lead into the deep, and cast forth your nets for a draught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Shemun answered and said to him, Rabi, the whole night we have laboured and nothing have we taken; but at thy word I throw the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had this done, they enclosed great multitudes of fishes, and their net brake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they signed to their companions, who were in another vessel, to come and help them. And when they had come, they filled those two vessels, so that they were nigh to be swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>But when Shemun Kipha saw, he fell before the feet of Jeshu and said to him, I pray from thee, my Lord, remove thee from me, for I am a man a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For amazement had seized him, and all who were with him, on account of the draught of fishes which they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>Even so also Jacub and Juchanon, sons of Zabdai, who were partners of Shemun. But Jeshu said, Fear not, from henceforth the sons of men shalt thou catch unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And they brought the vessels to land, and forsook every thing, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>AND when Jeshu was in one of the cities, there came a certain man who was wholly filled with leprosy; he saw Jeshu, and fell upon his face, and prayed of him, and said to him, My Lord, if thou art willing, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And Jeshu extended his hand, touched him, and said to him, I am willing; be clean. And in an instant his leprosy went from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he commanded him, Tell no man, but go show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy cleansing, as Musha ordained for their testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>And the fame concerning him went forth the more, and much people were gathered together to hear him and to be healed from their diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And he passed away into the desert, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it was on one of the days, while Jeshu was teaching, (certain) Pharishee and doctors of the law were sitting. And they had come from all the villages of Galila and of Jehud, and from Urishlem: and the power of the Lord was (there) to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And some brought on a couch a certain man a paralytic; and they sought to enter, that they might set him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they found not how to bring him in because of the multitude of people, they ascended to the house-top, and sent him with his couch from the roof into the midst before Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Man, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the Sophree and Pharishee began to reason and to say, Who is this who speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but Aloha only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jeshu knew their reasoning, and said to them, What reason you in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Forgiven to thee are thy sins; or to say, Arise, walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that authority hath the Son of man in the earth to forgive sins,-he saith to the paralytic,-To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he arose before them, and took up his couch, and went to his house, glorifying Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement held every man; and they glorified Aloha, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen today wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After these things Jeshu went forth, and saw a tribute-taker, whose name was Levi, sitting at the house of tribute. And he said to him, Come after me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>and he left every thing, and arose, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made in his house a great feast; and there was a large company of tribute-takers, and of others that reclined with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Sophree and Pharishee murmured, saying to his disciples, Why with tribute-takers and sinners eat you and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jeshu answered and said to them, The whole do not require the physician, but they who are grievously ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am not come to call the just, but the sinners, to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>But they say to him, Why do the disciples of Juchanon constantly fast, and pray also as the Pharishee, but thine eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>But he said to them, How can you make the sons of the chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He spake to them a parable: No man cutteth a piece from a new material, and fasteneth it upon an old garment; lest he rend the new, without completing the old with the piece that is new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man poureth new wine into old bottles; lest the new wine burst forth, and the wine be shed, and the bottles perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But they pour new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no man, drinking old wine, immediately asketh new: for he saith, The old is softer.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>IT was on the shabath, while Jeshu was walking among the corn, and his disciples gathered the ears, and rubbed in their hands and ate (them).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharishee said to them, Why do you a thing which it is not lawful on the shabuth to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jeshu answered and said to them, And this have you not read, what David did when he hungered, and they who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>that he went into the house of Aloha, and the bread of the table of the Lord he took, ate, and gave to them who were with him, that (bread) which was not lawful to eat, except by the priests only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And he said to them, That the Lord of the shabath is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>And it was on another shabath (that) he entered into the synagogue, and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was dried:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man whose hand was dried, Rise (and) come into the midst of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>And when he had come and stood, Jeshu said to them, I ask you which is lawful to do on the shabath, good or evil, life to save or to destroy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And he beheld them all, and said to him, Stretch forth thine hand: and he stretched it forth, and his hand was restored as its fellow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with envy, and spake one with another what they should do with Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>BUT it was in those days that Jeshu went forth into a mountain to pray; and there remained he all night in the prayer of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>And when the day brake, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, those whom he named Apostles,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>And Jeshu descended with them, and stood in the plain, and a great assembly of his disciples and a multitude of people from all Jehud, and from Urishlem, and from the sea-coast of Tsur and Tsaidon,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>AND when he had finished all these words in the hearing of the people, Jeshu entered into Kapher-nachum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>But the servant of a certain centurion, who was valued by him, was sick, and nigh unto dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And he heard of Jeshu, and sent to him the elders of the Jihudoyee, and besought him to come (and) save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And they, when they came to Jeshu, besought of him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou do this for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loveth our people, and also a synagogue he hath built for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>And Jeshu went with them. But when he was not greatly distant from the house, the centurion sent to him his friends, saying to him, My Lord, labour not, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter beneath my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Wherefore I was not worthy to come to thee; but speak by a word, and my youth shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man who am subjected under authority; and there are under my hand soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>Now when Jeshu heard these (words), he admired, and turned and said to the company who came after him, I tell you, that not also in the house of Isroel have I found faith like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they who had been sent, returned to the house, and found the servant who had been sick now well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>AND it was the day after, that he went to a city whose name was Nain, and his disciples with him, and a great multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And as he approached the gate of the city, he saw (them) following (one) dead, who was the only born of his mother, and she his mother was a widow: and a great multitude of the people of the city were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And Jeshu beheld her, and had compassion upon her, and said to her, Weep not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he went and touched the bier; and they who were carrying it stood. And he said, Young man, to thee I say, Arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized all men; and they glorified Aloha, saying, A great prophet hath arisen among us, and Aloha hath visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this word concerning him went forth into all Jihud, and into the whole region around them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And the disciples of Juchanon showed him all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>AND Juchanon called two from his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>and sent them to Jeshu, saying, Art thou He who cometh! or another should we expect?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>But in that very hour he healed many from diseases, and from plagues, and from evil spirits; and to many blind he gave to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And Jeshu answered and said to them, Go tell Juchanon every thing you have seen and heard: that the blind see, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead arise, and the poor are evangelized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>But when the disciples of Juchanon were gone, Jeshu began to speak to the people concerning Juchanon: What went you forth into the wilderness to see? a reed from the wind shaken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>If not, what went you forth to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are clothed in bright vestments, and are (living) in pleasures, are in the house of kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>If not, what went you forth to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>he, concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send mine angel before thy face, Who shall prepare the way before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you, that no prophet among those born of women (hath been) greater than Juchanon the Baptizer. Yet the least in the kingdom of Aloha is greater than he.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharishee and Sophree rejected against themselves the will of Aloha, because they were not baptized of him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>With what therefore shall I compare the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the public place, and crying to their companions, and saying, We have sung to you, and you have not danced; we have wailed to you, and you have not wept.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a man a devourer and a drinker of wine, and a friend of tribute-takers and of sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But justified is wisdom of her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>NOW there came one of the Pharishee requesting of him to eat with him: and he entered into the house of the Pharisha, and reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And a woman, a sinner, was in that city; and when she knew that in the house of the Pharisha he reclined, she took a vase of ointment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and stood behind him at his feet and wept, and began with her tears to bedrop his feet, and with the hair of her head to wipe them, and she kissed his feet, and anointed (them) with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>But when the Pharisha who had invited him saw (this), he thought within himself and said, Were this a prophet, he would know who this is and what is her report, for this woman is a sinner who toucheth him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>But Jeshu answered and said to him, Shemun, I have somewhat to say to thee. He said to him, Say, Rabi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>Jeshu said to him, A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed him five hundred dinoree, and the other fifty dinoree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And when they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which, therefore, of them the most would love him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Shemun answered and said, I think he to whom much was forgiven. Jeshu said to him, Thou hast judged rightly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And he turned to that woman, and said to Shemun, Thou seest this woman: I entered thy house; waters for my feet thou gavest me not; but this with her tears hath bedropped my feet, and with her hair hath wiped them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>Thou didst not kiss me; but, behold, this from (the time) I entered hath not ceased my feet to kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>Thou with ointment my feet didst not anoint, but this with ointment of balsam my feet hath anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Therefore I tell thee, That forgiven to her are her many sins, because she hath loved much. For he to whom little is forgiven, little loveth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>But they who reclined said among themselves, Who is this who also sins forgiveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But Jeshu said to that woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>AND it was after these things that Jeshu itinerated among the cities and villages, and preached and announced the kingdom of Aloha, and his twelve with him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a great multitude had assembled, and from all the cities had come to him, he discoursed in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went forth to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the road-side; and it was trodden down, and the fowl devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other fell upon the rock; and it immediately sprang up, and, because it had no moisture, it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other fell among thorns, and they sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell into ground good and fair, and sprang up, and made fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these (words), he cried, Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, What is (the signification of) this parable?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>But he said to them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Aloha; but to those who are the rest in similitudes is it spoken; that while seeing they may not see, and while hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>But this is the parable: The seed is the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Now they by the road-side are they who hear the word; and the adversary cometh, and taketh up the word from their hearts, that they should not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>But those who fell upon the rock are those who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; yet root they have not, but for a time is their faith, and in the time of temptation they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>But that which fell among thorns are they who hear the word, and by the cares, and by the riches, and by the lusts of the world, they are choked, and fruit they give not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that which (was) in good ground are they who, with hearts humble and good, hear the word and retain, and give fruits with perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>NO man lighteth a lamp, and covereth it with a measure, or setteth it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that every one who cometh in may see the light of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Now came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not speak with him on account of the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And they said to him, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, desiring to see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered and said to them, These are my mother and my brethren, they who hear the word of Aloha, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>NOW it was on one of the days that Jeshu ascended and sat in a vessel and his disciples: and he said to them, Let us pass to the other side of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they went, Jeshu himself slept. And there became a storm of wind on the water, and nigh was the vessel to be swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they approached (and) awoke him, saying to him, Our master, our master, we perish! But he arose and rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea; and they quieted, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they, afraid, wondered, saying one with another, Who is this that also commandeth the winds, and to whom the waves and the sea are obedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they went forward and came to the country of the Godroyee, which is over against Galila.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>But when he saw Jeshu, he cried out, and fell before him, and said in a high voice, What to us and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha Marima? I beseech of thee, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For Jeshu commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man. For long was the time that he had been enthralled of him; and (when) bound with chains, and kept with fetters, he had burst asunder his bonds, and had been driven by the demon into the waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jeshu demanded of him, What is thy name? He saith to him, Legion: because that many devils had entered into him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was there a great herd of many swine which fed on the hill: and they besought from him that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And the demons went forth from the man, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd went directly to the precipice, and plunged into the waters, and were suffocated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when the herdmen saw the thing that was done, they fled, and made known in the city and in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And the men went forth to see the thing which was done. And they came to Jeshu, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, clothed, sober, and sitting at the feet of Jeshu. And they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And they who had seen it showed to them how the man of the demon had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole multitude of the Godroyee besought of Jeshu that he would go from them, because great fear had taken them. And he, Jeshu, ascended the ship, and returned from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But he, the man from whom had gone forth the demons, besought of him that he might be with him. But Jeshu dismissed him, and said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thine house, and show what Aloha hath done for thee. And he went and proclaimed in every city what Jeshu had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>WHEN Jeshu returned, a great multitude received him: for they were all expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And a certain man whose name was Jorush, head of the synagogue, fell before the feet of Jeshu, and besought him to enter into his house;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jeshu said, Who touched me? And when all denied, Shemun Kipha and those with him said, Raban, the crowd straiteneth and presseth thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And she, the woman, when she saw that she was not hid, came trembling and fell (and) worshipped him. And she told before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how at once she had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>But he, Jeshu, said to her, Be comforted, my daughter: thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>And while he was speaking, there came a man from the chief of the synagogue and said to him, Thy daughter is dead, weary not the Malphona.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jeshu knew the thought of their heart; and he took a child and made him stand with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>And he said to them, Every one who receiveth a child like this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever receiveth me, he receiveth Him who sent me. For he who is least among you, he shall be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And Juchanon answered and said, Raban, we saw a man who was casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he came not with us after thee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when Jacub and Juchanon his disciples saw it, they say to him, Maran, art thou willing that we call fire to descend from heaven to consume them, as Elia did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and reproved them, and said, You know not of what spirit you are: for the Son of man is not come to destroy lives, but to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And while they went in the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow thee to the place whither thou goest, my Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have holes and the fowls of the heaven a shadow, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Jeshu saith to them, Nor tell I you by what authority I do these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vinery, and let it to husbandmen, and removed for a great time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent his servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vinery. But the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he added and sent another servant; but they beat him also, and maltreated him, and sent him away empty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>The lord of the vinery saith, What shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved; now will they see him and reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they cast him out of the vinery, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vinery do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vinery to others. But when they heard, they said, May this not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he beheld them, and said, And what is that which is written, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>And every one who shall fall upon this stone shall be broken; and every one on whom it shall fall it will scatter him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>But the chief priests and Sophree sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; but they feared the people, for they knew that concerning them(selves) he had spoken this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they sent to him spies, who should resemble just men, that they might take him in discourse, and deliver him to the judgment and to the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, and said to him, Doctor, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou deceive, but with integrity thou teachest the way of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give head-silver to Cesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he understood their subtilty, and said, Why tempt you me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jeshu saith to them, The sons of this world take wives, and women become (the wives) of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but they who of that world are worthy, and of the resurrection which is from among the dead, take not wives, neither do women become (the wives) of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Neither again can they die, for they are as the angels; and the children are they of Aloha, because they have become the children of the resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>But he was not the God of the dead, but of the living: for they all live unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the Sophree answered and said to him, Doctor, thou hast well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And they dared not question him again of any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>AND he said to them, How say the Sophree concerning the Meshicha, that he is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood and strenuously accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herodes and his soldiers treated him as a fool; and when he had derided him, he dressed him in a robe of crimson, and sent him to Pilatos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And in that day Pilatos and Herodes were friends with each other; for before there had been enmity between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilatos called the chief priests and the rulers of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, You have brought to me this man as a perverter of your people; and, behold, I have examined him in your sight, and have found no cause in this man of all that you accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>nor also Herodes; for I sent him unto him, and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and dismiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>For a custom had he to release to them one at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But all the multitude cried out, saying, Take this, and release to us Baraba;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>he who, for insurrection and murder which had been done in the city, had been thrown into the house of the chained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>But Pilatos spake with them again, being willing to release Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried out, saying, Crucify him! Crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>He the third time also said to them, Why, what evil hath this done? Cause whatever that is worthy of death, I find not in him: I will therefore chastise him, and dismiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent with a high voice, demanding that they might crucify him; and theirs and the voices of the high priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilatos commanded that their requirement should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released to them him who, for insurrection and murder, had been thrown into the house of the chained, whom they had asked: but Jeshu he delivered to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>AND as they led him away, they laid hold on Shemun Kurinoya, who was coming from the country, and they laid on him the cross, that he might bear (it) after Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him much people, and those women who mourned and wailed for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>And Jeshu turned to them, and said, Daughters of Urishlem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, coming are the days in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts that have not suckled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the heights, Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if to the tree which is good they do these things, unto the dry what shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there went with him two others, workers of evil, to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to a certain place called Karkaphtha, there they crucified him, and those workers of evil, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>BUT Jeshu himself said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, and cast for them lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>But the people stood beholding, and the rulers also, mocking him, and saying, He saved others, let him save himself, if he be the Meshicha, the Chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also, deriding him, approaching him, and offering to him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>said to him, If thou art the King of the Jihudoyee, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription which was written over him in Greek and Roman and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JIHUDOYEE.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of those workers of evil who were hanged with him, blasphemed against him, saying, If thou art the Meshicha, deliver thyself, and deliver us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>And his companion rebuked him, and said to him, Dost thou not fear (even) Aloha? for thou also art in this judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we righteously, forasmuch as we have been deserving, and as we are punished for that which we have done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>but this hath done nothing that is abominable. And he said to Jeshu, Remember me, my Lord, when thou art come into thy kingdom!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to thee, That to-day with me thou shalt be in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>NOW it was about six hours, and there was darkness over all the earth until nine hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun darkened, and rent was the vail of the temple through the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jeshu cried with a high voice, and said, My Father, in thy hands I place my spirit. This he said, and completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>But when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified Aloha, saying, Assuredly this was a just man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the multitude, they who were assembled to see this, when they saw what was done, returned, smiting upon their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And there were standing afar off all the acquaintances of Jeshu, and those women who came with him from Galila; and they saw these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>BUT a certain man, whose name was Jauseph, a senator from Rometha, a city of Jehud, a man (who) was good and just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this had not consented to the counsel and deed of them; and he was waiting for the kingdom of Aloha:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>this approached Pilatos, and begged the body of Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>and he took it down, and wrapped it in a cloth of linen, and laid it in a hewn sepulchre, in which no one had hitherto been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of the preparation; and the shabath had lighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women also drew near, they who had come with him from Galila; and they saw the sepulchre, and where the body was laid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>and, returned, they prepared balsams and aromatics, and on the shabath rested, as it is commanded.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first (day) in the week, in the morning, while yet dark, they came to the sepulchre, and brought those aromatics which they had prepared;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>and with them there were other women. And they found the stone rolled from the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and entered, but found not the body of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it was that while they were amazed at this, behold, two men stood over against them, and whose raiment shined;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and they were in fear, and bowed their faces to the earth. And they said to them, Why are you seeking the living with the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, he is risen. Remember what he spake with you while he was in Galila,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>and (when he) said, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of men of sins, and he will be crucified, and (in) the third of the days he will arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these (things) unto the eleven, and to the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now it was Mariam Magdalitha, Juchanon, and Mariam his mother, and Jacub, and the rest who were with them, who told these (occurrences) to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words appeared in their eyes as dreams, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Shemun arose, and ran to the sepulchre, and, looking in, he saw the linen clothes lying apart; and he went away, wondering in himself at what was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>AND, behold, two of them in that day went to a village whose name was Emaos, and distant from Urishlem sixty stadia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked one with the other of all these (events) which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And while they discoursed and investigated one with the other, Jeshu himself came and went with them, and walked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>And their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What are these words that you speak with each other, as you walk and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them answered, whose name was Kleopha, and said to him, Art thou only a stranger from Urishlem, who knowest not what hath been done in it in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>He saith to them, What? They say to him, Concerning Jeshu, who was of Natsrath, a man who was a prophet, and mighty in word and in deed before Aloha, and before all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>And the chief priests and elders delivered him to the judgment of death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we had hoped that it was he who shall redeem Isroel; and, lo, three days (have passed) since all these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>But women also of us have astonished us; for they were before at the sepulchre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they found not his body, they came and told us that angels they had seen there, and (that) they had said concerning him that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some also of us went to the sepulchre, and found even as the women had said, but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then said Jeshu to them, O wanting in understanding, and hard of heart to believe all the things which the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not to be that these the Meshicha should suffer, and enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And, beginning from Musha and all the prophets, he explained to them concerning himself from all the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to that village to which they were going; and he made them suppose that to a more distant place he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they constrained him, and said to him, Abide with us, because the day now inclines to darken. And he went in to remain with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it was that, while he reclined with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And at once their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he was taken from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to the other, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he spake with us by the way, and explained to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they arose in the same hour, and returned to Urishlem, and found the eleven, who were assembled, and they who were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, Assuredly our Lord is risen, and hath appeared unto Shemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they also declared those things which had happened in the way, and how he was made known to them while he brake the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>AND while they were discoursing, Jeshu stood among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>I am; fear not. And they were troubled, and were in fear; for they thought they beheld a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>Jeshu saith to them, Why are you perturbed, and why arise thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I: feel me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And while these words he spake, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they as yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here somewhat to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave to him a portion of broiled fish, and of the comb of honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took (and) did eat before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke with you while I was with you, that every thing must be fulfilled which is written in the law of Musha, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And he said to them, that so it is written, and so it was just, that the Meshicha should suffer, and should rise from among the dead in the three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that in his name should be preached repentance and the forgiveness of sins among all nations, and that the commencement should be from Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are the witnesses of these. And I will send upon you the promise of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>But await you in Urishlem the city until you be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he brought them out unto Bethania, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it was that while he blessed them, he was separated from them, and he ascended to the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshipped him, and returned to Urishlem with great joy. And at all time were they in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>praising and blessing Aloha. Amen.</verse>
