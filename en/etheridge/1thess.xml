      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>PAULOS, and Sylvanos, and Timotheos, to the church of the Thesalonikoyee which (is) in Aloha the Father, and in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. Grace be with you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to Aloha at all time for you all and are mindful of you in our prayers constantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>and remember before Aloha the Father the works of your faith, and the labour of your love, and the perseverance of your hope, which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>For we know your election, my brethren, beloved of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our preaching was not in words only with you, but with power, and with the Spirit of Holiness, and with the persuasion of truth. Also you know how we were among you, on account of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>and you became imitators of us and of our Lord, and you received the word in great affliction, and with the joy of the Spirit of Holiness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>and became an example to all the believers who are in Makedunia and in Akaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you was made to be heard the word of our Lord, not only in Makedunia and in Akaia, but in every place your faith which is in Aloha was made to be heard, so that we have no need to say of you any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they learned what an entrance we had unto you, and how you turned to Aloha, from the fear of idols, to worship Aloha the living and the true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>awaiting his Son from heaven, Jeshu himself, whom he raised from among the dead, and who delivered us from the wrath that cometh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>And you know, my brethren, that our entrance unto you was not in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, in Philipos, and then (even) in great conflict we spoke with you with the confidence of our God the gospel of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation was not from deceit, nor from uncleanness, nor from guile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as approved of Aloha to be intrusted with his gospel, so speaking as not to please men, but Aloha who trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For never have we used flattering speech, as you know, nor for an occasion of covetousness, Aloha witnesseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Neither have we sought glory from men, either from you or from others, though we could have been honoured ones, as the apostles of the Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>but we were humble among you, and, as a nurse who loveth her children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so also we loved, and were desirous to impart to you, not only the gospel of Aloha, but also our life, because we loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>Remember, therefore, my brethren, how we laboured and toiled in the work of our hands by night and by day, that we might not be a burden on one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You witness and Aloha, how we preached to you the gospel of Aloha, purely and justly, and were without blame with all the faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As you know how every one of you, as a father his children, we exhorted, and spoke with your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and (now) we testify to you how you should walk worthy of Aloha himself who hath called you to his kingdom and to his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>WHEREFORE we also give thanks constantly unto Aloha, that the word of Aloha which you received from us, was not as the word of man (that) you received (it), but, as it is truly, the word of Aloha, which in operation worketh (alike) in you and in all them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>But you, my brethren, have become like the churches of Aloha which are in Jihud, who are in Jeshu Meshiha, because you likewise suffer from your fellow-country-men, as they also from the Jihudoyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and the prophets who were of them, and ourselves have persecuted, and Aloha have not pleased,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>and have acted adversely to all men; who forbid us to speak with the Gentiles that they might be saved; to fill up their sins for all time: but upon them cometh the wrath unto the end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>BUT we, my brethren, having been bereaved-ones of you the time of an hour, as to our presence, but not in our heart, have been the more solicitous to see your faces with great love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>and have wished to come to you (even) I, Paulos, one time and two; but Satana hindered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope and our joy, and the crown of our glorying, but you, before our Lord Jeshu at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>And because we could not endure, we were willing to be left at Athinos alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and to send to you Timotheos our brother, a minister of Aloha and our helper in the gospel of the Meshiha, to fortify you, and inquire of you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that none of you should be slain through these afflictions; for you know that to this we are set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For while also we were with you, we foretold you that we were to be afflicted, as you know that it hath been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>On account of this also, I, not enduring until I had sent to know your faith, lest the tempter should tempt you, and we should have laboured in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>but now when Timotheos came to us from among you, and gave us intelligence of your faith and of your love, and that you have a good remembrance of us in every season, and desire to see us as we also (to see) you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>on this account we were comforted in you, my brethren, in all our anxieties and our afflictions because of your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>And now we live, if you are established in our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks giving can we render on account of you to Aloha, over all the joy with which we rejoice on your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>unless before Aloha we supplicate exceedingly by night and by day to see your faces, and to perfect what is wanting to your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>But Aloha himself, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, will make straight our way to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and he will cause your love to increase to one another, and to every man, even as we love you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>and will establish your hearts without blame in holiness, before Aloha our Father, at the advent of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>HENCE then, my brethren, we pray of you, and beseech of you by our Lord Jeshu, that as you have received of us how it behoveth you to walk and to please Aloha, the more to increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know those precepts we gave to you in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of Aloha, your sanctification; and that you be distant from all fornication;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>and that every man of you know to possess his vessel in sanctification and in honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>and not in the passions of concupiscence, as the rest of the Gentiles who know not Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>And that you dare not transgress, and defraud the one man his brother in this matter, because our Lord is the avenger of all these, as we have also before told you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For Aloha hath not called us to uncleanness, but unto sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore, whoever despiseth, not man he despiseth, but Aloha, who hath ingiven you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning the love of the brethren, you need not (that I) write to you; for you yourselves are taught of Aloha to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And so do you to all the brethren who are in all Makedunia; but I beseech of you, my brethren, to excel .</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>And study to be quiet and be occupied with your own employments, and work with your hands, as we have admonished you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk becomingly towards the outward-ones, and of man you may not need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>BUT I wish you to know, my brethren, that for those who are asleep you should not have sorrow, as the rest of men, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jeshu died and arose, so also Aloha those who have slept in Jeshu will bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>But this we say to you by the word of our Lord, that we who remaining at the coming of our Lord, who live, will not precede those who have slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>For our Lord himself with the mandate, and with the voice of the chief of angels, and with the trumpet of Aloha, will come down from heaven, and the dead who are in the Meshiha will arise first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>and then we who remaining alive, shall be rapt with them together in clouds, to the meeting of our Lord in the expanse; and so always with our Lord shall we be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But of the times and the seasons, my brethren, you need not that I write to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for you truly know that the day of our Lord as a thief in the night so cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>While they shall be saying, Peace and tranquillity, then unawares will destruction arise against them, as distress upon the child-bearer, and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, my brethren, are not in darkness, that that day as a thief should overtake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>For all of you are sons of light, and sons of the day; and are not sons of the night, nor sons of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Sleep we not, therefore, as the rest; but be wakeful and sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they who sleep, in the night sleep; and they who are drunken, in the night are drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But we who are sons of the day must be wakeful in our minds, and wear the mail-coat of faith and of love, and put on the helmet of the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For Aloha hath not appointed us to wrath, but to the possession of salvation in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died on our behalf, that, whether we wake or sleep, together with him we may live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore comfort one another, and edify one another, as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>BUT I entreat of you, my brethren, to know them who labour among you, and stand before your faces teaching you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>that they be esteemed by you in abundant love; and on account of their work be at peace with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>And I entreat of you, my brethren, (to) admonish the offenders, and encourage the little of soul, and bear the burden of the weak, and prolong your spirit toward every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>And beware, lest any of you evil render for evil; but always follow after (those things which are) good (pl.) toward one another, and toward every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Be joyful always,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>and pray without ceasing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>and in every thing give thanks; for this is the will of Aloha in Jeshu Meshiha concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>The Spirit quench not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Prophecy do not despise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove every thing, and what is good retain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>And from every evil thing flee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>But the God of peace himself will sanctify perfectly all of you; and your whole spirit, and your soul, and your body will he keep without fault, to the coming of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he who hath called you, who himself will do it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>My brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Ask the peace of all our brethren, with the holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you, by our Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with you. Amen.</verse>
