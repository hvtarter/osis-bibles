        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>THE presbyter unto Gaios my beloved, whom I love in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>Our beloved, in all things I pray for thee, that thou mayest prosper and be healthful, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>For I have rejoiced greatly when the brethren have come, and have testified concerning thy integrity, even as in the truth thou walkest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>And greater joy than this I have not (than) when I hear that my sons walk in the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Our beloved, in faithfulness thou performest what thou doest unto the brethren, and especially to those who are strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who have testified of thy charity, before all the church, to whom thou hast done well according to that which is worthy of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>For after his name they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be helpers of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I would have written to the church; but he who loveth to be foremost of you, Diotrapas, receiveth us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>On account of this, if I come, I will remember the works which he doeth, who words of evil maketh concerning us; and these not satisfying him, he hath not received the brethren, and those who receive he forbiddeth, and also expelleth from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Our beloved, be not imitative of the evil, but of the good. He who doeth good is of Aloha, and he who doeth evil hath not seen Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>Concerning Demetrios is a testimony from every man, and from the church, and from the truth itself. But we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>I have many things which I would write to thee, but I will not with ink and reed write to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>But I hope that soon I shall see thee, and mouth to mouth we will speak. Peace be with thee. The friends ask thy peace. Ask the peace of the friends each by his name.</verse>
