      <chapter osisID='Jude.1'>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.1'>JIHUDA, servant of Jeshu Meshiha, but brother of Jakub, to the called people, who are beloved of Aloha the Father, (and) in Jeshu Meshiha preserved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>Mercy and peace in love be multiplied unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>My beloved, while giving all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, it is needful for me to write to you, exhorting you (in particular) to do battle for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>For certain men have obtained entrance, who from the beginning were proscribed in this condemnation; depraved men, who the grace of Aloha turn unto lasciviousness, and him who is the only Lord GOD, our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, deny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>But I will to remind you, though all of you know, that Aloha, when once the people from Metsreen he had redeemed, yet afterward destroyed them who believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>And the angels who kept not their primacy, but left their habitation, unto the judgment of the great day in chains unknown, under darkness, he hath kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>As Sadum and Omuro, and the cities which were around them, which in manner of them committed fornication, and went after other flesh, are lying under everlasting fire, condemned unto judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>In this manner also (will perish) those who, in sleep imagining, defile the flesh, but contemn government, and blaspheme majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>Yet Mikael, chief of angels, when, with the accuser speaking, he contended on account of the body of Musha, dared not bring against him a reviling judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>But these the things which they know not revile; but through those by which naturally as the beasts they are swayed, they are corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>Woe to them; for in the way of Koen they have gone, and after the error of Belam for gain they have burned, and in the rebellion of Kurach they have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are they who, in their recreations contaminating, behave wantonly, feeding themselves without reverence; clouds without rain, roaming with the winds; trees whose fruit withereth, and which are unfruitful, twice dead, and uplifted from their root;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>turbulent waves of the sea, which, by their foaming, manifest their shame; erring stars, unto whom the blackness of darkness that is eternal is reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>But Hanuk also, who was the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh, with myriads of his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>To execute judgment upon all; And to convict all the wicked for all their deeds Which they have wickedly done; And for all those obdurate words Which ungodly sinners have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are they who murmur and complain of every thing, while walking according to their own desires; their mouth speaking portentous things, and extolling persons for the sake of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>But you, my beloved, remember those words which before were spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>who told you that in the last times there would be those who scoff, who according to their own desires go after wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>These are they who separate;-animals, in whom the Spirit is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>But you, my beloved, in your holy faith be edified anew, praying in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>ourselves in the love of Aloha to keep, while looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha unto our eternal salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>And some of them snatch from the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>But when they repent, have compassion on them, with fear, hating even the tunic which by the flesh is contaminated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>But to him who is able to keep you without falling and without spot, and to establish you without blemish, Aloha our only Saviour by Jeshu Meshiha our Lord, before his majesty with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>Be glory, and dominion, and honour, and grandeur, both now and in all ages. Amen.</verse>
