      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>PAULOS, a servant of Jeshu Meshiha, called, and an apostle, who hath been separated unto the gospel of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which from of old he had promised by the hand of the prophets, in the holy writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, who was born, according to the flesh, of the seed of the house of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and is known (to be) the Son of Aloha by power, and by the Holy Spirit, who raised him from among the dead, Jeshu Meshiha our Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>by whom we have received grace and apostleship among all nations, that they should become obedient unto the faith of his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>and you also are of them, called in Jeshu Meshiha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all who are in Ruma, beloved of Aloha, called and saints; peace and grace be with you from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I praise my God through Jeshu Meshiha on behalf of you all, that your faith is heard (of) in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For a witness unto me is Aloha, whom I serve in the spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing at all time I remember you in my prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>And I pray that from now there may be opened unto me the way, by the will of Aloha, to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I greatly desire to see you, and to impart to you the gift of the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that thereby you may be established, and that together we may be comforted by your faith and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>BUT I will that you know, my brethren, that many times I have willed to come to you, and have been hindered until this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>that among you also I may have fruit as among the rest of the nations of the Javnoyee and Barbaroyee, the wise and the foolish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>because to every man am I obligated to preach; and so am I urged to evangelize unto you also who are in Ruma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of Aloha for the salvation of all who believe in him, whether of the Jihudoyee first, or of the Aramoyee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>for the righteousness of Aloha in it is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The righteous by faith shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of Aloha is revealed from heaven against all the unrighteousness and depravity of the sons of men, who the truth in unrighteousness detain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because the knowledge of Aloha is revealed in them; for Aloha revealed it in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the occult things of Aloha from the foundations of the world, unto his creatures by intelligence are apparent, and his power and his Godhead eternal, that they may be without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>For when they knew Aloha, they did not as Aloha glorify him and praise him, but became vain in their imaginations, and their heart was darkened, that they understood not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>And while thinking in themselves that they were wise, they were fools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>And they changed the glory of Aloha the Incorruptible into the likeness of the image of corruptible man, and into the likeness of birds and of four-footed (beasts) and of reptiles of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Because of this Aloha delivered them up to the unclean lusts of their hearts, that they would debase their bodies among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>And they changed the truth of Aloha into a lie, and worshipped and served the creatures rather than their Creator, to whom be praises and blessings for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>WHEREFORE Aloha delivered them up to passions of vileness: for their females changed the use of their nature, and to what is not natural were used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And also their males likewise left the natural use of their females, and were inflamed with concupiscence one with another, and male with male wrought shamefulness, and the just retribution for their perverseness in themselves received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they did not decide in themselves to know Aloha, so did Aloha cause them to be delivered up to a mind of vainness, and to do what is not fit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all wickedness, and uncleanness, and rancour, and malice, and rapacity, and envy, and murder, and contention, and deceit, and evil imaginings, and murmurings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>and slanders, and hating of Aloha: vilifiers, inflated ones, boasters, inventors of evil things, mindless, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>(men) to whom a compact is nothing, and (who) neither love peace nor (have) mercy in them; who,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>knowing the judgment of Aloha, that they who these things do, unto death are condemned, (yet) not only do them, but also participate with those who do them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore thou hast no excuse, O man, who judgest thy neighbour; for in that for which thou judgest thy neighbour, thou condemnest thyself; for in those which thou judgest, thou also art conversant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>AND we know what is the judgment of Aloha in truth against them who in these things converse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>But thinkest thou, O man, who judgest them who in these converse, while thou also conversest in them, that thou wilt escape the judgment of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or upon the riches of his goodness, and upon his long-suffering, and upon the space he giveth thee, presumest thou? and knowest not that the goodness of Aloha unto repentance leadeth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>Yet, through the hardness of thy unrepenting heart, layest thou up the treasure of wrath for the day of wrath, and the revelation of the just judgment of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who rendereth to every man according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To them who seek, in perseverance of good works, glory and honour and incorruption, he giveth eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but to them who are rebellious, and obey not the truth, but unrighteousness obey, he will render wrath and indignation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>and affliction and distress, upon every man who worketh evils; to Jihudoyee first, and to Aramoyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory and honour and peace to every one who worketh good, to the Jihudoya first, and also to the Aramoya;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>for there is no acceptance of faces with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For they who without the law have sinned, without the law also will perish: and they who in the law have sinned, by the law will be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>For not the hearers of the law are righteous before Aloha, but the doers of the law are justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>FOR if the Gentiles, who have not the law, from their nature shall perform the law, these, while not having the law, unto themselves become a law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>And these show the work of law written upon their hearts, and their conscience testifieth of them, while their reasonings accuse or excuse one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in the day when Aloha judgeth the secrets of men according to my gospel by Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if thou (who) a Jihudoya art called, and reposest on the law, and boastest in Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>because thou knowest his will, and distinguishest the things that are fitting, because thou art learned from the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and confidest upon thyself that thou art a guide of the blind, and a light to those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>and an instructor of the wanting-in-mind, and a teacher of children, and hast a type of knowledge and of truth in the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>Thou, then, who teachest others, dost thou not teach thyself? and who preachest that men should not steal, dost thou steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>and who sayest they should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? And thou who condemnest idols, dost thou despoil the sanctuary?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>And thou who boastest of the law, in this that thou transgressest against the law, Aloha himself despisest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For the name of Aloha through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For circumcision profiteth, if thou accomplish the law; but if thou transgress the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcisedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>But if the uncircumcision shall keep the commandment of the law, is not uncircumcisedness reckoned to him (as) circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And the uncircumcision, who by nature accomplishes the law will judge thee, who with the scripture and with circumcision, transgressest against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>FOR it is not in outwardness that he is a Jihudoya nor is that which is seen in the flesh circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he is a Jihudoya who is one in inwardness; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not from the sons of men, but from Aloha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then is the excellence of the Jihudoya, and what the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every thing: primarily that they had intrusted (to them) the words of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For if some of them believed not, would their unbelief abolish the faithfulness of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Not so: for Aloha is true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be just in thy words, And triumph when they judge thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our iniquity the righteousness of Aloha establisheth, what shall we say? Is Aloha evil, who bringeth his wrath? As a man do I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Not so; otherwise how shall Aloha judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if the truth of Aloha is promoted by my lie unto his glory, why then am I judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>Or why, as certain blaspheme concerning us, affirming that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come? they, whose condemnation is reserved by justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then, have we attained excellence? (No.) For before we decided of the Jihudoyee and of the Aramoyee that they are all under sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>as it is written, None is righteous, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>None understandeth or seeketh Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All have declined together and are reprobate, And there is none that doeth good, not one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Open sepulchres are their throats, Their tongues have deceived, And the venom of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>And their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Crushing and misery are in their ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace they have not known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>And the fear of Aloha is not before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>BUT we know that whatever the law saith, to them who are under the law it saith: that every mouth may be shut, and all the world be guilty unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Because by the works of the law no flesh is justified before him; for from the law sin is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, without the law the righteousness of Aloha is revealed, and the law and the prophets (themselves) testify of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>But the righteousness of Aloha is by faith of Jeshu Meshiha, unto all and also upon all who believe in him. For there is no distinction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned, and have failed of the glory of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>and all are justified by grace freely, and (that) through the redemption which is in Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom Aloha before ordained (to be) a propitiation through faith in his blood for our sins which from the first we had sinned, within the space which Aloha hath given to us in his patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>unto the manifestation of his righteousness which (is) in this time: that he might be just, and might justify in righteousness him who is in the faith of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where, then, is boasting? It is abolished. By what law? of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We comprehend, therefore, that by faith man is justified, and not by the works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is Aloha of the Jihudoyee only, and not of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Because one is Aloha, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, also the uncircumcision by the same faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we therefore the law abolish by faith? Not so, but the law itself we establish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then say we of Abraham, the chief of the fathers, that he found in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham by works was justified, he had cause for boasting; but not with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? That Abraham believed Aloha, and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>But to him who worketh, his wages are not reckoned to him as of favour, but as that which is owing to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>but to him who worketh not, but believeth only in him who justifieth sinners, his faith is reckoned to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>As also David hath spoken concerning the blessedness of the man to whom Aloha reckoneth righteousness without works, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Blessed are they whose iniquity is forgiven, And whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom Aloha reckoneth not his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessedness, then, upon the circumcision (only), or upon the uncircumcision (also)? Now we have said, that his faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>When, then, was it reckoned to him? In circumcision or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>For he received the sign of circumcision (as) a seal of the righteousness of his faith, which (was his) in uncircumcision, that he should be the father of all them who believe of the uncircumcision; that it might be accounted also to them for righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father of the circumcision, not of them who are of the circumcision only, but of them who pursue the footsteps of the faith of uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>FOR not through the law was the promise unto Abraham and to his seed that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law were heirs, faith would be vain, and the promise be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the law is the worker of wrath. For where there is no law, there also is no transgression of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is by faith, which is through grace, that we are justified, that the promise might be firm unto all his seed; not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(as it is written, I have ordained thee the father of many nations before Aloha, in whom thou hast believed, who maketh alive the dead, and calleth those who are not as though they were:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>and who, without hope, unto hope believed that he should be the father of many nations, as it is written, that " so shall be thy seed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>Nor was he weak in his faith, while considering his body dead, (for he was the son of an hundred years,) and the dead womb of Sara;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>and at the promise of Aloha he wavered not as deficient in faith, but was strong in faith, and gave glory to Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and was sure that what he had promised to him Aloha could fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Wherefore it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>And not for his sake only was this written, that his faith was reckoned for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for our sake, because it should be reckoned to us also who believe in Him who hath raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered for our sins, and rose that he might justify us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>BECAUSE, then, we are justified by faith, we have peace with Aloha through our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>And by him we have been admitted through faith into this grace in which we stand, and exult in hope of the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not thus only, but also in afflictions we exult; for we know that affliction perfecteth patience in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience experience, and experience hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>but hope maketh us not ashamed, because the love of Aloha is shed forth upon our hearts by the Spirit of Holiness who is given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>But if the Meshiha on account of our infirmity in this time for the wicked hath died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>for hardly for the wicked one dieth; for on account of the good one may perhaps dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>Nevertheless Aloha hath manifested his love for us, in that, when we were sinners, the Meshiha for us died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>how much more, then, shall we be now justified through his blood, and by him be delivered from wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, while we were adversaries, Aloha was reconciled with us through the death of his Son, how much more, then, in reconciliation with him, shall we be saved by his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not thus only, but we also exult in Aloha through our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>As by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, so death hath passed upon all men through this, that all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin, while it was in the world, was not reckoned sin, because the law was not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>yet death reigned from Adam until Musha on them also who had not sinned after the manner of the transgression of the law of Adam, who was the type of him who was to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as was the fall, so is the gift; for if, on account of the fall of one, many died, how much more the grace of Aloha, and his gift, for the sake of one man, Jeshu Meshiha, in many will abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as the transgression of one, so is the gift; for the judgment that was by one was unto condemnation, but the gift (which saves) from many sins was unto righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if because of the transgression of one death was made to reign, much more (shall) they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift and of righteousness, reign in life by one, Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>As then on account of the transgression of one was the condemnation of all men, so, on account of the righteousness of one shall there be acquittal unto the life of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as on account of the disobedience of one man many became sinners, so also on account of the obedience of one many became righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But the entrance which was of the law, (made) sin to increase; and where sin increased, there grace hath abounded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that as sin hath reigned in death, so grace might reign in righteousness unto the life which is eternal, by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>WHAT, then, shall we say, Let us remain in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Not so. For how shall they who are dead to sin live yet in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know, that they who have been baptized into Jeshu Meshiha, into his death have been baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>For we are buried with him by baptism into death; that as Jeshu Meshiha arose from among the dead by the glory of his Father, so also we in a new life shall walk.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>For we know that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be abolished, that more we should not serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who is dead is set free from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>If then we are dead with the Meshiha, we believe that with him, with the Meshiha, we shall live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>for we know that the Meshiha rose from among the dead, and no more dieth, nor hath death dominion over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For he who died on account of sin died once, and he who liveth liveth unto Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>so also reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin, and alive unto Aloha by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin then reign in your dead body, as that you may obey the lusts of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>nor prepare your members the instruments of iniquity unto sin, but prepare yourselves for Aloha, as men who from the dead have been made alive, and your members instruments to be for the righteousness of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not rule over you; for you are not under law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What, then, shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? Not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Know you not, that to whomsoever you prepare yourselves to obey him unto service, of him you are the servants, of him whom you obey; whether of sin, or of the hearing of the ear of righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But praise to Aloha that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine to which you have been delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And when you were made free from sin, you became obedient to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>As among men I speak, because of the infirmity of your flesh, that as you have prepared your members for the service of uncleanness and of iniquity, so also now prepare ye your members for the service of righteousness and of holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>And what product had you then from that of which to-day you are ashamed? For the end of it is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>And now made free from sin, and become servants to Aloha, you have holy fruits, of which the end is the life of eternity.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>BUT know you not, my brethren, for to those who know the law I speak, that the law has authority over a man as long as he liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>as a woman who is bound in law to her husband as long as he liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>But if, while her husband lives, she adhere to another man, she becometh an adulteress; but if her husband shall die, she is freed from the law, and is not an adulteress, though she become (the wife) of another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>And now, my brethren, you also are dead to the law, through the body of the Meshiha, that you should be married to another, (namely, to) him who rose from the dead, that you may render fruit unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For while we were in the flesh, the affections of sin, which are against the law, wrought powerfully in our members to yield fruits unto death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>but now we are loosed from the law, and are dead to that which held us, that we might serve henceforth in the newness of the spirit, and not in the oldness of the writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What then, say we the law is sin? Not so. But sin I had not learned (to know) but by the law: for I had not known concupiscence (to be sinful), but (by) the law, which hath said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>And by this commandment sin found for itself an occasion, and completed in me all concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>But I was alive without the law formerly: but when the commandment came, sin lived, and I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And that commandment of life was found to me (to tend) unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, by the occasion it found through the commandment, deceived me, and thereby killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>The law therefore is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>The good, then, unto me, unto death was made? Not so. But sin, that it might be seen what sin is, by the good (law) effected death in me, that sin might be the more condemned by the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, and sold unto sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For what I work, I know not; and not that which I will, I do; but what I hate, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>And if the thing that I would not, I do, I witness of the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now it is not I who work this, but sin which dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, but that is in my flesh, good dwelleth not; because to will the good is easy to me, but to perform it I find not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I will to do, I do not; but the evil that I will not to do, that do I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>And if the thing that I will not I do, it is not I who do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law which accordeth with my mind, that willeth to do good, because evil is near to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I rejoice in the law of Aloha in the interior man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members, which warreth against the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I give thanks to Aloha! (it is) by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. Now then, I in my mind am the servant of the law of Aloha, but in my flesh I am the servant of the law of sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>Hence, there is no condemnation to them who do not walk according to the flesh, in Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life, which is in Jeshu Meshiha, hath set thee free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>Because the law was weak through the infirmity of the flesh, Aloha sent his Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, on account of sin to condemn sin in his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>that the righteousness of the law might in us be fulfilled, who walk not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they who are in the flesh, of that flesh are mindful; and they who are of the Spirit, of that Spirit are mindful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind of the flesh is death, and the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind of the flesh is enmity towards Aloha; for to the law of Aloha it is not subject, for it cannot be;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if truly the Spirit of Aloha dwelleth in you. But if a man have not the Spirit of the Meshiha, this (man) is not his.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead dwell in you, he who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead will also make alive your dead bodies, on account of his Spirit who dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Now, my brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, that according to the flesh we should walk.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For they who by the Spirit of Aloha are led, they are the sons of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if sons, heirs also; heirs of Aloha, and the sons of the inheritance of Jeshu Meshiha. For if we suffer with him, with him also shall we be glorified.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the whole creation hopeth and waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation hath been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but on account of him who subjected her, upon the hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creation herself also shall be made free from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that all creatures groan and travail until this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>and not only they, but we also who have in us the first-fruit of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, and wait for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For in hope we live: but hope that is seen is not hope; for if we see it, why hope we for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which is not seen, in patience we wait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>So also the Spirit helpeth our infirmity: for what to pray for as we ought we know not; but the Spirit himself prayeth on our behalf in groanings unspoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searcheth the hearts, he knoweth the mind of the Spirit, who, according to the will of Aloha, prayeth for the saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say of these? If Aloha be for us, who is against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>And if his Son be spared not, but for all of us delivered him up, how will he not with him give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who is against the chosen of Aloha? Aloha justifieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who condemneth? The Meshiha hath died and arisen, and is at the right hand of Aloha, and prayeth for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>As it is written: For thee all the day long are we killed, We are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in these we all are victorious by the hand of him who hath loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor authorities, nor powers, nor things subsisting, nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of Aloha which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great grief, and (that) the sorrow of my heart ceaseth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could pray that I myself might be one accursed from Meshiha instead of my brethren and my kinsmen who are in the flesh;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>And if the branches were cut off, and thou who art a wild olive art engrafted in their place, and hast a participation of the root and fatness of the olive,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>And perhaps thou wilt say, The branches were cut off, and I in their place am engrafted:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well, they on account of unbelief were cut off, and thou by faith standest: be not exalted in thy mind, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>If Aloha spared not them who were branches by nature, (take heed) lest he spare not thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold, then, the goodness and the severity of Aloha: towards them who fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; if not, thou also wilt be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they, if they continue not in their want of faith, they also shall be engrafted; for Aloha is able again to engraft them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if thou who art of the wild olive which is thy nature, wast cut off, and, which was not thy nature, art engrafted into the good olive, how much more they, if they are engrafted into the olive of their nature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>But I would have you know, my brethren, this mystery, that you may not be wise in your own mind,-that blindness of heart for a little space is unto Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be brought in:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>But, in (regard of) the gospel, they are enemies on your account; and, in the election, they are beloved on account of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For Aloha turneth not in his gift and in his vocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you also were not obedient unto Aloha at the first, and now have received mercy through their disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so also these are now disobedient for the mercy that is upon you, that upon them also might be mercy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I BESEECH then of you, my brethren, by the mercies of Aloha, that you present your bodies a sacrifice, living and holy and acceptable unto Aloha, in a rational service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not likened unto this world, but be changed by the renewing of your minds, that you may discern what is the will of Aloha, good, and acceptable, and perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>But I tell you all through the grace which is given to me, that you are not to think beyond what it is proper to think; but that you think with sobriety, every man as Aloha hath divided to him faith in measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as in one body we have many members, and as all the members have not one work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so also we who are many are one body in the Meshiha; but we are each of us members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>But we have various gifts according to the grace that is given to us: is it prophecy? (let him who has received it) prophesy according to the measure of the faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>he who is an exhorter, in his exhorting; as he who giveth, (let him give with simplicity;) and he who presideth, (let it be) with diligence; and he who (is engaged in works) of mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>And let not your love be guileful; abhor things evil, cleave to the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Be tender to your brethren, and love one another, being forward to honour one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>And what you think of yourselves, (that) also think of your brethren; nor think with a high mind, but incline to them who are humble; and be not wise in the conceit of your own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>And repay to no man evil for evil, but be careful to do good before all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>And if possible, as much as is in you, with all men make peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>And avenge not yourselves, my beloved, but give place unto wrath; for it is written, that if thou execute not judgment for thyself, I will execute thy judgment, saith Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>And if thy adversary hunger, feed him; and if he thirst, give him drink: and if these things thou do unto him, coals of fire thou wilt heap upon his head.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>LET every soul to the powers of dominion be subject. For there is no power that is not from Aloha, and the powers that be, of Aloha are they instituted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whoever then riseth up against the power, against the institution of Aloha he riseth; and they who arise against them will receive judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For judges are not a terror to the workers of good, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do good, and thou shalt have praise from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is the servant of Aloha, but to thee for good: and if thou do evil, fear; for not in vain is he girded with the sword; for he is the servant of Aloha, and the dispenser of wrath to them who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>And because of this are we bound to be subject, not for the wrath only, but also because of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>On this account also give we tribute to them; for they are the servants of Aloha over these things constituted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to every man as is due to him: to whom tribute (is due,) tribute; and to whom custom, custom; and to whom reverence, reverence; and to whom honour, honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>And to no man owe any thing, but one another to love. For whoever loveth his neighbour fulfilleth the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>for that also which it hath said, Thou shalt not kill; and, Thou shalt not commit adultery; and, Thou shalt not steal; and, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, in this word it is accomplished, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love unto his neighbour evil worketh not: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>AND also this know, that the time is, and the hour is, when we should be awake from our sleep; for now hath drawn nearer to us our salvation than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night now passeth away, and the day hath drawn nigh; put we away then from us the works of darkness, and let us clothe with the arms of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>And as in the day, let us walk decorously, not with the song, nor with drunkenness, nor in the unclean chamber, nor in envy and in contention;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>but let (every one) clothe himself with our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and care not for your flesh unto the lusts (thereof).</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>But to him who is weak in the faith give the hand, and be not divided in your thoughts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>For there are some who believe that one may eat every thing, and he who is weak; eateth (only) the herb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>But let not him who eateth despise him who eateth not; and he who eateth not, let him not judge him who eateth; for Aloha hath received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art thou that judgest a servant who is not thine? who, if he stand, unto his Lord he standeth, and if he fall, falleth unto his Lord. But standing, he standeth; for there is power in the hands of his Lord to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>There is who distinguisheth day from day, and there is who judgeth all days (to be alike); but let every man in the conviction of his (own) mind be confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who thinketh of the day, to his Lord he thinketh; and every one who thinketh not of the day, unto his Lord he thinketh not (of it). He who eateth, to his Lord he eateth, and to Aloha giveth thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>and he who eateth not, to his Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to Aloha. For there is no one of us who to himself liveth and no one who to himself dieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For if we live, to our Lord we live; and if we die, to our Lord we die: and if we live, then, or if we die, our Lord's are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>Because of this also the Meshiha died and lived and arose, that he might be Lord of the dead and of the living. But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>Or thou, also, why despisest thou thy brother? For we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Meshiha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>as it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, unto me every knee shall bow, and to me shall every tongue confess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>Therefore, every one of us the answer for himself shall give unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Then judge not one another, but this determine rather, to lay not a stumbling-block for thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>For I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jeshu, that a thing which is unclean from itself is not (so); but to him who judgeth of any thing that it is polluted, to him only it is polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if on account of meat thou grievest thy brother, thou walkest not in love: destroy not by thy meat him on account of whom the Meshiha died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not our good (things) be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of Aloha is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For who in these things serveth the Meshiha pleaseth Aloha, and before men is approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Now, after peace let us pursue, and after the edification of one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>and not for the sake of meats undo the work of Aloha. For each thing is pure, yet evil is it to the man who eateth with offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is well not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing by which our brother is offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast thou confidence? In thyself retain it before Aloha. Blessed is he who condemneth not himself in what he distinguisheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>For he who doubteth and eateth is made guilty, because he eateth not with confidence. For every thing that is not of confidence is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>WE then, the strong, are obligated to bear up the infirmities of the weak, and not ourselves to please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>But let every one of us please his neighbour in good things as unto edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>Because the Meshiha also pleased not himself; but as it is written, The reproach of thy reproachers hath fallen upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>For every thing that hath before been written for our instruction was written, that by the patience and consolation of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>But the God of patience and of consolation give to you that with impartiality you may think one of another in Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>that with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify Aloha, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore, receive and bear with one another, as also the Meshiha hath received you, to the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>But I say that Jeshu Meshiha ministered the circumcision, on behalf of the truth of Aloha, that he might confirm the promise of the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and the Gentiles might glorify Aloha for his mercy that was upon them. As it is written, I will confess thee among the Gentiles, And to thy name will I sing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again he hath said, Be glad, ye Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again he hath said, Praise the Lord, all (ye) Gentiles; Let all peoples praise him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again, Eshaia hath said, There shall be a root of Jeshai, And he who shall arise shall be the chief of the peoples; And upon him will the Gentiles hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>But the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace, through faith, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>BUT I am persuaded also concerning you, my brethren, that you are also full of good, and filled with all knowledge, and able also to instruct others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have somewhat boldly written to you, my brethren, as that I may put you in remembrance, through the grace which is given to me from Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>to be a minister of Jeshu Meshiha among the Gentiles, and to labour in the gospel of Aloha, that there may be an oblation of the Gentiles, acceptable and holy through the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have, then, exultation in Jeshu Meshiha with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I dare not speak any thing which the Meshiha hath not done by my hands, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, in word and in deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>with the power of signs and miracles, and with the power of the Spirit of Aloha; as that I have itinerated from Urishlem unto Illyrikum, to fulfil the preaching of Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>being anxious to preach, not where the name of Meshiha had been called, that I might not build upon another foundation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but as it is written, They to whom it hath not been told of him, they shall see him; and they who have not heard shall be persuaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>On this account I have been hindered many times when I would have come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, because I have no place in these countries, and have desired for many years to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>when I go into Ispania, I hope to come and see you; and you shall lead me thitherward, when I shall in some measure have been gladdened with the sight of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I go to Urishlem to minister to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For they in Makedunia and in Akaia have desired that a communication should be made from themselves with the poor and the saints who are at Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They have desired (this), because they also are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have participated with them in the Spirit, they are indebted to serve them in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>This, then, when I have accomplished, and have sealed to them this fruit, I (intend to) pass by you into Ispania.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from them who believe not in Jihud, and (that) the service which I bear to the saints may be well received,</verse>
